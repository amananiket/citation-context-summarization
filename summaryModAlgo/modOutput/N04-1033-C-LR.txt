today's statistical machine translation systems rely on high quality phrase translation pairs to acquire state-of-the-art performance, see (koehn et al, 2003; zens and ney, 2004; och and ney, 2003). 
more details about the baseline system can be found in (zens and ney, 2004; zens et al, 2005). 
for the confidence measures which will be introduced in section 5, we use a state-of-the-art phrasebased approach as described in (zens and ney, 2004). 
(zens and ney, 2004) describe a noisy-or combination: p(sj|Ëœt) = 1âˆ’p(Â¯sj|Ëœt) â‰ˆ 1âˆ’ Ëœiproductdisplay i=1 (1âˆ’p(sj|ti)) where Â¯sj is the probability that sj is not in the translation of Ëœt, and p(sj|ti) is a lexical probability.
