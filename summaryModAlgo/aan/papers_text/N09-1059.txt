Abstract
This paper reports the effect of corpus size on
case frame acquisition for discourse analysis
in Japanese. For this study, we collected a
Japanese corpus consisting of up to 100 bil-
lion words, and constructed case frames from
corpora of six different sizes. Then, we ap-
plied these case frames to syntactic and case
structure analysis, and zero anaphora resolu-
tion. We obtained better results by using case
frames constructed from larger corpora; the
performance was not saturated even with a
corpus size of 100 billion words.
1 Introduction
Very large corpora obtained from the Web have
been successfully utilized for many natural lan-
guage processing (NLP) applications, such as prepo-
sitional phrase (PP) attachment, other-anaphora res-
olution, spelling correction, confusable word set dis-
ambiguation and machine translation (Volk, 2001;
Modjeska et al, 2003; Lapata and Keller, 2005; At-
terer and Schu?tze, 2006; Brants et al, 2007).
Most of the previous work utilized only the sur-
face information of the corpora, such as n-grams,
co-occurrence counts, and simple surface syntax.
This may be because these studies did not require
structured knowledge, and for such studies, the size
of currently available corpora is considered to have
been almost enough. For instance, while Brants et
al. (2007) reported that translation quality continued
to improve with increasing corpus size for training
language models at even size of 2 trillion tokens, the
increase became small at the corpus size of larger
than 30 billion tokens.
However, for more complex NLP tasks, such as
case structure analysis and zero anaphora resolution,
it is necessary to obtain more structured knowledge,
such as semantic case frames, which describe the
cases each predicate has and the types of nouns that
can fill a case slot. Note that case frames offer not
only the knowledge of the relationships between a
predicate and its particular case slot, but also the
knowledge of the relationships among a predicate
and its multiple case slots. To obtain such knowl-
edge, very large corpora seem to be necessary; how-
ever it is still unknown how much corpora would be
required to obtain good coverage.
For examples, Kawahara and Kurohashi pro-
posed a method for constructing wide-coverage case
frames from large corpora (Kawahara and Kuro-
hashi, 2006b), and a model for syntactic and case
structure analysis of Japanese that based upon case
frames (Kawahara and Kurohashi, 2006a). How-
ever, they did not demonstrate whether the coverage
of case frames was wide enough for these tasks and
how dependent the performance of the model was on
the corpus size for case frame construction.
This paper aims to address these questions. We
collect a very large Japanese corpus consisting of
about 100 billion words, or 1.6 billion unique sen-
tences from the Web. Subsets of the corpus are ran-
domly selected to obtain corpora of different sizes
ranging from 1.6 million to 1.6 billion sentences.
We construct case frames from each corpus and ap-
ply them to syntactic and case structure analysis, and
zero anaphora resolution, in order to investigate the
521
relationships between the corpus size and the perfor-
mance of these analyses.
2 Related Work
Many NLP tasks have successfully utilized very
large corpora, most of which were acquired from
the Web (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette, 2003). Volk
(2001) proposed a method for resolving PP attach-
ment ambiguities based upon Web data. Modjeska
et al (2003) used the Web for resolving nominal
anaphora. Lapata and Keller (2005) investigated the
performance of web-based models for a wide range
of NLP tasks, such as MT candidate selection, ar-
ticle generation, and countability detection. Nakov
and Hearst (2008) solved relational similarity prob-
lems using the Web as a corpus.
With respect to the effect of corpus size on NLP
tasks, Banko and Brill (2001a) showed that for
content sensitive spelling correction, increasing the
training data size improved the accuracy. Atterer
and Schu?tze (2006) investigated the effect of cor-
pus size in combining supervised and unsupervised
learning for two types of attachment decision; they
found that the combined system only improved the
performance of the parser for small training sets.
Brants et al (2007) varied the amount of language
model training data from 13 million to 2 trillion to-
kens and applied these models to machine transla-
tion systems. They reported that translation qual-
ity continued to improve with increasing corpus size
for training language models at even size of 2 tril-
lion tokens. Suzuki and Isozaki (2008) provided ev-
idence that the use of more unlabeled data in semi-
supervised learning could improve the performance
of NLP tasks, such as POS tagging, syntactic chunk-
ing, and named entities recognition.
There are several methods to extract useful infor-
mation from very large corpora. Search engines,
such as Google and Altavista, are often used to ob-
tain Web counts (e.g. (Nakov and Hearst, 2005;
Gledson and Keane, 2008)). However, search en-
gines are not designed for NLP research and the re-
ported hit counts are subject to uncontrolled vari-
ations and approximations. Therefore, several re-
searchers have collected corpora from the Web by
themselves. For English, Banko and Brill (2001b)
collected a corpus with 1 billion words from vari-
ety of English texts. Liu and Curran (2006) created
a Web corpus for English that contained 10 billion
words and showed that for content-sensitive spelling
correction the Web corpus results were better than
using a search engine. Halacsy et al (2004) created
a corpus with 1 billion words for Hungarian from
the Web by downloading 18 million pages. Others
utilize publicly available corpus such as the North
American News Corpus (NANC) and the Gigaword
Corpus (Graff, 2003). For instance, McClosky et al
(2006) proposed a simple method of self-training a
two phase parser-reranker system using NANC.
As for Japanese, Kawahara and Kurohashi
(2006b) collected 23 million pages and created a
corpus with approximately 20 billion words. Google
released Japanese n-gram constructed from 20 bil-
lion Japanese sentences (Kudo and Kazawa, 2007).
Several news wires are publicly available consisting
of tens of million sentences. Kotonoha project is
now constructing a balanced corpus of the present-
day written Japanese consisting of 50 million words
(Maekawa, 2006).
3 Construction of Case Frames
Case frames describe the cases each predicate has
and what nouns can fill the case slots. In this study,
case frames we construct case frames from raw cor-
pora by using the method described in (Kawahara
and Kurohashi, 2006b). This section illustrates the
methodology for constructing case frames.
3.1 Basic Method
After parsing a large corpus by a Japanese parser
KNP1, we construct case frames from modifier-head
examples in the resulting parses. The problems for
case frame construction are syntactic and semantic
ambiguities. In other words, the resulting parses in-
evitably contain errors and predicate senses are in-
trinsically ambiguous. To cope with these problems,
we construct case frames from reliable modifier-
head examples.
First, we extract modifier-head examples that had
no syntactic ambiguity, and assemble them by cou-
pling a predicate and its closest case component.
That is, we assemble the examples not by predi-
cates, such as tsumu (load/accumulate), but by cou-

ples, such as nimotsu-wo tsumu (load baggage) and
keiken-wo tsumu (accumulate experience). Such
couples are considered to play an important role
for constituting sentence meanings. We call the as-
sembled examples as basic case frames. In order
to remove inappropriate examples, we introduce a
threshold ? and use only examples that appeared no
less than ? times in the corpora.
Then, we cluster the basic case frames to merge
similar case frames. For example, since nimotsu-
wo tsumu (load baggage) and busshi-wo tsumu (load
supplies) are similar, they are merged. The similar-
ity is measured by using a Japanese thesaurus (The
National Language Institute for Japanese Language,
2004). Table 1 shows examples of constructed case
frames.
3.2 Generalization of Examples
When we use hand-crafted case frames, the data
sparseness problem is serious; by using case frames
automatically constructed from a large corpus, it was
alleviated to some extent but not eliminated. For in-
stance, there are thousands of named entities (NEs)
that cannot be covered intrinsically. To deal with
this problem, we generalize the examples of the case
slots. Kawahara and Kurohashi also generalized ex-
amples but only for a few types. In this study, we
generalize case slot examples based upon common
noun categories and NE classes.
First, we generalize the examples based upon the
categories that tagged by the Japanese morpholog-
ical analyzer JUMAN2. In JUMAN, about 20 cat-
egories are defined and tagged to common nouns.
For example, ringo (apple), inu (dog) and byoin

CILITY, respectively. For each category, we calcu-
late the ratio of the categorized example among all
case slot examples, and add it to the case slot (e.g.
[CT:FOOD]:0.07).
We also generalize the examples based upon NE
classes. We use a common standard NE defini-
tion for Japanese provided by the IREX (1999).
We first recognize NEs in the source corpus by
using an NE recognizer (Sasano and Kurohashi,
2008); and then construct case frames from the NE-
recognized corpus. Similar to the categories, for
each NE class, we calculate the NE ratio among all
the case slot examples, and add it to the case slot
(e.g. [NE:PERSON]:0.12). The generalized exam-
ples are also included in Table 1.
4 Discourse Analysis with Case Frames
In order to investigate the effect of corpus size
on complex NLP tasks, we apply the constructed
cases frames to an integrated probabilistic model
for Japanese syntactic and case structure analysis
(Kawahara and Kurohashi, 2006a) and a probabilis-
tic model for Japanese zero anaphora resolution
(Sasano et al, 2008). In this section, we briefly de-
scribe these models.
523
4.1 Model for Syntactic and Case Structure
Analysis
Kawahara and Kurohashi (2006a) proposed an in-
tegrated probabilistic model for Japanese syntactic
and case structure analysis based upon case frames.
Case structure analysis recognizes predicate argu-
ment structures. Their model gives a probability to
each possible syntactic structure T and case struc-
ture L of the input sentence S, and outputs the syn-
tactic and case structure that have the highest proba-
bility. That is to say, the system selects the syntactic
structure Tbest and the case structure Lbest that max-
imize the probability P (T,L|S):
(Tbest, Lbest) = argmax
(T,L)
P (T,L|S)
= argmax
(T,L)
P (T,L, S) (1)
The last equation is derived because P (S) is con-
stant. P (T,L, S) is defined as the product of a prob-
ability for generating a clause Ci as follows:
P (T,L, S) = ?
i=1..n
P (Ci|bhi) (2)
where n is the number of clauses in S, and bhi is
Ci?s modifying bunsetsu3. P (Ci|bhi) is approxi-
mately decomposed into the product of several gen-
erative probabilities such as P (A(sj) = 1|CFl, sj)
and P (nj |CFl, sj , A(sj) = 1), where the function
A(sj) returns 1 if a case slot sj is filled with an input
case component; otherwise 0. P (A(sj)=1|CFl, sj)
denotes the probability that the case slot sj is filled
with an input case component, and is estimated from
resultant case structure analysis of a large raw cor-
pus. P (nj |CFl, sj , A(sj) = 1) denotes the proba-
bility of generating a content part nj from a filled
case slot sj in a case frame CFl, and is calculated
by using case frames. For details see (Kawahara and
Kurohashi, 2006a).
4.2 Model for Zero Anaphora Resolution
Anaphora resolution is one of the most important
techniques for discourse analysis. In English, overt
pronouns such as she and definite noun phrases such
as the company are anaphors that refer to preced-
ing entities (antecedents). On the other hand, in
3In Japanese, bunsetsu is a basic unit of dependency, con-
sisting of one or more content words and the following zero or
more function words. It corresponds to a base phrase in English.
Japanese, anaphors are often omitted; these omis-
sions are called zero pronouns. Zero anaphora res-
olution is the integrated task of zero pronoun detec-
tion and zero pronoun resolution.
We proposed a probabilistic model for Japanese
zero anaphora resolution based upon case frames
(Sasano et al, 2008). This model first resolves
coreference and identifies discourse entities; then
gives a probability to each possible case frame CF
and case assignment CA when target predicate v,
input case components ICC and existing discourse
entities ENT are given, and outputs the case frame
and case assignment that have the highest probabil-
ity. That is to say, this model selects the case frame
CFbest and the case assignment CAbest that maxi-
mize the probability P (CF,CA|v, ICC,ENT ):
(CF best, CAbest)
= argmax
(CF,CA)
P (CF,CA|v, ICC,ENT ) (3)
P (CF,CA|v, ICC,ENT ) is approximately de-
composed into the product of several probabilities.
Case frames are used for calculating P (nj |CFl,
sj , A(sj) = 1), the probability of generating a con-
tent part nj from a case slot sj in a case frame
CFl, and P (nj |CFl, sj , A?(sj)=1), the probability
of generating a content part nj of a zero pronoun,
where the function A?(sj) returns 1 if a case slot sj
is filled with an antecedent of a zero pronoun; other-
wise 0.
P (nj |CFl, sj , A?(sj)=1) is similar to P (nj |CFl,
sj , A(sj)=1) and estimated from the frequencies of
case slot examples in case frames. However, while
A?(sj)=1 means sj is not filled with an overt argu-
ment but filled with an antecedent of zero pronoun,
case frames are constructed from overt predicate ar-
gument pairs. Therefore, the content part nj is often
not included in the case slot examples. To cope with
this problem, this model also utilizes generalized ex-
amples to estimate P (nj |CFl, sj , A(sj) = 1). For
details see (Sasano et al, 2008).

we constructed case frames from corpora of dif-
ferent sizes. We first collected Japanese sentences

from the Web using the method proposed by Kawa-
hara and Kurohashi (2006b). We acquired approx-
imately 6 billion Japanese sentences consisting of
approximately 100 billion words from 100 million
Japanese web pages. After discarding duplicate sen-
tences, which may have been extracted from mirror
sites, we acquired a corpus comprising of 1.6 bil-
lion (1.6G) unique Japanese sentences consisting of
approximately 25 billion words. The average num-
ber of characters and words in each sentence was
28.3, 15.6, respectively. Then we randomly selected
subsets of the corpus for five different sizes; 1.6M,
6.3M, 25M, 100M, and 400M sentences to obtain
corpora of different sizes.
We constructed case frames from each corpus. We
employed JUMAN and KNP to parse each corpus.
We changed the threshold ? introduced in Section
3.1 depending upon the size of the corpus as shown
in Table 3. Completing the case frame construc-
tion took about two weeks using 600 CPUs. Ta-
ble 4 shows the statistics for the constructed case
frames. The number of predicates, the average num-
ber of examples and unique examples for a case slot,
and whole file size were confirmed to be heavily de-
pendent upon the corpus size. However, the average
number of case frames for a predicate and case slots
for a case frame did not.
5.2 Coverage of Constructed Case Frames
5.2.1 Setting
In order to investigate the coverage of the resul-
tant case frames, we used a syntactic relation, case
structure, and anaphoric relation annotated corpus
consisting of 186 web documents (979 sentences).
This corpus was manually annotated using the same
criteria as Kawahara et al (2004). There were 2,390
annotated relationships between predicates and their
direct (not omitted) case components and 837 zero
anaphoric relations in the corpus.
We used two evaluation metrics depending upon
whether the target case component was omitted or
not. For the overt case component of a predicate, we
judged the target component was covered by case
frames if the target component itself was included in
the examples for one of the corresponding case slots
of the case frame. For the omitted case component,
we checked not only the target component itself but
also all mentions that refer to the same entity as the
target component.
5.2.2 Coverage of Case Frames
Figure 1 shows the coverage of case frames for
the overt argument, which would have tight relations
with case structure analysis. The lower line shows
the coverage without considering generalized exam-
ples, the middle line shows the coverage considering
generalized NE examples, and the upper line shows
the coverage considering all generalized examples.
Figure 2 shows the coverage of case frames for
the omitted argument, which would have tight rela-
tions with zero anaphora resolution. The upper line
shows the coverage considering all generalized ex-
amples, which is considered to be the upper bound
of performance for the zero anaphora resolution sys-

tem described in Section 4.2. Comparing with Fig-
ure 1, we found two characteristics. First, the lower
and middle lines of Figure 2 were located lower than
the corresponding lines in Figure 1. This would re-
flect that some frequently omitted case components
are not described in the case frames because the case
frames were constructed from only overt predicate
argument pairs. Secondly, the effect of generalized
NE examples was more evident for the omitted ar-
gument reflecting the important role of NEs in zero
anaphora resolution.
Both figures show that the coverage was improved
by using larger corpora and there was no saturation
even when the largest corpus of 1.6 billion sentences
was used. When the largest corpus and all general-
ized examples were used, the case frames achieved a
coverage of almost 90% for both the overt and omit-
ted argument.
Figure 3 shows the coverage of case frames for
each predicate type, which was calculated for both
overt and omitted argument considering all general-
ized examples. The case frames for verbs achieved
a coverage of 93.0%. There were 189 predicate-
argument pairs that were not included case frames;

11 pairs of them were due to lack of the case frame
of target predicate itself, and the others were due
to lack of the corresponding example. For adjec-
tive, the coverage was 78.8%. The main cause of
the lower coverage would be that the predicate argu-
ment relations concerning adjectives that were used
in restrictive manner, such as ?oishii sushi? (deli-
cious sushi), were not used for case frame construc-
tion, although such relations were also the target of
the coverage evaluation. For noun with copula, the
coverage was only 54.5%. However, most predicate
argument relations concerning nouns with copula
were easily recognized from syntactic preference,
and thus the low coverage would not quite affect the
performance of discourse analysis.
5.3 Syntactic and Case Structure Analysis
5.3.1 Accuracy of Syntactic Analysis
We investigated the effect of corpus size for syn-
tactic analysis described in Section 4.1. We used
hand-annotated 759 web sentences, which was used
by Kawahara and Kurohashi (2007). We evaluated
the resultant syntactic structures with regard to de-
pendency accuracy, the proportion of correct depen-
dencies out of all dependencies4.
Figure 4 shows the accuracy of syntactic struc-
tures. We conducted these experiments with case
frames constructed from corpora of different sizes.
We also changed the corpus size to estimate gen-
erative probability of a case slot in Section 4.1 de-
pending upon the size of the corpus for case frame
construction as shown in Table 3. Figure 4 also in-
4Note that Kawahara and Kurohashi (2007) exclude the de-
pendency between the last two bunsetsu, since Japanese is head-
final and thus the second last bunsetsu unambiguously depends
on the last bunsetsu.

cludes McNemar?s test results. For instance, the dif-
ference between the corpus size of 1.6G and 100M
sentences is significant at the 90% level (p = 0.1),
but not significant at the 99% level (p = 0.01).
In Figure 4, ?w/o case frames? shows the accu-
racy of the rule-based syntactic parser KNP that does
not use case frames. Since the model described
in Section 4.1 assumes the existence of reasonable
case frames, when we used case frames constructed
from very small corpus, such as 1.6M and 6.3M sen-
tences, the accuracy was lower than that of the rule-
based syntactic parser. Moreover, when we tested
the model described in Section 4.1 without any case
frames, the accuracy was 0.885.
We confirmed that better performance was ob-
tained by using case frames constructed from larger
corpora, and the accuracy of 0.8945 was achieved
by using the case frames constructed from 1.6G sen-
tences. However the effect of the corpus size was
limited. This is because there are various causes
of dependency error and the case frame sparseness
problem is not serious for syntactic analysis.
We considered that generalized examples can
benefit for the accuracy of syntactic analysis, and
tried several models that utilize these examples.
However, we cannot confirm any improvement.
5.3.2 Accuracy of Case Structure Analysis
We conducted case structure analysis on 215 web
sentences in order to investigate the effect of cor-
pus size for case structure analysis. The case mark-
ers of topic marking phrases and clausal modifiers

and case structure of 759 web sentences. Although
the time for analysis became longer by using case
frames constructed from a larger corpus, the growth
rate was smaller than the growth rate of the size for
case frames described in Table 4.
Since there is enough increase in accuracy of case
structure analysis, we can say that case frames con-
structed larger corpora are desirable for case struc-
ture analysis.
5.4 Zero Anaphora Resolution
5.4.1 Accuracy of Zero Anaphora Resolution
We used an anaphoric relation annotated corpus
consisting of 186 web documents (979 sentences)
to evaluate zero anaphora resolution. We used first
51 documents for test and used the other 135 doc-
uments for calculating several probabilities. In the
51 test documents, 233 zero anaphora relations were
annotated between one of the mentions of the an-
tecedent and corresponding predicate that had zero
pronoun.
In order to concentrate on evaluation for zero
anaphora resolution, we used the correct mor-

phemes, named entities, syntactic structures and
coreference relations that were manually annotated.
Since correct coreference relations were given, the
number of created entities was the same between the
gold standard and the system output because zero
anaphora resolution did not create new entities.
The experimental results are shown in Figure 6, in
which F-measure was calculated by:
R = # of correctly recognized zero anaphora# of zero anaphora annotated in corpus ,
P = # of correctly recognized zero anaphora# of system outputted zero anaphora ,
F = 21/R + 1/P .
The upper line shows the performance using all
generalized examples, the middle line shows the
performance using only generalized NEs, and the
lower line shows the performance without using
any generalized examples. While generalized cat-
egories much improved the F-measure, generalized
NEs contributed little. This tendency is similar to
that of coverage of case frames for omitted argument
shown in Figure 2. Unlike syntactic and case struc-
ture analysis, the performance for the zero anaphora
resolution is quite low when using case frames con-
structed from small corpora, and we can say case
frames constructed from larger corpora are essential
for zero anaphora resolution.
5.4.2 Analysis Speed
Table 6 shows the time for resolving zero
anaphora in 51 web documents consisting of 278
sentences. The time for analysis became longer by
using case frames constructed from larger corpora,

which tendency is similar to the growth of the time
for analyzing syntactic and case structure.
5.5 Discussion
Experimental results of both case structure analy-
sis and zero anaphora resolution show the effective-
ness of a larger corpus in case frame acquisition for
Japanese discourse analysis. Up to the corpus size
of 1.6 billion sentences, or 100 billion words, these
experimental results still show a steady increase in
performance. That is, we can say that the corpus
size of 1.6 billion sentences is not enough to obtain
case frames of sufficient coverage.
These results suggest that increasing corpus size
is more essential for acquiring structured knowledge
than for acquiring unstructured statistics of a corpus,
such as n-grams, and co-occurrence counts; and for
complex NLP tasks such as case structure analysis
and zero anaphora resolution, the currently available
corpus size is not sufficient.
Therefore, to construct more wide-coverage case
frames by using a larger corpus and reveal howmuch
corpora would be required to obtain sufficient cov-
erage is considered as future work.
6 Conclusion
This paper has reported the effect of corpus size
on case frame acquisition for syntactic and case
structure analysis, and zero anaphora resolution in
Japanese. We constructed case frames from cor-
pora of six different sizes ranging from 1.6 million
to 1.6 billion sentences; and then applied these case
frames to Japanese syntactic and case structure anal-
ysis, and zero anaphora resolution. Experimental re-
sults showed better results were obtained using case
frames constructed from larger corpora, and the per-
formance showed no saturation even when the cor-
pus size was 1.6 billion sentences.
The findings suggest that increasing corpus size
is more essential for acquiring structured knowledge
than for acquiring surface statistics of a corpus; and
for complex NLP tasks the currently available cor-
pus size is not sufficient.
