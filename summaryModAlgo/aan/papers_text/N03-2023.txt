Abstract
A pseudoword is a composite comprised of two
or more words chosen at random; the individual
occurrences of the original words within a text
are replaced by their conflation. Pseudowords
are a useful mechanism for evaluating the im-
pact of word sense ambiguity in many NLP
applications. However, the standard method
for constructing pseudowords has some draw-
backs. Because the constituent words are cho-
sen at random, the word contexts that surround
pseudowords do not necessarily reflect the con-
texts that real ambiguous words occur in. This
in turn leads to an optimistic upper bound on
algorithm performance. To address these draw-
backs, we propose the use of lexical categories
to create more realistic pseudowords, and eval-
uate the results of different variations of this
idea against the standard approach.
1 Introduction
In order to evaluate a word sense disambiguation (WSD)
algorithm in a new language or domain, a sense-tagged
evaluation corpus is needed, but this is expensive to pro-
duce manually. As an alternative, researchers often use
pseudowords. To create a pseudoword, two or more
randomly-chosen words (e.g., banana and door) are se-
lected and their individual occurrences are replaced by
their conflation (e.g., banana-door). Since their introduc-
tion (Gale et al, 1992; Schuetze, 1992), pseudowords
have been accepted as an upper bound of the true accu-
racy of algorithms that assign word sense distinctions.
In most cases, constituent words are chosen entirely
randomly. When used to evaluate a real WSD system on
the SENSEVAL1 corpus, pseudowords were found to be
optimistic in their estimations compared to real ambigu-
ous words with the same distribution (Gaustad, 2001).
Real ambiguous words often have senses that are similar
in meaning, and thus difficult to distinguish (as measured
by low inter-annotator agreement), while pseudowords,
because they are randomly chosen, are highly likely to
combine semantically distinct words. Another drawback
is that the results produced using pseudowords are dif-
ficult to characterize in terms of the types of ambiguity
they model.
To create more plausibly-motivated pseudoword pair-
ings, we introduce the use of lexical category member-
ship for pseudoword generation. The main idea is to take
note of the relative frequencies at which pairs of lexi-
cal categories tend to represent real ambiguous words,
and then use unambiguous words drawn from those cate-
gories to generate pseudowords. In the remainder of this
paper we describe the category-based pseudoword gener-
ation process and evaluate the results against the standard
methods and against a real word sense disambiguation
task.
2 MeSH and Medline
In this paper we use the MeSH (Medical Subject Head-
ings) lexical hierarchy1, but the approach should be
equally applicable to other domains using other thesauri
and ontologies. In MeSH, each concept is assigned one
or more alphanumeric descriptor codes corresponding
to particular positions in the hierarchy. For example,
A (Anatomy), A01 (Body Regions), A01.456 (Head),
A01.456.505 (Face), A01.456.505.420 (Eye). Eye is
ambiguous according to MeSH and has a second code:
A09.371 (A09 represents Sense Organs).
In the studies reported here, we truncate the MeSH
code at the first period. This allows for generalization
over different words; e.g., for eye, we discriminate be-
tween senses represented by A01 and A09. This trun-
cation reduces the average number of senses per token
from 2.12 to 1.39, and the maximum number of ambigu-
ity classes for a given word to 7; 71.18% of the tokens
have a single class and 22.14% have two classes. From

3 Pseudoword Generation
For the creation of pseudowrods with two-sense ambigui-
ties, we first determined which ambiguous words fall into
exactly two MeSH categories and built a list L of pairs
(see Table 1). We then generated pseudowords with the
following characteristics:
? The two possible pseudoword categories represent a
pair that is really seen in the testing corpus and thus
needs to be disambiguated;
? The number of pseudowords drawn from a particular
pair is proportional to its frequency;
? Multi-word concepts can be used as pseudoword
elements: e.g., ion-exchange chromatography
and long-term effects can be conflated as ion-
exchange chromatography long-term effects
? Only unambiguous words are used as pseudoword
constituents.
An important aspect of pseudoword creation is the rel-
ative frequencies of the underlying words. Since the stan-
dard baseline for a WSD algorithm is to always choose
the most frequent sense, a baseline that is evaluated on
words whose senses are evenly balanced will be expected
to do more poorly than one tested against words that are
heavily skewed towards one sense (Sanderson & van Ri-
jsbergen, 1999).
In naturally occurring text, the more frequent sense for
the two-sense distinction is reported to occur 92% of the
time on average; this result has been found both on the
CACM collection and on the WordNet SEMCOR sense-
tagged corpus (Sanderson & van Rijsbergen, 1999).
However, the challenge for WSD programs is to work on
the harder cases, and the artificially constructed SENSE-
VAL1 corpus has more evenly distributed senses (Gaus-
tad, 2001).
In these experiments, we explicitly compare pseu-
dowords whose underlying word frequencies are even

against those that are skewed. To generate pseudowords
with more uniform underlying distributions, we first cal-
culate the expected testing corpus frequency of those
words wi that have been unambiguously mapped to
MeSH and whose class is used in at least one pair in L. In
this collection the expected frequency was E = 45.21 with
a standard deviation of 451.19. We then built a list W of
all MeSH concepts mapped in the text that have a class
used in a pair in L and whose frequency is in the interval
[E/2;3E/2], i.e. [34;56]. This yields a list of concepts that
could potentially be combined in 64,596 pseudowords for
evaluation of the WSD algorithm performance over the
classes in L.
We then generated a random subset of 1,000 pseu-
dowords (88,758 instances) out of the possible 64,596 by
applying the following importance sampling procedure:
1) Select a category pair c1,c2 from L by sampling
from a multinomial distribution whose parameters are
proportional to the frequencies of the elements of L.
2) Sample uniformly to draw two random distinct
words w1 and w2 from W whose classes correspond to
the classes selected in step 1).
3) If the word pair w1,w2 has been sampled already, go
to step 1) and try again.
Table 2 shows a random selection of pseudowords gen-
erated by the algorithm. Note that the more unusual pair-
ings come from the less frequent category pairs, whereas
those in which word senses are closer in meaning are
drawn from more common category pairs.
4 Results
For the experiments reported below, we trained an un-
supervised Naive Bayes classifier using the categories as
both targets and as context features. For example, an oc-
currence of the word haptoglobin in the context surround-
ing the word to be disambiguated will be replaced by its
category label D12. Only unambiguous context words
were used. The result of the disambiguation step is a cat-
egory name, standing as a proxy for the word sense.

ing the most frequent sense3. Pessimistic refers to the
evenly distributed category-based pseudowords, gener-
ated by requiring the word frequency to fall in the interval
[E/2;3E/2]. In the column labeled Realistic, the require-
ment for evenly distributed senses is dropped, although
the component words must have a frequency of at least
5. The column labeled Optimistic refers to the results
when the pseudowords are generated the standard way:
the words are selected at random rather than according to
the category sets.
We expected the Realistic pseudowords to produce
a better lower-bound estimate of the performance of a
WSD algorithm on real word senses than Optimistic. To
test this hypothesis we followed a method suggested by
Liu et al (2002) and evaluated the classifier on a set of
217 two-sense abbreviations (see Table 4).
Abbreviations are real ambiguous words, but they are
also artificial in a sense. Many homonyms are similar in
meaning as well as spelling because they derive etymo-
logically from the same root. By contrast, similar spelling
in abbreviations is often simply an accident of shared ini-
tial characters in compound nouns. Thus abbreviations
occupy an intermediate position between entirely random
pseudowords and standard real ambiguous words.
We extracted 98,841 unique abbreviation-expansion
pairs4 using code developed by Schwartz & Hearst
(2003), and retained only those abbreviations whose ex-
pansions could be fully and unambiguously mapped to
a single truncated MeSH category. The different expan-
sions of each abbreviation were required to correspond

to exactly two distinct categories (with overlap allowed
when there were more than two expansions for a given
abbreviation).
The question we wanted to explore is how well does
the classifier do on category-based pseudowords versus
abbreviations. As can be seen from Table 3, the ac-
curacies for the abbreviations (evaluated on 332,020 in-
stances) fall between the Realistic and Optimistic pseu-
dowords, as expected.
5 Conclusions
We have shown that creating pseudowords based on dis-
tributions from lexical category co-occurrence can pro-
duce a more accurate lower-bound for WSD systems
that use pseudowords than the standard approach. This
method allows for the detailed study of a particular sense
ambiguity set since many different pseudowords can be
generated from one category pair. Additionally, this
method provides a better-motivated basis for the grouping
of words into pseudowords, since they more realistically
model the meaning similarity patterns of real ambiguous
words than do randomly paired words.
