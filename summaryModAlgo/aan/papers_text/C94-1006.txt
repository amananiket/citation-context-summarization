1 Introduction 
A critical issue in AI r(~sem'ch is to ov(.'r(:(ml(~ the 
knowh~(Ige acquisition bottleneck in knowl(!dge-tms(!d 
systems. As a knowledge base is eXlmn(led, adding 
more kn((wl(~dg(-` and fixing previ(ms err(m(~(Tus kn()w1-

The rest of this document is organized as ti)llows. 
We begin in Section 2 by it brief overview of the AUI'- 
J /E  Japanese-l.;nglish translation system. In Section 
3, we discuss ome of the 1)rol)lems that arise when the 
translation rules of ALT- J /E are composed manually 
})y }roman experts. Then, we t)ropose in Section 4 
an alternative approach based on machine learning 
techniques. In Section 5, we describe the inductive 
learning methods used, followed by an experimental 
ewfluation of these methods in Section 6. Fimdly, 
conclusion remarks are stated in Section 7. 
2 ALT-J/E: A Br ie f  Overv iew 
ALT-.I/E, the Automatic Language Trlmslator: 
Japanese to English, is one of the most &dvitll(:(}d 
and well-recognized systems for translating ,htpanese 
to English. It is the largest such system in terms of 
the iunount of knowledge it compris(~s. In this work, 
we are concerned with the li)llowing components o\[' 
the ALT- J /E  system: 
1. The Semantic lliera.rchy, 
2. The Semantic Dictionary, and 
3. Tile Translation l{ules. 
We briefly describe each of these COmln)nents be- 
low. For more details al)out the AI,T-.I/E sys- 
tem, we refer the reader to \[lkehara et M. 1989, 
Ikehara et al 1990, ikehara et al 1991\]. 
As shown in l"igam~ 1, the Semant ic  l t ie rarchy  
is it SOFt of colt(:el)t t}l(?SltllrtlS represented its it l;l'(?e 
structure in which each node is called a .SC'IIta'tttiC cat- 
egolw, or a (:atego'l~9 R)r siml)licity. Edges in this struc- 
ture represent "is-a" relations am(rag the categories. 
For example, "Agents" and "P(!ople" (see Figure 1) 
are both categories. Tile edge between these two (:at- 
egories indicates that any instance of "l)eoph~ '' is also 
an instance of "Agents". The current version of ALT- 
. l /E's Semlmtic llierarchy is :12 levels (let, I) and has 
about 3000 nodes. The Semant ic  D ic t ionary  maps 
(~it(:h .\]~4pall('.sC IIOtlll to  its aI)prol)riate SeIt la l l t ic  cRt- 
cgories. For example, the Selilalltic D!ctionary states 
that the noun )~!:~ (niwatori), which meahs "chicken" 
OF "h011" ill English, is an instance of the categories 
"Meat" and "Birds". 
The Trans la t ion  Ru les  in AUI?-J/E associate 
Japanese patterns with English patterns. Currently, 
ALT- J /E  uses roughly 10,000 of these rules.' As Fig- 
ure 2 shows, each translation rule has a .\]apanese fret -
tern its its left-hand side and all English pattern as 
its right-hand side. For example, the first rule in this 
figure basically sltys that if the ,Japanese verb in a 
sentence is ~J'~ < (yaku), its subj('(:t is an instance of 
"l)eople '', and its ol)ject is an instance of "lh'ead" or 
"Cake", then the following English pattern is to be 
llS(?d: 
Sub.jeer "l)ake" Obj(!ct. 
Note that in this (:~e the Japan(!se verb ~y~ ( (yaku)  
is transhtted into the English verb 'q)akc'". This slune 
.\]aI)anes(! yet'l) cait also be translated into the English 
verbs "roast", "broil", "crenmte" or "burn", depend- 
lug on the context. These (:~Lses axe }landled by the 
fore" other rules given in Figure 2. 
Translation rules are meant only to handle basic 
sentences that contain just a single .\]itl)a.ltt.'se v r}). 
Such sentences are called "simple selitellCeS. ''2 '\[l'o 
translate a comlllex sentence, M;\]'-, I/E does various 
ldnds of pre- and post-proc(~ssing, l/oughly speak- 
ing, the given complex sentence is first broken into 
a collection of simple sentences in the we-processing 
phase. Then, the English translations of these are 
combined together in the post-processing t)}u~se to 
give the final translation of the complex sentence. 
To translate a simple sentence, AI : I ' - J /E looks for 
tile most ai)I)roi)ria.te translation rule to use. Based 
on the VOl'b of the sentence, the system considers ius 
candidates all those tra.nslation rules that have this 
verb on their left-hand side. 'l'he English pattern 
of the rule, whose JaI)imese pattern matches the s0Ii- 
tell(:(! })est is th(!ii osod to generate the desired English 
translation. 
As shown in Figm'e 2, the ,Ial)anese patterns are 
exln'essed using th(, wu'iM)les NI, N~,.. . ,  etc., which 
r(!\]\[)H}s(}llt var io l lS  COIllp()lleIltS o f  it Ja, pa l lese  S(~Ilt(!llCe~

3 Shortcomings of the Manual  
Approach 
"1)ranslation rules in the AI,T-,I/I~ system have so far 
been composed manually 1)y hunmn (!xl)erts. flow- 
ever, due to the high cost-1)er-ruh.' , and b(~(:aus(~ of the 
huge nmnlmr of translation rules needed fl)r AL'I'-,\]/I); 
to carry out ;t reas()nabl(.' transhttion job, the manual 
apI)roach hms been conchided by the d(~veloI)ers of 
AUI'-J/I'~ to be impracticld. In particular, the l'(,lh)w- 
ing l)roblems have been wported: 
? lh i i ld ing and mmntaining the translation rules 
require *t greltt deal of expertise. "1"o qualify tin" 
this task, skillflfl exI~erts are required not only to 
master both aal)anese and l!;liglish, Init also t() 
b('. flflly fiuniliar with Al;I '- J / l ' ; 's large S(~lnanti(: 
l l ierarchy and to understand the overall l)l'()(:(.'ss 
of the system. Such qualifications are costly and 
involve extensive training. 
. In spite of the wmt am(rant of resourc(~s spent 
on tmilding the current ruh!s of AI2F-.III'; by hu- 
man exports, faults are still detected from time 
to tinm, Inal?ing the malnt(!ilance of th(; system 
~t ('oiltillllOliS r(~(|ll\]r(!Iil(}ilt. 
? The translaf.ion rules are not qnite coucrch: and 
vary dep(mding on the exI)ert. Rules (:onstructed 
by Oil('. oxpcl't ~-tl'(~ 11(){; (}asy for \[tiloth(H" (}XpCl'\[, t() 
understand and modify. This makes the. maintc- 
nine(! process ll)ore difficult and ii'lltkl~s it hard 
to substitute an expert by another, 
- An important o/)jective is to tmild sI)ecialized 
versions of ALq'- .} /I,; to be used in specitic al)- 
pli(:ai;ion domnins. 'l?he Illttllllltl ai)proach is o/)- 
viously unrealistic since it illvolveS Inor(! irainiug 
of the human experts with r('sp(!(:t I;() the l;arg(!f,

? One. of the problems fitting the design('rs of A1;I'- 
J/l~: is the refinement of the Smnantic lli(!rarchy. 
Whenever this structure is altered, the trans- 
lation rules mnst also t)e revised to r(qh*(:t the 
change. Such revision is extr(~mely troubh~sonu., 
and error-prone if it is don(; mamlally. 
4 A Machine Learning Ap- 
proach 
"\['lie problems we have just listed regarding the man-- 
ual construction of A\[f.\['-,l/l'\]'s translation rules are 
largely solved if the process can be automated. An 
attractive approa(:h to this l)robhmi is lto resort to 
inductive machine learning techniques to extract the 
desired translation rules fl'om examples of .laI)anesc 
sent(m(:(~s and their English translations. At tit(.' on> 
rent stage, how(wet, learning translation rules fully 
automatically from eXaml)les alone seems to lm too 
chalhmging. A more realistic goal is to minimize 
rathc'r than to totMly eliHlinat(~ the intervention of 
human exp('rts in the rifle aquisiti~m process. Thus, 
OIll" Cllrl'(?Ilt o1)jectiv(~ is to ('OllCOIltl';itt(~ 011 ~Ult.Olll~tt- 
ing l;he niost ditlicult and tinl(>(:onsnlning parts of the 
nialll lal procedure. 
The goal of the pr(!sent work is to learn what we call 
"partial translation rules". A partial translation rule 
consisls ()l" the left-hand side along with the English 
verb of the right-hand side of a translation rule. hi 
other words, the otlly diflin'en(:e between it transla.tion 
rul(.' and at partial translation ruh j is that the latter 
has only an I'\]nglish verl) rather than it full English 
patt0rn its its right-hand side. 
Constructing a partial translation rule is the most 
ditl lcult part of constructing a. tl'anslati(m rule. ln- 
d(~e(l, t;/ll'liillg it l)itrtial Fill{! into a comlil(!te one is a 
relatiw~ly easy t;ask that can Im done by a human 
operator with moderate knowh!dge of English and 
,J al)~Ul(!Se. 
5 Learning Task and Methods 
In this work, we investigate two dift'erent inductiw, 
l('arning algorithms. Before talking about these al- 
gorithms, we will first IIiMc.e the learning task more 
precise, alid shed some light Oil the diftlculties that 
distinguish it from other previously studied learning 
tasks. 
5 .1  T i le  Learn ing  Task  
The .iol) of a learning algorithm in our setting is 
to construct partial translation rules, l,'or a given 
,lapan(~s(! verb ,l-vcr'b and a l)ossil)le English transhl- 
tion l,?-vcrbi of that verb, the MgorMlm has to llnd

( ' i ) l i toxt  ill Ol 'dOr ti) Illlt 1) ,\]-'O,f~'l'l) to E-VC.'tq)i. 
As an exmnlfl(! , consider the ,lapanese verb /!E 5 
(tsukau). This verb corresponds to the English verbs 
"use", "spend" and %ml)loy". The c}loice aniong 
these IDn.t~lish verbs del)(mds mostly on tim o}@ct of 
the sentence, l,'or example, if the object is mi in- 
stance of "Asset" or "Time", then "spend" is itpl)ro- 
priate. Thus, it rough rule for mapping ?< 5 (tsukau) 
to "Slmnd" may look like 
11:" \[.l-,t.:m, = t'~5 \] 
' I ' I I I '~N l \ ] - \ ' i~Rn = spend. 
\VO S(!('I'7. to \]Oitl'll this kind of l'lll(!s frolll exatl~ll)lt!s 
of ,hil)anese senti.mces and their I:;nglish translations, 
such as the following pair:

A f ter  pars ing  (which  is carrie{l trot by A I ,T - J / Iq 's

( \[ J-\~:,u = ~5 . ~;tuuEc'r = mtj>,).

ble Person",  "Daughter"  anti "Female",  antt thosP 
for kane are "Asset",  "Metal",  " l)ay" and "M*'dal". 
Thus, this example is tiredly giwm to the learning al- 
p;tn'ithm in the folh}wing fl)rm:

Given the above definition of the binary features, 
the new pMrs (V, I '2- Verb ) in{:lude all the necessary 
l)aekgTom,d knowledge obtMn(xl form ttu., Semantic 
ltierarchy, and also reflect the ambigafity of the orig- 
imd trldning examt}les. In uther words, the above 
transformation can i}e seen as "cOral}fling" the infor- 
mation of the original ambignous training examph.'s 
along with the necessary parts of the Semantic llier- 
archy into a format that is ready to be proce~sscd 1}y 
ii)3 (or in fact, by many other feature-t}ased learning 
algorittmls). 
Note that if we create a featme fur every semantic 
category c and every sentence COmllonent Ni, then 
the total number of features will become inti.'asiblv 
large (Inany thousands), llowe.ver, what we need is 
only to consider those categories that apl}eared in the 
training data, and their ancestors (the set A above). 
In our experiments, this results in a reasomfl}le ram> 
ber of features (one to two hundred). This is 1}ecause 
the numl}er of examples is limited and also t)ecause 
of the rather "tilted" distribution of what categories 
can naturMly at}I}ear as a certain (:OlIll}Otlellt of it Sell- 
tenee for a given verb. (Eg. the object of the verl} f;2 
~3" (nomu), which roughly means to "drink", can not 
be just mlything!) 
The most important a(lvmltage of the al}ove ap- 
proach is that it cmt be applied to alnbiguous train- 
ing examl}les as they are, without the need to remove 
the mnbiguity explicitly as wc did with Ilaussler's al- 
gorithm. Another adwmtage of using ID3 is that we 
do not need to break our learning task into binary 
class learning problems ince ID3 is caI}ablc of Mu'n- 
ing multi-class learning concepts. 
6 Exper imenta l  Work  
The goad of tile experiments reI}orted here is to evalu- 
ate the qmdity of the partiad translation rules learned 
by the two h.~m'ning methods we have just descril}ed. 
The comi}arison includes the folh}wing three settings: 
1. Using llaussler's algorithm to learn fr{}ill training 
examl}les ~ffter emoving the mnl)igulty. 
2. Using ID3 to h;arn from training examl)les af- 
ter removing the ambiguity atnd performing the 
transformation given in the Subsection 5.3. 
3. Using ID3 to learn from tnfining examI}les after 
performing the transfi)rmation given ill tile Sub- 
section 5.3, trot without removing the. ambiguity. 
In a sense, the first setting rellresents the lmst we can 
do in the absence of the ambiguity since llmlssler's al- 
goritl}m does at good job in exi)loiting the baekgT{mnd 
knowledge fi-om the Selnanti{: Ilierarchy. Comparing 
Setting 2 with Setting 1 tells us how successfifl our 
transformati{m of the training examl}les is in letting 
1D3 make use of the available I}ackground knowledge. 
Fimdly, comparing Setting 3 with Settir,g 2 tells ns 
how successful our transhn'mation is in letting 1133 
learn directly froin amt)igalous training examl)les. 
The experiments were done tbr six ditl'erent 
.lapanese ver/}s. '.\['able 1 shows a list of these verbs, 
along with the II/lltl})er of training eKaul i \ ] )h!s  l l sed ,  and 
the a{:cura{:y levels obtained by each meth{}d. In the 
table, "tlausslcr", "ID3 NA" and "11)3 A" de.note 
Setting 1, Setting 2 and Setting 3, resl}e{:tively. The 
a(:curacy was esthnated using the leaLvt>olle-{}llt {:ross- 
wflidation meth{}d '| , m,d assuming that the rules {:{)m- 
I)osed rnamutlly by human experts are t}erfect (that 
is, we are measuring how close tim learned rules are 
to those {:Omllosed mmmally). 
The i)erti}rmanee l vels of both lhmssler's alg()- 
rithm and ID3 when learning from unambiguous ex- 
amples are quite similar in Sl)ite of the fact that each 
algorithm implements a different bias and has a com- 
pletely diftin'ent way {}f' exl}loiting the background 
knowledge. Coml}aring tim l}erformance of ID3 in 
the  two  cases  o f  le i l . r I l i l lg  f ro I \ [ l  itI I l \]}ig/l(}llS &ll(\[ I l lHl I \[ l -  
I)iguous examl}les , ambiguity is not harntful t(} ll)3's 
l}erforman(:e in most cases. In fact, for some of the 
verbs, the t}er for l I l~tn{:e is evelk \])etter when aml)iguity 
is present. This suggests that the apl}roach we have 
chosen to de.al with ambiguity is effective for our task, 
and tl,at ext}licit retll{}vitl o\[ ambiguity is not an at- 
tractive strategy sim:e it is not easy to {t(}, and since 
it does not greatly improve the a(:{:m'aey anyway. 
The most important ll(}int here is that the ol}served 
a{:cura{:y of both the. 11)3 a.lgorithm aim llaussler's 
algorithm is satisfactorily high overa!.l in spite of the 
limited mmfl}er of the training examl}k's used. Such 
a high level of at(:curat(:y str{mgly indicates that the 
use of these algo,'ithms will provide significant aid in 
the c{}l,struction of AI/.I'-J/E's trmMati{}\]t rules. 
7 Conc lus ion  
This paper reported our work towaMs the acquisi- 
ti(m of,hqmnese-lCmglish translation rules through the 
use of inductive machine learning techniques. Two 
approaches were investigated. The first aplmmch ix 
based on a. theoreticMly-f(mnded algorithm given by 
l lmlssler fl}r h~arning internal disjunctive eoncel)tS. 
This algorithm haLs the advantage that it is tailored to 
utilize background knowledge, of the kind availabh~ in 
our domain. We f{nmd, howeww, no obvious way to 
make this algorithm learn directly t'mm ambignous 
training examples, and thus, anlbiguity wlm explic-. 
itly removed from the training exmnph~s in order to 
use this algorithm. Om' second apl)roach ix based on 
the IDa algorithm. As it is, i1)3 is not Mile to uti- 
lize the background knowledge of our domain, nor is 
it capable of dealing with ambiguous training exam-
