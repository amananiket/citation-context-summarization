This paper describes the implementation f a 
prototype of a grammar based grammar checker for 
Czech and the basic ideas behind this implementation. 
The demo is implemented asan independent program 
cooperating with Microsoft Word. The grammar 
checker uses specialized grammar formalism which 
generally enables to check errors in languages with a 
very high degree of word order freedom. 
Introduction 
Automatic grammar checking is one of the fields 
of natural anguage processing where simple means do 
not provide satisfactory results. This statement is even 
more true with respect to grammar checking of the 
so-called free word order languages. With the growing 
degree of word order freedom the usability of simple 
pattern matching techniques decreases. In languages 
with such a high degree of word order freedom as in 
most Slavic languages the set of syntactic errors that 
may be detected by means of simple pattern matching 
methods is almost negligible. This is probably one of 
the reasons, why even though the famous paper \[CH83\] 
was written as long as 13 years ago, there are still very 
few articles about his topic, except papers like \[K94\] or 
\[M96\] which appeared only during the last three years. 
In the present paper we describe the basic ideas 
behind an implementation f a prototype of a grammar 
checker for Czech. During the development of this 
application we had to solve a number of problems 
concerning the theoretical background, to develop a
formalism allowing efficient implementation a d of 
course to create a grammar and define the structure of 
the lexical data. The last but not least problem was to 
incorporate the prototype into an existing text editor. 
How does the system work 
In order to demonstrate he function of the pivot 
implementation f our system we decided to connect it 
to a commercially available text editor. We intended to 
create a DLL library with the standard grammar 
checking interface required by a particular text editor. 
This idea turned out to be unrealistic because the 
necessary interface is among the classified inside 
information in most companies. Fortunately there is the 
possibility to use a concept of Dynamic Data Exchange 
(DDE) for the communication between programs in the 
Microsoft Windows environment. This type of 
connection is of course much slower than the intended 
one, but for the purpose of this demonstration the 
difference in speed is not so important. 
Our system can work with any text editor under 
Windows that contains a macro language supporting the 
DDE connection. For the purpose of the pivot 
implementation f the system we have chosen Microsoft 
Word 6.0. The grammar checker is implemented as an 
independent Windows application (GRAMMAR.EXE) 
which runs on the background of the Word. In order to 
be able to use GRAMMAR.EXE, we had to create a 
macro Grammar, assigned to the Grammar Checker 
item in the Tools menu. This macro selects a current 
sentence, sends it to GRAMMAR.EXE via DDE, 
receives the result and indicates the type of the result o 
the user. This activity is being performed for all 
sentences in the selection or for all sentences from the 
position of the cursor till the end of document.

The user may get several types of messages 
about he correctness of  the text: 
a) The macro changes the color of  words in the text 
according to the type of the detected error - the 
unknown words are marked blue, the pairs of words 
involved in a syntactic error are marked red. 
b) The macro creates a message box with a warning 
each time there is an undesired result of  grammar 
checking - -  either there was no result or the 
sentence was too complicated. 
c) In case that the grammar checker identified and 
localized an error, it creates a message box with a 
short description of  the error(s). 
Because the grammar checker is running as an 
independent application, the user may also look at the 
complete results provided by it. When a message box 
containing an error message appears on the screen, the 
user may switch to GRAMMAR and get an additional 
information. The main window of  GRAMMAR is able 
to provide either the complete list of  errors, the statistics 
concerning for example the number of  different 
syntactic trees built during grammar checking or even 
the result in the form of a syntactic tree. We do not 
suppose that the last option is interesting for a typical 
user, but if we do have all this information, why should 
we throw it out?

The architecture of the system 
The design of  the whole system is shown in the 
Fig. I. The grammar checker is composed basically of  
three parts: 
I.Morphological and lexical analysis 
This part is in fact an extended spelling checker. 
The input text is first checked for spelling errors, then 
the lexical and morphological nalysis creates data, 
which are combined with the information contained in a 
separate syntactic dictionary. It would of  course be 
possible to use only one dictionary containing 
morphosyntactic information about particular words 
(lemmas), but for the sake of an easier update of 
information during the development of  the system we 
have decided to keep morphemic and syntactic data in 
separate files.

2.Grammar checking (extended variant of syntactic 
parsing) 
This is the main part of  the system. It tries to 
analyze the input sentence. There are three possible 
results of  the analysis: 
a) The analysis is successful and no syntactic 
inconsistencies were found (at this stage of 
processing it is too early to use the term syntactic 
error, because in our terminology the term error is 
reserved for something what is being announced to 
the user after the evaluation) - -  in this case the 
sentence is considered to be correct and no message 
is issued. 
b) The analysis is successful, but all results contain at 
least one syntactic inconsistency. In this case it is 
necessary to pass the results to the evaluation phase. 
c) The analysis fails and (probably for the reason of the 
incompleteness of the grammar) it cannot say 
anything about he input sentence. In such a case no 
error message is issued. We do not use any partial 
results for the evaluation of  the possible source of an 
error. Partial results are misleading, because it is 
often the case that the error is buried somewhere 
inside the partial tree and tlo operations performed 
on partial trees can provide a correct error message. 
Besides that operations on (hundreds or thousands) 
148 
partial trees are very ineffective and they can also 
slow down substantially the processing of  the given 
sentence. 
3.Evaluation 
This phase takes the results of the previous phase 
in the form of syntactic trees containing markers 
describing individual syntactic inconsistencies. It tries 
to locate the source of  the error using an algorithm that 
compares available trees. According to the settings 
given by the user the evaluation phase issues warnings 
or error messages. 
The core of the system is the second, grammar 
checking phase, therefore we will concentrate on the 
description of that phase. 
Process of grammar checking 
The design of  our system was motivated by 
a simple and natural idea - -  the grammar checker 
should not spend too much time on simple correct 
sentences. The composition of  a grammar checking 
module tries to stick to this idea as much as possible. 
The processing of  an input sentence is divided into 
three phases: 
a) Positive projective 
This phase is in fact a standard parser - -  it 
checks if it is possible to represent a given input 
sentence by means of  a projective syntactic tree not 
containing any negative symbol (these symbols 
represent the application of a grammar rule with relaxed 
constraints or an error anticipating rule). If the answer is 
positive, the sentence is considered to be correct and no 
error message is issued. 
As an example we may take the following simple 
sentence: "Karlova ~ena zal6vala kv~tiny." (Word for 
word translation: Charles'\[fern.sing\] wifewatered 
therefore its processing ends here. The system 
recognizes the structure of this sentence in the following 
way: 
LIEFT $ lENT I NEL 
ZALEUALA 
I<UET I NV " ,  / /  
KARL I~IA  
b) Positive nonprojective & negative projective 
This phase tries to find a syntactic tree which 
either contains negative symbols or nonprojective 
constructions. A nonprojective subtree is a subtree with 
discontinuous coverage. It is often the case - -  for 
example in wh-sentences - -  that the sentence may be 
considered either syntactically incorrect or 
nonprojective - - see  examples in \[COL94\]. if such a 
syntactic tree exists, the evaluation phase tries to decide 
if there should be an error message, warning or nothing. 
Let us present a slightly modified sentence from 
the previous paragraph: "Karlovy ~ena zal6vala 
kv~tiny." (Word for word translation: Charles'\[fem.pl.\] 
wife watered flowers). This sentence is ambiguous, it is 
either correct and nonprojective (meaning: Woman 
watered Charles' flowers) or incorrect (disagreement in 
number between "Karlovy" and "~ena") and projective. 
Both results are achieved by this phase of  the grammar 
checker:

c) Negative nonprojective 
Both nonprojective constructions and negative 
symbols are allowed. If this phase succeeds, the 
evaluation module issues a relevant error message or 
warning. In case that neither phase provides any result, 
no error message is issued. In case that the user wants to 
know which sentences were not analyzed properly, s/he 
may obtain a warning. 
149 
Although this division into phases worked fine 
for short sentences (for the sentences not more than 
15 words long the first phase usually took about 
1 second on Pentium 75 MHz), long and complicated 
sentences were unacceptably slow (even tens of 
seconds). These results turned our attention to the 
problem how to speed up the processing of correct 
sentences even further. 
With the growing length of sentences the parsing 
will be more complex with respect both to the length of 
the processing and to the number of resulting syntactic 
structures. Let us demonstrate he problem on a sample 
sentence from the corpus of Czech newspaper texts 
from the newspaper Lidov~ noviny. Let us take the 
sentence: 
"KDS nep~edpokhidfi spoluprfici se stranou pana 
Sladka a neni pravdou, ~.e ptedseda k~est'ansk37ch 
demokratfi pan Benda v telefonick6m rozhovoru s 
Petrem Pithartem prosazoval ing. Dejmala do funkce 
ministra ~ivotniho prost~edi." 
(Word for word translation: "CDP \[does\] not 
suppose cooperation with party \[of\] Mister Slfidek and 
\[it\] isn't true, that chairman \[of\] Christian democrats 
Mister Benda in telephone discussion with Petr Pithart 
enforced ing. Dejmal to function \[of\] minister \[of\] 
environment.") 
In this basic form of the sentence, which is an 
exact ranscription of the text from the corpus, the 
processing by the positive projective phase of our 
parser takes 13,07s and it provides 26 different variants 
of syntactic trees. During the processing there were 
2272 items derived. The testing of this sentence and 
also of all the following ones was performed on 
Pentium 75MHz with 16MB RAM. 
Such a relatively large number of variants is 
caused by the fact that our syntactic analysis uses only 
purely syntactic means - we do not take into account 
either semantics or textual or sentential context. That is 
the reason why free modifiers at the end of our sample 
sentence create a great number of variants of syntactic 
structures and thus make the processing longer and 
more complicated. In order to demonstrate his problem 
we will take this sentence and modify it trying to find 
out what the main source of ineffectiveness of its 
parsing is. 
If we look more closely at the number of 
ambiguities present with individual words, we notice 
that the most ambiguous word is the word 
(abbreviation) "ing." This word form is the same in all 
cases, genders and numbers. If we substitute this 
abbreviation by the full form of the word ("in~en~,ra" 
\[engineer - \[gem\]\]) weget the following results: the 
sentence is processed 8,95s, the number of variants 
decreases by four (22) and the number of derived items 
is, of course, also smaller (I 817). The gain of speed 
would be even greater would we have worked with a 
negative or a nonprojective variant of the parser. 
The next step is to delete further groups of words 
from the input sentence. Among the suitable candidates 
there is, for example, the prepositional phrase "v 
telefonickEm rozhovoru" (in \[the\] telephone 
discussion). This phrase can be easily checked for 
grammatical correctness locally, because it has a clear 
leR and right borders (prepositions "v"and "s"). Here 
we can easily solve the problem where the nominal 
group ends on the right hand side. in general, we need 
to parse the whole sentence in order to get this 
information, but in some specific cases we can rely only 
on the surface word order. 
After we had deleted this phrase, the processing 
time went down to 8,79s, the same number of syntactic 
representations as in the previous case was derived (22) 
and the number of items was slightly lower (1789). This 
phrase is therefore certainly not the main source of 
ineffectiveness in parsing. In order to speed up the 
processing even more we have to use another type of 
simplification. 
The first step of simplifying the original input 
sentence represented almost 50% acceleration although 
it was only a cosmetic hange from an abbreviation toa 
full word form. From the point of view of Iocalisation of 
grammatical inconsistencies we can proceed even 
farther - the group title+surname in fact represents only 
one item; if we remove titles preceding surnames we do 
not change syntactic structure of the sentence. It is 
locally only a tiny bit simpler. When we look more 
closely at the resulting syntactic representation f the 
previous variants of the input sentence we may notice 
that the word "in~en3~ra" \[engineer\[gen.\]\] figures 
(inadequately, of course, in this case) also as a right- 
hand attribute to the word "Pithartem\[instr.\]", as it is 
shown in the following screenshots (for the sake of 
simplicity we demonstrate only the relevant part of 
derivation trees ).

Let us remove the word "in~en~,ra" from the 
input sentence altogether. This time the processing time 
is only 3,74s, only 10 structures are created and 1021 
items are derived. Another logical step is to remove all 
other first names and titles which are placed 
immediately in front of their governing words. Those 
words are "pana" \[mister \[gen.\]\], "pan" and "Petrem". 
The claim that the first two words are unambiguous i  
supported by the fact that the form of the word "p~in" 
\[mister\] is different in Czech in case the word is 
"independent" and in case it is used as a title (p~na vs. 
pana \[gen.,acc.\], pzin vs. pan\[nom.\]). When we make 
this change we get more than 50% shorter processing 
time, namely 1,71 s, also the number of resulting 
structures i a half of the original number (5) and only 
587 items are derived. Another change we would like to 
demonstrate is the deletion of all other free modifiers 
the result of which is a certain "backbone" of the 
sentence. 
After having carried out all deletions, we arrive 
at the following structure: 
"KDS nepfedpokl~id~i spolupr~ici a neni pravdou, 
~e Benda prosadil Dejmala." 
(Word for word translation: "CDP \[does\] not- 
suppose cooperation and \[it\] isn't true, that Benda 
enforced Dejmal.") 
The result of the processing is a unique structure 
and 141 items are derived in 0,22s. The last variant of 
the input sentence will serve as a contrast to the 
previous ones. Let us take the last clause of the 
sentence, namely 
"P~edseda kPest'anskych demokratO pan Benda v 
telefonick6m rozhovoru s Petrem Pithartem prosazoval 
in~en~ra Dejmala do funkce ministra ~.ivotniho 
prost~edi." 
\["Chairman \[of\] Christian democrats Mister 
Benda in telephone discussion with Petr Pithart 
enforced ing. Dejmal to function \[of\] minister \[of\] 
environment."). 
If we take into account he results of the previous 
examples we should not be surprised by the results. The 
processing time is 2,25s, I 0 structures were created and 
722 items were derived. 
This example and also other test data showed 
that the main source of ineffectivity are clauses with a 
big number of free modifiers and adjuncts rather than 
complex sentences with many clauses. These results 
have led us to a layered esign of grammar for positive 
projective parsing. The core idea of this approach is the 
following: 
Syntactic onstructions which even in free word 
order languages may be parsed locally (certain 
adjectival or prepositional phrases etc.) should be 
parsed first in order to avoid their mutual unnecessary 
(from the point of view of grammar checking!) 
combinations. This means that the grammar should be 
divided into certain layers of rules (not necessarily 
disjunctive), which will be applied one atter the other 
(in principle they may be applied even in cycles, but 
this options is not used in our implementation). 
In the pivot version of our system we use the 
following layers: 
I st layer: a metarule for processing titles and 
abbreviations preceding names 
2nd layer: a metarule from the first layer together with 
metarules for processing prepositional nd 
adjectival phrases 
3rd layer: metarules from the previous layer together 
with metarules filling the valency slots and other 
metarules on the level of one clause 
4th layer: metarules from the previous layer together 
with those processing of complex sentences 
5th layer: metarules for processing the left sentinel and 
the right hand side sentential border 
The application of layers may slow down the 
processing of short sentences (it has a fixed cost of 
opening the description file and consulting it during 
parsing process), therefore it is applied only to 
151 
sentences longer than certain threshold (currently 15 
words). 
Another important point is, that the results of 
parsing in layers provides only positive information (i.e. 
it is able to sort out sentences which are certainly 
correct, but the failure of parsing in layers does not 
necessarily mean that the sentence is incorrect). The 
same approach may not be used for error localization 
and identification, although the cases when parsing in 
layers fails on a correct sentence are quite rare. 
The imp lementat ion  
The implementation of our system was to a big 
extent influenced by the demand of effectiveness. For 
this reason we had to abandon even feature structures as 
the form of  the representation of  lexical data. Our data 
structure is a set of attribute-value pairs with the data 
about valency frames of particular words as the only 
complex values (embedded attribute-value pairs). 
An example of the representation f the Czech 
wordform "informoval" (\[he\] informed) follows: 
i n fo rmova l  
lex f :  in fo rmovat  
wc l :  vb  
syntc l :  v 
v c l :  fu l l  
re f l :  0

\ ] )  
neg :  no  
v fo rm:  pastp  
gender :  ? inan  , an im t 
num:  sg  
END 
\] 
z3e  
The grammar of the system is composed of 
metarules representing whole sets of rules of the 
background formalism called Robust Free Order 
Dependency Grammar (RFODG). The limited space of 
this paper does not allow to present the full description 
of RFODG here. The definition may be found for 
example in \[TR96\]. 
The RFODG provides a formal base for the 
description ofnonprojective and incorrect syntactic 
constructions. It introduces three measures by means of 
which it is possible to classify the degree of 
nonprojectivness and incorrectness of a particular 
sentence. In this paper we would like to stress one 
important feature of this formalism, namely the 
classification of the set of symbols which are used by 
RFODG into three types: 
a) terminals and nonterminals 
b) deletable and nondeletable symbols 
c) positive and negative symbols 
The sets under a) have the usual meaning, the 
sets under b) serve for the classification of syntactic 
inconsistencies and the sets under c) serve for their 
Iocalisation. The union of terminals and nonterminals i  
exactly the set of all symbols used by RFODG. The 
same holds about he union of deletable and 
nondeletable symbols and also about he union of 
positive and negative symbols. In other words, each 
symbol used by RFODG belongs to exactly one set 
from each pair of sets under a), b) and c). 
This classification therefore allows to handle 
ru!es describing both correct and erroneous syntactic 
constructions in a uniform way and to use a single 
grammar for the description of both types of syntactic 
constructions. Whenever a metarule describing syntactic 
inconsistency is used during the parsing process, a
negative symbol is inserted into the tree created 
according to the grammar. 
The metarules express a procedural description 
of the process of checking the applicability of a given 
metarule to a particular pair of input items A and B (A 
stands to the left from B i n the input). In case that a 
particular rule may be applied to items A and B, a new 
item X is created. It is possible to change values of the 
resulting item X by means of an assignment operator := 
? The constraint relaxation technique is implemented in 
the form of so called "soft constraints" - the constraints 
with an operator ? accompanied by an error marker may 
be relaxed in phases b) and c) ("hard constraints" with 
an operator = may never be relaxed). 
The error anticipating rules are marked by a 
keyword NEGATIVE at the beginning of the rule and 
are applied only in phases b) and c). The keyword 
PROJECTIVE indicates that the rule may be applied 
only in a projective way. 
An example of a (simplified) metarule desc,'ibing 
the attachment of a nominal modifier in genitive case 
from the right hand side of the noun: 
PROJECT IVE  
IF  A .SYNTCL  = n THEN ELSE  
IF  A .SYNTCL  = prep2  
FA IL  ENDIF  
ENDIF  
B .SYNTCL  = n 
B .case  = gen  
A .R IGHTGEN = yes  
IF  A .T ITUL  : yes  THEN 
THEN ELSE

THEN 
THEN 
IF  A .CASE = gen THEN 
IF  A .GENDER = B.GENDER 
IF  A .NUM : B .NUM 
FA IL  ELSE  ENDIF  
ELSE  ENDIF  
ELSE  ENDIF  
ELSE  ENDIF  
X : :A  
X .R IGHTGEN := no  
OK 
END P 
The interpretation of the grammar is performed 
by means of  a slightly modified CYK algorithm (a 
description of this algorithm may be found for example 
in \[$97\]. The grammar works with unambiguous input 
data (ambiguous words are represented as sets of 
unambiguous items). All partial parses from the first 
phase are used in the phases b) and c). For the purpose 
of testing and debugging the system we use full parsing 
even in the first phase. 
Speeding up the  per fo rmance  
It is often the case that nondeterministic parsers 
the author of the grammar has to prevent an unnecessary 
multiplication of  results by means of"tricks" which are 
not supported by the linguistic theory - -  let us take for 
example the problem of subject - -  predicate - -  object 
construction. If we do not put any additional restriction 
on the order of application of  rules then the rule filling 
the subcategorization slots for subject and object may 
be applied in two ways, either first filling the slot for the 
subject and then the object or vice versa. Both ways 
create the same syntactic structure. 
In such a case it is necessary to apply some 
additional constraints in the grammar - -  for example 
the restriction on the order of subcategorization (an item 
to the left of  a verb should be processed first). This 
approach makes the grammar more complicated than it 
is necessary and it may also influence the quality of  
results (an error on the left hand side of  a verb may also 
prevent an attachment of the items fi'om the right hand 
side of the verb). 
The interpreter of our grammar solves these 
situations itself. Every time a new item is created, the 
interpreter checks, if such an item with the same 
structure and coverage already exists. If yes, the new 
item is deleted. 
This property of  the interpreter is used together 
with other kinds of  pruning techniques in all phases of 
grammar checking. In addition, there are also some 
other techniques used especially in phases b) and c). 
The work with unambiguous input symbols allows fast 
parsing in the phase a) (CYK is polynomial with respect 
to the length of  the input), but creates ome problems in 
the context of  constraint relaxations used in subsequent 
phases. For example, a typical error in "free word 
order'' languages i an error in agreement. Let us 
suppose that we have the following three input words 
(the actual exical value of  these words may be 
neglected): 
Preposition (accusative or locative) Adjective 
(animate or inanimate gender, genitive or accusative 
sing.) Noun (animate, genitive or accusative sing.) 
These words represent 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 
unambiguous items. If we try to create a prepositional 
phrase without constraint relaxation, we get one 
resulting item PP(animate, accusative sing.). On the 
other hand after the relaxation of  constraints there are 
16 items created. One of them does not contain any 
syntactic inconsistency, remaining 15 has one or two 
syntactic inconsistencies. In a nondeterministic parser 
all 16 variants are used in the subsequent parsing. This 
causes a combinatorial explosion of mostly incorrect 
results. 
There are two ways how to solve this problem. 
The first possible solution is to relax the constraints in 
certain order (to apply a hierarchy on constraints). We 
have chosen the other possible way, which prefers the 
subtrees with minimal number of errors. Every time a 
new branch or subtree is created, it is compared with the 
other branches or subtrees with the same structure and 
coverage and if it contains more errors than those 
already existing, it is not parsed further. 
This technique substantially speeds up the 
processing of  rules with relaxed constraints, but it has 
also one rather unpleasant side effect: the syntactic 
inconsistencies may be suppressed and appear later in a 
different location. This makes the task of  the evaluating 
part of  our system a bit more difficult, but nevertheless 
the gain on effectivity not accompanied by the loss of 
recall justifies the use of this technique. 
Conclusion 
The main purpose of the demo of our system is 
to demonstrate a method of grammar based grammar 
checking of a "free word order" language. The system is 
far from being ready for commercial exploitation - the 
main obstacle is the size of  the syntactic dictionary 
used. Grammar based methods require a complex 
syntactic information about words. To build a syntactic 
dictionary of about 150 000 items is a task which 
exceeds our current capacities with respect both to 
manpower and funds. It would be interesting to continue 
the work on our system towards the development of
