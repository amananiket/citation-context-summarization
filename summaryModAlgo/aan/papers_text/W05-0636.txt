Abstract
A striking feature of human syntactic pro-
cessing is that it is context-dependent, that
is, it seems to take into account seman-
tic information from the discourse con-
text and world knowledge. In this paper,
we attempt to use this insight to bridge
the gap between SRL results from gold
parses and from automatically-generated
parses. To do this, we jointly perform
parsing and semantic role labeling, using
a probabilistic SRL system to rerank the
results of a probabilistic parser. Our cur-
rent results are negative, because a locally-
trained SRL model can return inaccurate
probability estimates.
1 Introduction
Although much effort has gone into developing
statistical parsing models and they have improved
steadily over the years, in many applications that
use parse trees errors made by the parser are a ma-
jor source of errors in the final output. A promising
approach to this problem is to perform both pars-
ing and the higher-level task in a single, joint prob-
abilistic model. This not only allows uncertainty
about the parser output to be carried upward, such
as through an k-best list, but also allows informa-
tion from higher-level processing to improve pars-
ing. For example, Miller et al (2000) showed that
performing parsing and information extraction in a
joint model improves performance on both tasks. In
particular, one suspects that attachment decisions,
which are both notoriously hard and extremely im-
portant for semantic analysis, could benefit greatly
from input from higher-level semantic analysis.
The recent interest in semantic role labeling pro-
vides an opportunity to explore how higher-level se-
mantic information can inform syntactic parsing. In
previous work, it has been shown that SRL systems
that use full parse information perform better than
those that use shallow parse information, but that
machine-generated parses still perform much worse
than human-corrected gold parses.
The goal of this investigation is to narrow the gap
between SRL results from gold parses and from au-
tomatic parses. We aim to do this by jointly perform-
ing parsing and semantic role labeling in a single
probabilistic model. In both parsing and SRL, state-
of-the-art systems are probabilistic; therefore, their
predictions can be combined in a principled way by
multiplying probabilities. In this paper, we rerank
the k-best parse trees from a probabilistic parser us-
ing an SRL system. We compare two reranking ap-
proaches, one that linearly weights the log proba-
bilities, and the other that learns a reranker over
parse trees and SRL frames in the manner of Collins
(2000).
Currently, neither method performs better than
simply selecting the top predicted parse tree. We
discuss some of the reasons for this; one reason be-
ing that the ranking over parse trees induced by the
semantic role labeling score is unreliable, because
the model is trained locally.
2 Base SRL System
Our approach to joint parsing and SRL begins with
a base SRL system, which uses a standard architec-
ture from the literature. Our base SRL system is a
cascade of maximum-entropy classifiers which se-
lect the semantic argument label for each constituent
of a full parse tree. As in other systems, we use
three stages: pruning, identification, and classifica-
tion. First, in pruning, we use a deterministic pre-
processing procedure introduced by Xue and Palmer
(2004) to prune many constituents which are almost
certainly not arguments. Second, in identification,
a binary MaxEnt classifier is used to prune remain-
ing constituents which are predicted to be null with

high probability. Finally, in classification, a multi-
class MaxEnt classifier is used to predict the argu-
ment type of the remaining constituents. This clas-
sifer also has the option to output NULL.
It can happen that the returned semantic argu-
ments overlap, because the local classifiers take no
global constraints into account. This is undesirable,
because no overlaps occur in the gold semantic an-
notations. We resolve overlaps using a simple recur-
sive algorithm. For each parent node that overlaps
with one of its descendents, we check which pre-
dicted probability is greater: that the parent has its
locally-predicted argument label and all its descen-
dants are null, or that the descendants have their op-
timal labeling, and the parent is null. This algorithm
returns the non-overlapping assignment with glob-
ally highest confidence. Overlaps are uncommon,
however; they occurred only 68 times on the 1346
sentences in the development set.
We train the classifiers on PropBank sections 02?
21. If a true semantic argument fails to match
any bracketing in the parse tree, then it is ignored.
Both the identification and classification models are
trained using gold parse trees. All of our features are
standard features for this task that have been used
in previous work, and are listed in Tables 1 and 2.
We use the maximum-entropy implementation in the
Mallet toolkit (McCallum, 2002) with a Gaussian
prior on parameters.
3 Reranking Parse Trees Using SRL
Information
Here we give the general framework for the rerank-
ing methods that we present in the next section. We
write a joint probability model over semantic frames
F and parse trees t given a sentence x as
p(F, t|x) = p(F |t,x)p(t|x), (1)
where p(t|x) is given by a standard probabilistic
parsing model, and p(F |t,x) is given by the base-
line SRL model described previously.

In this paper, we choose (F ?, t?) to approximately
maximize the probability p(F, t|x) using a reranking
approach. To do the reranking, we generate a list of
k-best parse trees for a sentence, and for each pre-
dicted tree, we predict the best frame using the base
SRL model. This results in a list {(F i, ti)} of parse
tree / SRL frame pairs, from which the reranker
chooses. Thus, our different reranking methods vary
only in which parse tree is selected; given a parse
tree, the frame is always chosen using the best pre-
diction from the base model.
The k-best list of parses is generated using Dan
Bikel?s (2004) implementation of Michael Collins?
parsing model. The parser is trained on sections 2?
21 of the WSJ Treebank, which does not overlap
with the development or test sets. The k-best list is
generated in Bikel?s implementation by essentially
turning off dynamic programming and doing very
aggressive beam search. We gather a maximum of
500 best parses, but the limit is not usually reached
using feasible beam widths. The mean number of
parses per sentence is 176.
4 Results and Discussion
In this section we present results on several rerank-
ing methods for joint parsing and semantic role la-
226
beling. Table 3 compares F1 on the development set
of our different reranking methods. The first four
rows in Table 3 are baseline systems. We present
baselines using gold trees (row 1 in Table 3) and
predicted trees (row 2). As shown in previous work,
gold trees perform much better than predicted trees.
We also report two cheating baselines to explore
the maximum possible performance of a reranking
system. First, we report SRL performance of ceil-
ing parse trees (row 3), i.e., if the parse tree from the
k-best list is chosen to be closest to the gold tree.
This is the best expected performance of a parse
reranking approach that maximizes parse F1. Sec-
ond, we report SRL performance where the parse
tree is selected to maximize SRL F1, computing
using the gold frame (row 4). There is a signifi-
cant gap both between parse-F1-reranked trees and
SRL-F1-reranked trees, which shows promise for
joint reranking. However, the gap between SRL-
F1-reranked trees and gold parse trees indicates that
reranking of parse lists cannot by itself completely
close the gap in SRL performance between gold and
predicted parse trees.
4.1 Reranking based on score combination
Equation 1 suggests a straightforward method for
reranking: simply pick the parse tree from the k-best
list that maximizes p(F, t|x), in other words, add the
log probabilities from the parser and the base SRL
system. More generally, we consider weighting the
individual probabilities as
s(F, t) = p(F |t,x)1??p(t|x)?. (2)
Such a weighted combination is often used in the
speech community to combine acoustic and lan-
guage models.
This reranking method performs poorly, however.
No choice of ? performs better than ? = 1, i.e.,
choosing the 1-best predicted parse tree. Indeed, the
more weight given to the SRL score, the worse the
combined system performs. The problem is that of-
ten a bad parse tree has many nodes which are obvi-
ously not constituents: thus p(F |t,x) for such a bad
tree is very high, and therefore not reliable. As more
weight is given to the SRL score, the unlabeled re-
call drops, from 55% when ? = 0 to 71% when
? = 1. Most of the decrease in F1 is due to the drop
in unlabeled recall.
4.2 Training a reranker using global features
One potential solution to this problem is to add
features of the entire frame, for example, to vote
against predicted frames that are missing key argu-
ments. But such features depend globally on the en-
tire frame, and cannot be represented by local clas-
sifiers. One way to train these global features is to
learn a linear classifier that selects a parse / frame
pair from the ranked list, in the manner of Collins
(2000). Reranking has previously been applied to
semantic role labeling by Toutanova et al (2005),
from which we use several features. The difference
between this paper and Toutanova et al is that in-
stead of reranking k-best SRL frames of a single
parse tree, we are reranking 1-best SRL frames from
the k-best parse trees.
Because of the the computational expense of
training on k-best parse tree lists for each of 30,000
sentences, we train the reranker only on sections 15?
18 of the Treebank (the same subset used in previ-
ous CoNLL competitions). We train the reranker
using LogLoss, rather than the boosting loss used
by Collins. We also restrict the reranker to consider
only the top 25 parse trees.
This globally-trained reranker uses all of the fea-
tures from the local model, and the following global
features: (a) sequence features, i.e., the linear se-
quence of argument labels in the sentence (e.g.
A0_V_A1), (b) the log probability of the parse tree,
(c) has-arg features, that is, for each argument type
a binary feature indicating whether it appears in the
frame, (d) the conjunction of the predicate and has-
arg feature, and (e) the number of nodes in the tree
classified as each argument type.
The results of this system on the development set
are given in Table 3 (row 6). Although this performs
better than the score combination method, it is still
no better than simply taking the 1-best parse tree.
This may be due to the limited training set we used
in the reranking model. A base SRL model trained
only on sections 15?18 has 61.26 F1, so in com-
parison, reranking provides a modest improvement.
This system is the one that we submitted as our offi-
cial submission. The results on the test sets are given
in Table 4.
5 Summing over parse trees
In this section, we sketch a different approach to
joint SRL and parsing that does not use rerank-
ing at all. Maximizing over parse trees can mean
that poor parse trees can be selected if their se-
mantic labeling has an erroneously high score. But
we are not actually interested in selecting a good
parse tree; all we want is a good semantic frame.
This means that we should select the semantic frame

that maximizes the posterior probability: p(F |x) =
?
t p(F |t,x)p(t|x). That is, we should be sum-
ming over the parse trees instead of maximizing over
them. The practical advantage of this approach is
that even if one seemingly-good parse tree does not
have a constituent for a semantic argument, many
other parse trees in the k-best list might, and all
are considered when computing F ?. Also, no sin-
gle parse tree need have constituents for all of F ?;
because it sums over all parse trees, it can mix and
match constituents between different trees. The op-
timal frame F ? can be computed by an O(N3) pars-
ing algorithm if appropriate independence assump-
tions are made on p(F |x). This requires designing
an SRL model that is independent of the bracketing
derived from any particular parse tree. Initial experi-
ments performed poorly because the marginal model
p(F |x) was inadequate. Detailed exploration is left
for future work.
6 Conclusion and Related Work
In this paper, we have considered several methods
for reranking parse trees using information from se-
mantic role labeling. So far, we have not been
able to show improvement over selecting the 1-best
parse tree. Gildea and Jurafsky (Gildea and Jurafsky,
2002) also report results on reranking parses using
an SRL system, with negative results. In this paper,
we confirm these results with a MaxEnt-trained SRL
model, and we extend them to show that weighting
the probabilities does not help either.
Our results with Collins-style reranking are too
preliminary to draw definite conclusions, but the po-
tential improvement does not appear to be great. In
future work, we will explore the max-sum approach,
which has promise to avoid the pitfalls of max-max
reranking approaches.
