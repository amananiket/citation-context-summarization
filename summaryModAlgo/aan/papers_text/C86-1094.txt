APE is a workbench to develop ATN grammars based on an active chart parser. 
It represents he networks graphically and supports the grammar writer by win- 
(tow- and menu-based debugging techniques. 
1. ATNs - Attractive, but .... 
Augmented Transition Network Grammars are one of 
the frameworks for developing natural anguage par- 
sers that has been used sueessfully in a large number of 
natural anguage systems for many languages since its 
introduction i the early seventies by Woods \[WOO 701. 
Three aspects of ATNs, namely applicability in various 
types of natural anguage systems, suitability for dif- 
ferent languages and the availability of efficient proces- 
sing methods make ATNs an adequate framework for 
practically oriented development of natural language 
parsers. 
Since the time of its introduction the core of the ATN 
formalism has proved to be astonishingly stable and the 
exposition and specification ofATNs given in \[BAT 78\] 
turned out to become a quasi-standard. 
One of the five claims stated there, namely perspicuity, 
deserves ome comments, because to us it doesn't seem 
justified strongly. On the contrary we feel that con- 
cerning perspicuity and descriptiveness ATN grammars 
do have some shortcomings. These come into play if you 
use the ATN formalism to develop a grammar for a non- 
trivial subset of a natural language. 
The main reason for this insufficient perspicuity clearly 
lies in the possiblities ATNs offer with respect o local 
and global register setting and testing. These facilities, 
though practically very useful, give an ATN grammar a
somewhat procedural character, the grammar writer has 
to cope with. In this sense ATNs can be seen as a 
programming language for writing nondeterministic 
programs (grammars). Thus for the development of any 
larger grammars (programs) some sort of programming 
environment for ATNs not only is necessary but also 
compensates the lack of perspicuity and it makes the 
development of ATN grammars a practicable task. 
2. Design Considerat ions for an ATN Env i ronment  
Examining various ATN environments a \[KEH 80\], 
\[GNE 82\] and \[CHR 831 for example we developed our 
ATN programming environment (APE) along following 
design principles. 
1) The various tools the environment offers must be in- 
tegrated allowing simultaneous grammar editing and 
testing. 
2) The grarmnar editor has to represent the network 
structures graphically allowing the user to access the 
grammar via the contextfree skeleton of the various 
networks. 
3) The desigu of the system should make use of techni- 
ques like multi-windowing, menue- and mouse-based 
interaction facilities, in order to make the system 
usable in an easy manner. 
With this desiderata concerning the design of such a 
system, certain requirements concerning the hardware 
and software fi)r such an implementation are necessary. 
We have chosen Interlisp-D (Trademark of XEROX) as 
basis of APE, which due to its comprehensive display- 
and interaction facilitie:i~ proved to be an adequate 
starting point for the realisa-tion ofour ideas. 
3. Active Chart Pars ing as a Framework  for an 
ATN Env i ronment  
Active Chart parsing (\[KAP 73\]) is a highly general fra- 
mework to implement parsers. The two main ideas of 
this approach are to represent the parser's control struc- 
ture explicitly allowing high flexibility in scheduling the 
various paths to be followed and to prevent he parser 
from doing the same thing twice using a comprehensive 
bookkeeping mechanism. The interaction of these 
components is shown schematically in figure 1. 
PARSER 
Figure 1 
The possibilities of a flexible scheduling is achieved by 
means of an agenda, which at any state of the parser 
contains all the tasks that are induced by the grammar 
and not processed so far. The ordering of the agenda 
thereby determines the way, the search space is 
traversed. With this agenda-based scheduling facility 
the parser can apply various control structures like 
depth-first, breadth-first or heuristic scheduling, even 
changing it during one parse. 
Such facilities are of interest for "tuning" the parser's 
behaviour in an intended way. Agenda-based task sche- 
duling also offers the operational facilities for pruning 
parts of the search space which amounts to switching off 
certain parts of a grammar during a parse. 
The second central concept in active chart parsing, the 
chart, is a graph structure, which does not only do the 
bookkeeping of the parsed constituents (the inactive 
edges). It also records each of the partial intermediate 
steps (the active edges), thus logically representing all 
the paths in work and all constituents parsed so far 
offering the possibility to inspect he uptothen parsing 
process. 
But more important, e.g. for perspicuity, the chart (i.e. 
its graphical representation) also can be seen as a des- 
criptive representation f the parser's tate from a naive 
399 
grammar writers' point of view. It is a conceptually 
simple representation, whose atomic constructs, the 
graph's nodes, the active and inactive dges, have clear 
counterparts o the conceptual entities a grammar wri- 
ter has a naive understanding of, namely the positions in 
the sentence to parse (i.e. the nodes), the partial parses 
spawning between two nodes (i.e. the active edges) and 
already analysed constituents (i.e. the inactive edges 
spawning the sequence of words between two nodes). 
Thus a graphical representation f the chart growing as 
the parser proceeds makes the parsing process easily 
perspicuable for the user. 
4. Description of the Env i ronment  
4.1. The Grammar-Edi tor  
The user interface to the ATN grammar is built on top of 
an active graph-like representation f the single net- 
works, which is initiated by the user in a menu-based 
manner. This bird's eye view gives the user an overall 
first impression of the global structure of the whole 
grammar with the type of the ,arc (PUSH, POP, CAT, 
JUMP) and the specification of categorial" information 
with CAT- and PUSH-arcs. 
Thus the user is not beaten with an unnatural,  artificial- 
ly linearized (for example lispish) way to represent the 
basic graph-like concepts of ATNs. The benefits of such 
network-based grammar specification facilities have 
been pointed out by Grimes \[GR175\]. 
The networks, displayed in the way described above, 
additionally offers the user a number of operational 
facilities, such as getting:more specific information on a 
certain arc as for example its actions or additional tests. 
The user can activate the displayed network's arc and 
nodes respectively by clicking the mouse. 
Activating an arc hereby pops a menu with the follo- 
wing possibilities: 
- info: Gives a detailed printout of the arc, including 
its status (broken vs. unbroken). 
- delete: Deletes the arc from the network, causing a
new graphical layout of the network. 
- edit: Edits the complete arc in a mouse- and menu- 
oriented editor with all necessary facilities to 
modify various parts of the arc, such as tests, 
actions and forms as well as its weight. Lea- 
ving the editor several checks are performed, 
putting the user back into the edit mode, if the 
modified arc structure is incorrect (e.g. if it 
contains too many items or items of an incor- 
rect type at the wrong place). 
- break: Puts a break on the arc taking the user into the 
break mode with interactive facilities (as des- 
cribed below) after the broken arc's actions are 
performed. 
- unbreak: Removes a break from the arc. 
Activating a node in the network offers the following 
facilities: 
- info: 
- insert: 
Gives a detailed printout of all the arcs star- 
ting at that node. 
Allows the user to insert an arc starting at the 
node activated, the arc's ending node (except 
POP-arcs) being determined via the mouse. To 
introduce additional new nodes the user is 
prompted by the system for subsequent arcs 
until he specifies a POP-arc or an already 
existing node as ending node of the last 
prompted arc. 
400 
- merge: A new node N1 is inserted after node N with 
the leaving arcs of N now beginning at N1 and 
a new arc between N and N1. 
4.2. Grammar-Debugger  
The user can specify in advance certain constructions he
wants to be parsed, thus having the possiblitiy to test 
certain NP-constructions for example without he over- 
head of parsing awhole sentence. 
These debugging facilities can be involved in three ways: 
primarily while the parser is working in a stepper-mode 
oy means of a user interaction, secondly during the 
parser's run by means of a break put on an grammar arc 
and thirdly system-initiated at the end of the parse 
giving the user the possibility to restart. 
In the stepper-mode the user can cause a break while 
watching the chart growing as the parser processes one 
task after another in the following way. During the 
single steps of creating of the chart graphically the 
system is interruptable to give the user the opportunity 
to put APE's stepper into the break-mode ~oy mouse- 
clicking the relevant menu's item). 
In the break-mode the user is offered a number of 
operational facilities which can be accessed activating 
the chart nodes and edges with the mouse. When selec- 
ting an edge the user can get more detailled info~ana- 
tion as for example its weight, its register environment 
and its history, consisting of the path through the gram- 
mar each arc being augmented with additional informa- 
tion as its current inputword, its register environment 
and the number of the task being responsible for 
processing that arc, which directly reflects the way the 
scheduling is performed. But more importantly the 
~.ammar tester can also modify the edges in various 
dimensions, including the following options: 
- registers: 
- weight: 
- ending edge: 
The user can change registers by emplo- 
ying the same language he is used to as 
a grammar writer, i.e. in terms of 
actions defined in the ATN formalism as 
for example SETRs, ADDRs or form to 
be evaluated such as BUILDQs. 
Allows to change of the weight of an 
edge, affecting the order of further 
processing. 
With this option an edge can be modified 
with respect o the part of the input 
being spanned by it. 
This last option together with the possibilities of regi- 
ster modifying renders for example the simple simu- 
lation of the parser's behaviour under the assumption of
a (effectively missing or due to not matching tests 
blocked) grammar arc by enlarging the span of an edge. 
Another more powerful possibility in testing a grammar 
is the introduction of additional (in)active dges, con- 
necting two arbitrary nodes, which can be achieved via 
an activation of the starting arc. This allows the speci- 
fication of partial parses or parsed constituents, which - 
though missing due to some defect in the grammar - the 
user wants the to make use of in further parsing process. 
Parallel to all the options presented so far the user can 
edit the grammar on the fly, thus being able to modify 
the grammar just when he recognises certain bugs. 
Additionally APE gives the user the possibilitiy to mani- 
pulate the agenda offering him various actions to be 
performed on the single tasks l!ke freezing and kil l ing a 
task, or changing its weight, this facility provides an 
advanced grammar writer with very effective means to 
focus the parser on things that are interesting for him in 
a certain situation, abondoning with irrelevcnt paths or 
postponing them. 
Finally, when the user has done all the things that 
seemed useful to him at this break point he can continue 
the parsing process leaving the stepper options as they 
are or changing them appropriately. 
At the end of the parsing process the user again gets in a 
break mode giving him the opportunuity of inserting 
new edges with the facility to restart he parsing process 
with this new information. Thus adding a new inactive 
edge and restarting for example amounts to asking the 
parser "what would yours results have been with an 
additional constituent ci from word wj to word Wk?". 
With the facilities described above the user also can 
easily analyse a configuration when the parser did not 
succeed in parsing a certain construction? 
This description, though sketchy, should give an impres- 
sion of the ~acilitities of APE and the ideas behind it. An 
il lustration of APE's environment is shown in the appen- 
dix. 
5. Out look 
The described ATN programming environment gives 
substantial support o the user in building up a working 
grammar, but some of APE's aspects aren't completely 
sattsfymg. ~o a lot of polishing the user interface as well 
as improving the functionality isstill to be done.

Snapshot of the system in the breakmode. 
Primari ly we are currently working on an user friendly 
lexicon handling. Another augmentation will be the 
easier global specification ofvery flne-grained breaks. 
We'd like to thank U. Hochgesand, C. Maienborn and L. 
Simon for implementing parts of the environment and 
the colleagues of our lab fbr many fruitful discussions.

CONCLUSION 
The language L I  de f ined  and imp lemented  as above  was 
tes ted  on var ious  examples :  
passages  f rom t ranscr ip t ions  to  o thers  (Russ ian ,

- l og ica l  and phys lca l  p rocess ing  o f  texts ;  
ana lys i s  o f  the  context  dependent  language 
AnBnCn. 
Though we In tent iona l ly  l im i ted  the  syntax  o f  LT and 
fo rced  non-determin ism In  the  ln terpretat lon  to  f i t  our  
purpose ,  the  power  o f  th l s  language seems to  be ra ther  
su f f i c ient  fo r  the  app l i ca t ions  i t  is sbec ia l l sed  In .
