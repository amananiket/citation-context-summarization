This paper  descr ibes the application of 
markovian teaming methods to the infer- 
ence of word t ransducers .  We show how 
the proposed method d ispenses from the 
difficult design of hand-crafted rules, al- 
lows the use of weighed non determinist ic 
t ransducers  and is able to translate words 
by taking into account  their whole rather  
than by making decisions locally. These ar- 
guments  are i l lustrated on two examples: 
morphological analysis and grapheme-to- 
phoneme transcription. 
I N T R O D U C T I O N  
Several tasks  associated with elec- 
tronic lexicons may be viewed as t ransduc-  
t ions between character  strings. This may 
be the decomposit ion of words into mor- 
phemes  in morphology or  the grapheme-to-  
phoneme transcript ion in phonology. In the 
first case. one has  for example to decom- 
pose the French word "chronom~trage" into 
the sequence of affixes "chrono+m~tre+er?- 
age". In the second, "abstenlr" should be 
translated into "abstoniR",or "apstoniR" I. 
Most of the proposed methods in the 
IThese two tasks are in fact closely related 
in that {I) the correct phoneme transcription 
may mirror an underlying morphological struc- 
ture, like for "asoc/a/" whose phonemic form is 
"asos ja l"  rather than "azosja l"  due to the de- 
composition "a+soclal", and (2) the surface form 
of a derived word may depend on the pronuncl- 
aUon of its component morphemes, llke for 
"d~+harnacher" which results in "d~harnacher" 
and not "d~sharnachet". 
domain (Catach 1984; Danlos et al 1986; 
Koskenniemi 1983; Laporte 1988; Ritchle 
et al 1987, Tufts 1989; V6ronls 1988) are 
based on the availability of local rules 
whose combination, either through direct 
interpretation or by being compiled, form 
the target transducer.  
Although these methods  make it pos- 
sible - at least in theory - to design suitable 
t ransducers ,  provided that the rule de- 
scrlpUon language has  the right expressive 
power, they are complex to use because  of 
the difficulty of writing down rules. More- 
over, for a given rule language, there may 
not exist an algorithm for compil ing rules 
into a form better  suited to the translat ion 
process.  Lastly, in numerous  cases, the 
translat ion procedures are improperly de- 
terministic as shown by the example of"ab-  
stcnl f  so that it is not  possible to consider 
several competing hypotheses  in parallel 
not  to speak of ranking them according to 
some certainty factor. 
We have designed a program which 
allows to construct  ransducers  without  re- 
taming the above shortcomings.  It is no 
longer necessary to write down translat ion 
rules since the t ransducer  is obtained as 
the result  of an automat ic  learning over a 
set of examples. The t ransducer  is repre- 
sented into the language of probabil lst ic fi- 
nite state automata  (Markov models\] so 
that its use  is straightforward. Lastly, tt 
produces results  which are assigned a 
probabil ity and makes  it possible to llst 
them by decreasing order of likelihood. 
After stating the problem of character  
strings translat ion and defining the few 
- 107  - 
central not ions of markovian learnJng, this 
paper  descr ibes their adaptat ion to the 
word translat ion problem in the learning 
and translat ing phases.  This adaptat ion is 
i l lustrated through two applications: mor- 
phological analysis  and grapheme-to-pho-  
neme transcription. 
THE TRANSDUCTION PROBLEM 
In the context of character  str ings 
transduct ion,  we look for an application f: 
C* --> C'* which t ransforms certaJn words 
bui lt  over the a lphabet  C Into words over 
the a lphabet  C'. For example, In the case of 
grapheme-to -phoneme transcript ion, C is 
the set of graphemes and C' that  of pho- 
nemes.  
It may  be appropriate,  for example in 
morphology, to use  an auxil iary lexicon 
(Ritchle et al 1987; Ritchie 1989) which al- 
lows to d iscard certain translat ion results.  
For example, the decomposit ion "sage" -~ 
"ser+age" would not be allowed because  
"sef is not  a verb in the French lexicon, al- 
though this is a correct result  with respect  
to the splitt ing of word forms into affixes. 
The method we propose in this paper  is only 
concerned with descr ibing this last type of 
regularit ies leaving aside all non regular 
phenomena better  descr ibed on a case-by- 
case bas is  such as  through a lexicon. 
MARKOV MODELS 
A Markou model is a probabi l ist ic fl- 
nlte state automaton  M = (S, T, A, s I, s F, g) 
where S is a finite set of states,  A is a finite 
alphabet,  s x E S and s F ~ S are two distln- 
gulshed states called respectively the/nit /a/  
state and the final state, T is a finite set of 
transit ions,  and g Is a funct ion g: t E T --> 
(O(t), D(t), S(t), p(t)) ~ SxS  ?A? \[0, I\] such  
that 
V(se  S), ~ p(t) = l 
{tl O(t)= s\] 
where p(t) is the probabfl l ty of reaching 
state D(t) while generat ing symbol  S(t) 
start ing from state O(t). 
In general, the transit ion probablIi- 
ties p(t} are mutual ly  independent.  Yet, in 
some contexts, it may  be useful  to have 
theft values depend on others transit ions. 
In this respect, it is possible to define a one- 
to-one correspondence x , {t I O(t) = s'} 
{t I O(t) = s} such  tha~Sp(t) is equal  to 
p(~s,(t}). States s and s' are then said to be  
For every word w = a I "'" an ~ A*, the  
set of partWl paths compatible wflh w till C 
Pathl(w}, is the set of sequences  of I transi- 
t ions t I ... t l such  that  O(t 1) = % D(~} = 
O(.tj+l), for J  = 1 . . . . .  1-1 and S(tj) = aj, lo r J  
= I  . . . . .  1. 
The set of complete paths compatible 
with w, Path(w), is in turn the set of ele- 
ments  in Pathlwl(W}, where I wl = n, the 
length of word @, such  that  D(t n) = SF. 
The probabi l i ty for the model  M of 
emitt ing the word w is 
ProbM(m) = ~ l'I p(t) 
path q Path(w) t e path 
A Markov model  for which there exist 
at most  one complete path  for a given word 
is said to be  un/fl/ar. In this case, the above 
probabil i ty is reduced to 
Pr?bM(W) = l' I  p(t), if Path(w) = path  
t e path  
ProbM(w ) = O, if Path(w) = O 
Thus  the probabi l i ty PM{W) may be 
general ly computed  by adding the probabi l -  
ities observed along every path  compatible 
with w. In practice, this renders  computa -  
tionally expensive the algorithm for com- 
put ing PM(W) and it is tempt ing to assume 
that  the model is unlfllar. Practical studies 
have shown that this sub-opt imal  method 
is appl icable wi thout  great loss (Bahl et al 
1983). 
Under  this hypothesis ,  the probabil i -  
ty PM(W) may be computed  through the Vlt- 
erbi dynamic programming algorithm. In- 
deed, the probabi l i ty PM(w, 1, s}, maximal 
probabi l i ty of reaching state s with the 1 
first t ransit ions in a path compat ib le with w 
- 108 - 
is 
where (path  ~ {t l . . . t i  E Pathl(w) \[ D(t I) = s l  ) 
PM(W, O, sl) = I 
' PM(W, O, s) = O, ff (S ~ el) 
therefore 
Plvi(w, 1 + 1, s) = maXpath (P(tl + 1). PM(w, 1, D(tl))) 
where path  e {t l . . . t l+ 1 E Pathl+l(W) \[D(tl+ 1 ) = s} 
whereby 
PM(W, I + I, s) = max t (p(t) ? PM(W,  I, O(t))) 
where (te {qD(t) = sand  S(t) = ai+ll ) 
with 
= = \ [ I  p(t) PrObM(W ) PM(W, \[w\[, SF) t e MaxPath(w) 
It is therefore possible to compute  
PM(W, 1, s) recurslvely for t = 1 . . . . .  n unti l  
PrObM(W). 
Automat ic  learn ing  o f  Markov  
mode ls  
Given a training set "IS made of words 
in A* and a number  N > 2 of states, that  is 
the set S, learning a Markov model consists  
in finding a set T of transit ions such that  
the Joint probabi l i ty P of the examples in 
the training set 
P(TS) = l'I PM (w) 
we  TS 
is maximal.  
In general, the set T Is composed a 
priori of all possible transi t ions between 
states in S producing a symbol  in A. The de- 
termination of probabi l i t ies p assoc iated 
with these transi t ions Is equivalent o the 
restriction of T to e lements with non null 
probabil i ty which induces the st ructure of 
the associated automaton.  In this case, the 
model is said to be hidden because  it is 
hard to attach a meaning to the states in S. 
On the contrary, it is possible to force those 
states to have a clear-cut interpretation by 
defining them, for example, as n-grams 
which are sequences  of n e lements in A 
which encode the last n symbols  produced 
by the model to reach the state. It is clear 
that then only some transit ions are mean- 
ingful. In dealing with problems like those 
studied in the present  paper  it Is preferable 
to use  hidden models  which allow states to 
s tand for arbitrari ly complex predicates. 
The learning algorithm {Bahl et al 
1983) is based  upon the following remark: 
given a model M whose transit ions proba- 
btlltles are known a priori, the a postertori 
probabi l i ty of a transit ion t may be estimat- 
ed by the relative f requency with which t is 
used on a training set. 
The number  of t imes a transit ion t is 
used on "IS is 
freq(t) = ~ ~ 8(t, t ')  
wGTS t' e MaxPath(w) 
where 8(t, t ' )= l  f i t=t  ?. 0 otherwise 
The relative f requency of us ing t on 
"IS is 
re l - f req( t )  = 
freq(t) 
( ~' freq(t'))  
{t'l (o(t')= o(t)) } 
The learning algorithm consists  then 
in sett ing randomly the probabtltty distri- 
but ion  p(t) and adjust ing lteratively its val- 
ues  through the above formula unti l  the ad- 
Jus tment  is small enough to consider  the 
distr ibution as stat ionary.  It has  been 
shown (Bahl et al 1983) that this algorithm 
does converge towards a stat ionary value of 
the p(t} which maximizes locally 1 the prob- 
abil ity P of the training set depending on 
the initial random probabi l i ty distr ibution. 
\]In order to find a global optimum, we used 
a kind of simulated annealing technique (Kirk- 
patrick et al 1983) during the learning process. 
10~ - 
The stat ionary distr ibution defines the 
Markov model induced from the examples 
in TS i. 
TRANSDUCTION MODEL 
To be applied in both il lustrative x- 
amples, the general s t ructure of Markov 
models should be related, by means  of a 
shi~ in representat ion, to the problem of 
strings translat ion. The model of two-level 
morphological nalysis (Koskenniemi 1983) 
suggests the nature  of this shift. Indeed, 
this method, which was successful ly ap- 
plied to morphologically rich natura l  lan- 
guages (Koskenniemi 1983), Is based upon 
a two-level rule formal ism for which there 
exist a way to compile them into the lan- 
guage of finite state automata  (FSA) (Ritchie 
1989). This result  val idates the idea that  
FSAs are reasonable candidates for repre- 
senting transduct Jon rules, at least in the 
case of morphology 2. 
The shift in representat ion is de- 
signed so as to define the alphabet A as the 
set of pairs c:-  or -:c' where c e C and c 
C', - s tanding Ior the null  character,  - ~ C, 
- ? C'. The mapping between the transduc-  
er f and the associated Markov model M is 
now straightforward: 
lln practice, the number N = Card(S) of 
states for the model to be learned on a training 
set is not known. When N is small, the model 
has a tendency to generate much more charac- 
ter strings that were in "IS due to an overgener- 
alllation. At the other end of the spectrum, when 
N is large, the learned model will describe the ex- 
amples in TS and them only. So. it is among the 
intermediate values of N that an optimum has to 
be looked for, 
2Rltchle (1989) has even shown that the 
generative power of two-level morphological n- 
alyzers is strictly bound by that of finite state 
automata. He proved that all languages L gener- 
ated by these analyzers are such that whenever 
E^, E 3 and EIE2E3E. belong to L, then E2E 3 
belongs to L.  a ough tins point was not 
considered in the present study, we may sup- 
pose that constraining the learned automaton to 
respect this last property, for example by means 
of tying states, would improve the overall results 
by augmenting in a sound way the generaliza- 
tion from examples.

fori = 1 ..... n, 
ProbM(Xl.T1 ... xn.Tn) 40, 
w = delete(x) and w' = delete(y) 
where the funct ion delete is defined as 
delete(M = ~., (~. is the empty  string), 
delete(-Z} = delete(Z) and  
delete{zZ} = z.delete(Z} if z e C or z e C' 
Given a training set TS = {<w, w'> l w 
C*, w' ~ C'*}, the problem is thus  to find 
the model M that  maximizes the probabil ity 
P= \]I max- -  .Prob..{x. : yl ...Xn: yn) (w, w~ ~e T s ~x,y~ M" i 
where delete(x) = w anddelete(y) = w' 
This formula makes  it clear what  is 
the new difficulty with this type of learning, 
namely the indeterminat ion f words x and 
y, that  is of the a l ignment induced by them 
between w and its translat ion w'. The no- 
t ions of partial and complete compatible 
paths  should thus  be redefined in order to 
take this into account. 
The partial paths  compatible with w 
and w' till t and J are now the set of se- 
quences t 1 ... tl+ ! , Pathlj(W, w') such that  
O(t 1) = sl, D(t k) =O(tk+l), 'Jfor k= 1 . . . . .  l+J- 
1, S(tk)= Xk.Tk, for k = 1 . . . . .  t+J, dele- 
te(xl...xl+ 1}= wl . . .w I and  delete(Yl...Yl+j) =
W'l. . .w I.  partial path  is also complete as 
soon aS 1 = \[wl, J = Iw'\[ and D(t b~+ I~ l  ) = SF. 
As before, we can define the probabil- 
ity PM(W, 1, w', J, s) of reaching state s along 
a partial path compatible with w and w' and 
generating the first I symbols in w and J  first 
symbols in w'. 
PM(W, i, w',J, s) = maxt l  ...ti +Jk <l~l +J P(tk) 
where (t 1...tt+ j e {Patht,j(w, w')\[ D(tl+j) = s I ) 
PM(W, O, w', O, sl) = I 
PM(W, O, w', O, s) = O, if s~s  I 
- l lO -  
Here again, this probabil ity is such 
that PrObM(W, w') = PM(W, \]wl, w', \[w'l, Sv} and 
may be computed (firough dynamic pro- 
gramming according to the formula 
PM(W, i + I, w',J + I, s) = 
max ( maXt lPM(W' i 'w" J  + I"O ( t l ) )  
I maxt2PM(W , I + I, w',J, O (t2)) 
where ( t l~  {t~'I~ D(t) = set  S(t) = w l+ l : - l )  
and ( t2a  {taT \ [D( t )  = set  S(t) =- :w j :+ l \ ] )  
It is now possible to compute for every 
training example the optimal path corre- 
sponding to a given probabil i ty distr ibution 
p(t). This path not only defines the crossed 
states but  also the al ignment between w 
and w'. The learning algorithm applicable to 
general markovian models  remains valid for 
adjust ing iteratively the probabil it ies p(t). 
EXPERIMENTS 
Morpho log ica l  ana lys i s  
As a prel iminary experiment, the 
morphological analysis automaton  was 
learned on a set of 738 French words end- 
ing with the morpheme "/sme" and :associ- 
ated with their decomposit ion i to two mor- 
phemes,  the first being a noun or an 
adjective. For example, we had the pair 
<"athl~ttsme","athl~te+isme">. With a 400 
states only automaton,  the correct decom- 
posit ion was found amongst  the 10 most  
probable outputs  for 97.6% of the training 
examples !.
Grapheme- to  -phoneme 
t ranscr ip t ion  
The case of grapheme-to-phoneme 
transcription is a straightforward applica- 
tion of the t ransduct ion model. String w is 
the graphetnic form, e.g. "absten/r" and w' 
lWe are  aware  that  a more  prec ise  assess -  
ment  of the  method wou ld  use  a tes t  set  d i f fe rent  
fi 'om the t ra in ing  set .  We p lan  to per fo rm such  a 
test in the near future. 
is its transcript ion into phonemes,  e.g. "ap- 
s ten iR"  o r  "absten iR" .  Here the training 
set may feature such pairs as <w, w'> and 
<w, w"> where w' ~ w". 
The automaton was learned on a set 
of 1170 acronyms associated to their pho- 
nemic form which was descr ibed in a 
coarse phonemic a lphabet  where, for exam- 
ple, open or closed /o /  are not dlstin- 
guished. Acronyms raise an interesting 
problem in that some should be spelled let- 
ter by letter ("ACL") whereas others may be 
pronounced ("COLING"). This experiment 
was thus  intended to show that the model 
may take into account  its input  as a whole. 
With a 400 states only automaton,  more 
than 50% of the training examples were 
correctly transcr ibed when only the most 
probable output  was considered. This fig- 
ure may be improved by augment ing the 
number  of states in which case the learning 
phase becomes much longer. 
CONCLUSION 
We have proposed a method for leam- 
Ing t ransducers  for the tasks  of morpholog- 
ical analysis and grapheme-to-phoneme 
transcription. This method may be favor- 
ably compared to others solut ions based 
upon writing rules in the sense that it does 
not oblige to identify rules, it provides a re- 
sult  which is directly usab le  as a t ransduc-  
er and it allows to l is t /~anslat ions accord- 
ing to a decreasing order of probabil ity. Yet, 
the learned automaton  does not lend itself 
to an interpretation i  the form of symbolic 
rules - provided that such rules exist -. 
Moreover, some learning parameters  are 
set only as the results of empirical or ran- 
dom choices: number  of states, initial prob- 
ability distr ibution, etc. Yet, other advan- 
tages weigh for the proposed method. The 
automaton may take into account  the 
whole word to be translated rather than a 
limited part of it - this Justifies that a set of 
equivalent symbolic rules is hard to obtain 
-. For example, the grapheme-to-phoneme 
transcript ion may recognize the original 
language of a word while translating It 
(Oshlka et al 1988): the "French" nouns  
"meeting" and "carpacclo" have kept respec- 
tively their original English and Italian form 
- II1 - 
and pronunciation, etc. The learned autom- 
aton is symmetrical, thus it Is also revers- 
ible. In other words, the morphological 
analysis automaton may also be used as a 
generator and the grapheme-to-phoneme 
automaton may become a phoneme-to- 
grapheme transducer. Another emark ts in 
order: since the automaton is reversible, it
may be composed with its inverse to form, 
for example, a grapheme-to-grapheme 
translator that keeps the phonemic form 
constant without actually computing it. 
Now, it has been shown elsewhere (Reape 
and Thompson 1988) that the transducer 
that would result is also describable in the 
formalism of finite state automata nd that 
its number  of states has a upper bound 
which is the square of the number of states 
in the base automaton. (Reape and Thomp- 
son 1988) also describes an algorithm for 
computing the resulting automaton. Lastly, 
other functions than morphological naly- 
sis or grapheme-to-phoneme transcription 
may be envisioned like, for example, the de- 
composition of words into syllables or the 
computation of abbreviations by contrac- 
tion.
