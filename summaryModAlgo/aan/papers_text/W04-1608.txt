Arabic Script-based Languages deserve to be studied linguistically

Arabic script-based languages are attracting increased attention for reasons that are 
regrettably far from their intrinsic linguistic interest. At the same time, statistical and 
corpus-based approaches to language processing are acquiring such dominance that it is 
becoming difficult for the advocates of other methods even to receive a hearing. I will 
argue that this is an alarming trend against which computational linguists, and especially 
those studying these languages, should resist with great determination. My argument for 
this position rests on the following observations: 
 
1. Unless the role of quantum mechanics and chaos in the workings of ordinary 
language has been grossly underestimated, nothing about the subject is 
probabilistic in any fundamental sense. 
2. The statistics are a surrogate for knowledge of the world and artificial intelligence 
and the performance of any system based on an approach that reduces this to 
numerical annotations on linguistic structures can only hope to reach a very low 
asymptote.  
3. Thanks to Zipf?s law, corpus annotation is subject to a severe law of diminishing 
returns to which the linguist?s search for significant generalizations is not subject. 
4. To the various levels of linguistic analysis and to the indefinite range of subjects 
and propositions that texts may treat, there correspond different notions of 
locality, each requiring its own statistical models. 
5. Most importantly, most of the linguistic properties that must be considered for 
text processing are not emergent properties of the texts at all but crucially depend 
on l?arbitraire du signe, the arbitrary relation between a symbol and what it 
symbolizes.
