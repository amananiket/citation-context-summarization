para la traduccidn autom?tica (TA), tlamado 
Shake-and-Bake  (refrito), que aprovecha re- 
cientes adelantos en lingiifstica computacional en

xicallstas bmsadas en unificacidn. Se propone que

En un sistema de TA basado en transferencia~ 
este componente es especffico al par de lenguas 
entre Ins que se traduce,y por 1o tanto es nece- 
sario escribirlo ciudando de garantizar su compa- 
tibilidad con los componentes monolinl~fies. "En 
general, el mddulo de transferencia pue~le incluir 
varios centenares de reglas, y escrib\]r estas es el 
aspecto m?s costoso de\[ disefio de un sistema se- 
mejante. E1 resultado no es muy port?til, ya que 
los cambios que se realicen en los componentes 
monolingiies se reflejar~n en las reglas del trans- 
ferencia. 
Por otra parte, los m6todos de inter\]ingua ptan- 
tean lo que Landsbergen llama el problema de los 
subconjuntos. Si la mterlingua es lo suficiente- 
mente poderosa como para representar todos los 
significados de las expresiones en los idiomas en 
euestidn, habr? vaxias formulas -posiblemente un 
ndmero infinito de ellas- equivalentes a la que pro- 
duce el anaJizador. No se puede entonces garanti- 
zar que la formula produc\]da pot el analizador de 
la Lengua Fuente (LF) se encuentre bajo la cober- 
tura del generador de la Lengua Destino (LD), a 
no ser que podamos realizar inferencias 16gicas en 
la interlingua lo cual resulta de una complejidad 
exceslva. 
Shake-and-Bake  ofrece una mayor modularidad 
de los componentes LF y LD, que pueden es- 
eribirse con gran independencia los unos de los 
otros, utilizando consideraciones puramente mo- 
nollngfies. Estos componentes se relacionan me- 
diante un 16xico bilingiie. 
El formalismo utilizado es una variante de la 
gram?tica categorial de unillcaci6n o UCG (\[Cal- 
der et al 88\]), que representa objetos llngfifsticos 
como conjuntos de pares de rasgos y valores, lla- 
mados signos. Los valores de estos rasgos pue- 
den ser atdmicos, variables, o a su vez conjuntos 
de pares de rasgos y variables. Se pueden repre-

Abstract 
A novel approach to Machine Translation (MT), 
called Shake-and-Bake, is presented, which ex- 
ploits recent advances iLL Computational Linguis- 
tics in terms of tile increased spread of lexicMist 
unification-based grammar theories. It is argued 
that it overcomes some difficulties encountered by 
transfer and interfingual methods. 
It offers a greater modularity of the monolingual 
components, which can be written with indepen- 
dence of each other, using purely monofinguM 
considerations. These are put into correspon- 
dence by means of a bilingual exicon. 
The Shake-and-Bake approach for MT consists 
of parsing the Source Language in any usual way, 
then looking up the words in the bilinguM lexi- 
con, and finally generating from tile set of transla- 
tions of these words, but allowing the Target Lan- 
guage grammar to instantiate tile relative word 
ordering, taking advantage of the fact that the 
parse produces lexical and phrasal signs which are 
highly constrained (specifically in the semantics). 
TILe main algorithm presented for generation is 
a variation on the well-known CKY one used for 
parsing. 
A toy bidirectional MT system was written to 
translate between Spanish and Enghsh, and some 
of the entries are shown.

desire to exploit recent rends in Computational 
*The work reported here was carried out at the Univer- 
sity of Edinburgh under the support of a studentship from 
the Science and Engineering Research Council. Thanks to

Linguistics, such as tile appearance of lexical- 
ist unification-ba~sed grammar formalisms for the 
purposes of machine translation, in an attempt 
to overcoine what are perceived to be some of tile 
major shortcomings of transfer and inter\]ingual 
at~proaches. 
With a transfer-based MT system, the transfer 
component is very imcch language-pair specific, 
and must be written bearing very closely in mind 
both monofingual components in order to ensure 
compatibifity. Depending on how much work is 
clone by the analysis and generation components, 
the tasks carried out by the transfer element may 
vary, but iLL gener',d this module is very idiosyn- 
cratic and will involve several hundred transfer 
rules. Writing these transfer ules is the most 
time-consmning aspect of the design of a transfer- 
based system, as it nlust be consistent with hoth 
nlonolingual grammars. The process is therefore 
error-prone, and the result is not very portable, 
since the consequences of making changes to the 
monolingual components may be far-reaching as 
far as the transfer ules are concerned. 
One of the mMu difficulties with interlingual ap- 
proaches is what Laudsbergen \[Landsbergen 87\] 
refers to as the subset problem. If the system is 
to be robust, it is essential to guarantee that any 
interlingual formula derived from ally Source Lan- 
guage (SL) expression is amenable to generation 
into tile Target Language (TL). If the interlingua 
is powerful enough to represent all the meanings 
in all tile languages involved, there will be several 
t probably iatlnitely many) formulae in that inter ingua which are logically equivalent o the one 
produced by the analyser. It cannot hen be guar- 
anteed that this fornmla comes under the cover- 
age or the TL generator, unless we can draw log- 
ical inferences in the interfingua. The complexity 
of this task may be eompntationMly daunting, 
since suh-problems of this (such as satistiability 
and non-tautology) are known to be Nl'-complete 
(\[Garey and Johnson 1979\]). 
The approach presented here bears some similar- 
ity with that of \[Alshawi et al91\], which uses 
AcrEs DE COLING-92, NAIVI'~. 23-28 Aovr 1992 6 0 3 Paoc. ov COLING-92. NAntES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 
the algorithm of \[Shieber et al 90\] for generation 
from quasi-logical forms. On the other hand, gen- 
eration here takes place from a set of TL lexical 
items, with instantiated semantics, which makes 
the task easier. 
This approach was tested with independently- 
written grammars for small yet linguistically in- 
teresting fragments of Spanish and English, which 
are used both for parsing and generation. These 
are put into correspondence by means of a bilin- 
gual lexicon containing the kind of information 
one might expect to find in an ordinary bilingual 
dictionary. 
2 The  grammar  fo rmal i sm 
A version of Unification Categorial Grammar 
(UCG) (\[Calder et al 88\]) is used. Like many 
other current grammatical formalisms (\[Shieber 
86\], \[Pollard and Sag 87\], \[Uszkoreit 86D, it rep- 
resents linguistic objects by sets of feature (or 
attribute)-value pairs, called signs. The values 
of these signs may be atomic, variables or fur- 
ther sets feature-value pairs. They can therefore 
be represented as directed acyclic graphs or as 
attribute-value matrices using the PATR-II nota- 
tion of \[Shieber 86\]. The notion of unification is 
then used to combine these. 
The main features used in the signs are OR- 
THOGRAPHY, CAT (the categorial grammar syn- 
tax), OItDER (the directionality of the "slash", 
which specifies linear ordering), FEATS (a set 
of syntactic features), CASES (a case-assignment 
mechanism built on top of standard UCG), and 
SEM, a unification-based semantics with a neo- 
Davidsonian treatment of roles (\[Parsons 80, 
Dowty 89\]). The semantics of an expression is 
of the form I:P, where l i s  a variable for the se- 
mantic index of the whole expression, and P is a 
conjunction of propositions in which that index 
appears. In addition, features called ARGO, ARG\] 
and so on provide useful "handles" for allowing 
the bilingual lexicon to access the semantic in- 
dices, but they are not strictly necessary for the 
grammars 
The signs presented are only shorthand abbrevi- 
ations of the full ones used, and the interested 
reader is referred to \[Beaven 92\] for a more com- 
plete view. The PATR-II notation will be used, 
with the Prolog convention that names starting 
with upper case stand for variables. In addi- 
tion, for the sake of clarity and brevity, the non- 
essential features will be omitted, as will be their 
names when these are are obvious. 
The grammar rules used subsume both functional 
application and composition, but for the exam- 
ples given here, only functional application will 
be necessary. 
An important feature of this approach is that this 
will make it possible to have an MT system in 
which no meaningful elements in the translation 
relation are introduced syncategorematically (in 
the form of transfer rules or operations with inter- 
lingual representations). In particular, assuming 
we have very rich lexicai entries (which contain 
information about various dimensions of the lan- 
guage, such as orthography, syntax and seman- 
tics), all that is needed is a correspondence b - 
tween the lexieai entries, supplied by a bilingual 
lexicon, together with a set of constraints for each 
correspondence. 
The design of such a translation system will there- 
fore involve three components: two monolingual 
lexicons for the languages concerned, and a bilin- 
gual lexicon. The Spanish and English com- 
ponents were designed using purely monolingual 
considerations, and as a consequences the treat- 
ments of English and Spanish grammars are quite 
different. 
The basics of the grammar will be explained 
by presenting the monolingual lexical entries re- 
quired for the Spanish sentence Maria visit6 
Madrid, which corresponds to the English Mary 
visited Madrid. More linguistically interesting 
sentences will be offered at a later stage. 
2.1 The  Span ish  Grammar  
The Spanish grammar is somewhat an unconven- 
tional version of UCG, in that VPs are treated 
as sentences (S), and NPs as sentence modifiers 
(S/S in the eategorial notation). The reasons for 
this decision have to do with accounting for sub- 
ject pro-drop, and are discussed in \[Whitehick 88\] 
and \[\[leaven 92\]. A ease-assignment mechanism 
is added to standard UCG. Amongst other uses, 
it provides a coverage of clitic placement. 
NPs are sentence modifiers. The following one, 
for instance, looks for a sentence with semantics 
11: Seml, and returns another sentence, in which 
the semantics have been modified to state that 
F3 (an index standing for Maria), plays a certain 
(unspecified) role in the semantics of 11. The op- 
eration U stands for set union, and "all the propo- 
sitions in the semantics are interpreted here as 
being conjoined.

Since intransitive verbs axe sentences, a transitive 
verb must be a sentence looking for its object NP 
(now S/S), which makes ure that this object gets 
identified with index Y (which fills tile patient

role). This is carried out by the case-assignment 
mechanism, not shown here. The following en- 
try for tim transitive verb will be derived from 
the base form and abstract tense morphemes ( ee 
below).

name(L3,madrid) 
Since Spanish word order is relatively free (and 
in particular since the OVS ordering is possible), 
the verb does not put tight constraints on the 
directionality of the NPs. The case-assignment 
mechanism, which identifies the indices of the 
NPs, can be used to interact with the ORDER fea- 
ture if this is desired. In tim above example, the 
only thing that prevents the assignment of agent 
role to Madrid and patient role to Maria are con- 
straints on the semantic types of the arguments 
of the verb.

The English grammar is virtually taken "off the 
shelf" and closely resembles that of \[Calder et al

follows:

2.3 S t ructure  o f  the  b i l ingua l  lex icon 
Tile bilingual exicon merely puts into correspom 
dence pairs of monolingual lexieM entries. In 
other words, each entry in the bilingual lexicon 
will contain a pair of pointers to monolingual em 
tries in each of the languages translated. These 
monolingual entries are very rich signs, and the 
bilingual entries may add constraints for their 
monolingual signs to be in the translation rela- 
tion. For instance, if a word has more than one 
translation depending on how various semantic 
featnres become instantiated, the bilinguM lexi- 
cal entries may express these restrictions. 
The bilingual exicon writer needs to be aware of 
what the monolingual lexicons look like, in order 
to encode the restrictions that the bilingual sign 
imposes on the monollngual entries. As long as 
some broad conventions are followed, this task be- 
comes very straightforward. Most bilingual cor- 
respondences are very simple, and merely require 
some semantic indices in the monolingual signs to 
be unified. Provided these indices are made eas- 
ily available in predictable places of tile monolin- 
gum signs, the task of writing the corresponding 
lexical entries is very simple. When some seman- 
tic constraints need to be put on these indices, 
again it is a straightforward task. It is only on 
the occasions when syntactic onstraints have to 
be included that the monollnguM signs need to 
be examined more closely, in order to determine 
how that syntactic information is encoded. 
This results in a great modularity in the sys- 
tem. Any monolingual component may easily be 
changed, without affecting to any significant ex- 
tent the bilingual lexicon, and certainly not tile 
monollngual components for any other language. 
At the same time, the simplicity of the bilingual 
component makes it practicable to write multi- 
language systems, since all the hard work goes 
into the monolingual lexicons which may be re- 
used for many language pairs, and the language- 
pair-specific information is concisely kept in the 
bilingual exicon. 
The following examples represent entries in the 
bilingual exicon. Such an entry consists of point- 
ers to monolingual signs (for instance, (9) pnts 
signs (1) and (6)into correspondence), together 
with constraints about the semantic indices con- 
talned in these signs. Thus example (9) identifies

(The above is not exactly the entry as it appears 
ill the billngnai lexicon, since correspondences be-
tween morphemes are used, but it clarifies the 
exposition). 
(11) 
SPANISII ~ \[;EM \[AnGO F3 
Ill this very simple example, there was a one- 
to-one correspondence b tween monolinguM en- 
tries. More generally, tile hilinguM lexicon will 
encode correspondences between sets of nlono- 
lingual entries, with appropriate constraints on 
them (which allows us to enter idioms in the 
bilingual lexicon). Most of the time these will 
be singletons, but they may occasiomflly contain 
several elements or indeed one of them may be 
empty (if a word in one language corresponds to 
the empty string in the other, as will sometimes 
occur with function words). 
3 Shake-and-Bake  
A new algorithm for generation, developcd by 
Pete Whitelock and Mike Reape, and known as 
Shake-and-Bake is presented (see \[Whitelock 
92\] for further discussion). It can be outlined as 
follows: first of all the SL expression is parsed 
using the SL (monolingual) grammar. After the 
parse is complete the variables in the semantic 
indices are Skolemised, and lexical entries are 
looked up in the bilingual lexicon and replaced 
with their TL equivalents. Generation then takes 
place starting from the bag of TL lexical entries, 
which have their semantic indices instantiated as 
a result of the parsing and look-up process. 
Two well-known parsing algorithms (shift-reduce 
and CKY) have been adapted to do this kind of 
ACTES DE COLING-92, NANTEs, 23-28 AO~" 1992 6 0 6 PROC. OF COLING-92, NAtCrEs, AUG. 23-28. 1992 
generation instead. Generation in tiffs context 
can be seen ms a variation of parsing, in which we 
let ttm syntactic onstraints instantiate the word 
order rather than letting the word order drive the 
parsing process. 
The CKY parsing algorithm may be eharacterised 
a~ follows: it uses a chart or table where all 
well-formed substrings (WFSs) that are found are 
recorded, together with their position (i.e. the 
words that they span in the string). The ta- 
ble is initialised with tile n words of the input 
string. The algorithm builds parses by tinding 
the shorter WFSs before the longer ones. For all 
integers j between 2 attd n, it records all WFSs 
of length j by looking for two adjacent strings of 
length k and j - k recorded on the table. If they 
may combine hy means of a grammar rule, the 
result is recorded on the table. 
The algorithm may be modified for generating 
strings from a bag of lexical entries. The table 
here no longer records the position of WFSs, but 
just the WFSs with the set of entries from the 
bag that they are made from. It is initialised 
by recording first all the well-formed strings of 
length 1 (the lexieal entries). Then, for all inte- 
gers j from 2 to n (the cardinality of the bag), 
it looks for two disjoint WFSs of length k and 
j - k recorded in the table. If they combine by 
means of an (unordered) grammar rule, the re- 
sulting string (with orthography specified hy the 
direction of the combination) is recorded on the 
table, together with the set of entries it involves 
(the union of the sets of the two components): 
Starting from the bag of TL signs above, this al- 
gorithm would first put the verb and object to- 
gether into a component, and then combine the 
result of that with the subject of the sentence. 
Linear ordering is determined hy tile TL gram- 
mar and the fact that the semantic indices a~'e 
instantiated by the tinm generation takes place. 
4 Morphology and Further ex- 
amples 
Finally we shall see how Shake-and-Bake handles 
more interesting examples, in particular those in- 
volving argument switching and head switching. 
Entries for verbs such as the ones shown above 
are derived from the base forms and single mor- 
phemes. \]~br instance, visitedis derived from mor- 
phemes for visit, 3sg and past. A similar thing is 
clone for Spanish, and the bilingual lexicon ac- 
tually puts into correspondence the hase forms 
and the separate morphemes. Correspondences 
between morphemes will be used from here on. 
4.1 Argument  sw i tch ing  
Argument switching, such as John likes Mary, 
which translates into Spanish as Maria gusta a 
Juan (literally Mary pleases John can be covered 
in a very simple manner. The monolingual verbs 
closely resemble (2) and (7). 
Their essential features are just:

4.2 Head swi tch ing  
A harder example is when the head word in one 
language corresponds to a non-head in the other, 
such as Mary swam across the river, which trans- 
lates as Mama cruz6 el rio nadando (literally 
Mary crossed the river swimming). 
This can be solved by putting into correspon- 
dence across with the stem cruz- as a possi- 
ble translation pair, together with the base form 
swim with nadando. Tile morphemes for 3so and

The important aspects of these signs is that the 
bilingual element correctly identifies the indices of 
the lexical entries, and the Shake-and-Bake gen- 
eration takes care of the rest. 
5 Conc lus ion  
I hope to have shown how lexically-driven Ma- 
chine Translation makes it possible to write 
modern, unification-based monolingual gram- 
mars with great independence from each other, 
and to put them into correspondence by means 
of a bilingual exicon of a similar degree of com- 
plexity as one might expect o find in a commonly 
available bilingual dictionary, which could make 
it easier to automate its construction. 
These points were demonstrated by constructing 
two monolingual Unification Categorial Gram- 
mars for small fragments of Spanish and English, 
which nevertheless included some lingnistically 
interesting phenoinena. They were written inde- 
pendently, and with purely monolingual consid- 
erations in mind, which led to some noticeable 
differences in the grammar design. The monolim 
gual components were put into correspondence by 
means of a bilingual lexicon, and algorithms for 
parsing, doing bilingual lookup and generation 
were suggested, which together constitute what 
has been named Shake-and-Bake  Trans lat ion.  
While the process of Shake and Bake generation 
itself is NP-complete, it is likely that average case 
complexity may be reasonable (\[Brew 92\]). In 
this sense, Shake and Bake may address issues 
raised by the Landsbergen's subset problem, since 
inference in an interlingua may not even be de- 
cidable.
