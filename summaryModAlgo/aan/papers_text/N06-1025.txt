Abstract
In this paper we present an extension of
a machine learning based coreference res-
olution system which uses features in-
duced from different semantic knowledge
sources. These features represent knowl-
edge mined from WordNet and Wikipedia,
as well as information about semantic role
labels. We show that semantic features in-
deed improve the performance on differ-
ent referring expression types such as pro-
nouns and common nouns.
1 Introduction
The last years have seen a boost of work devoted to
the development of machine learning based coref-
erence resolution systems (Soon et al, 2001; Ng &
Cardie, 2002; Yang et al, 2003; Luo et al, 2004,
inter alia). While machine learning has proved to
yield performance rates fully competitive with rule
based systems, current coreference resolution sys-
tems are mostly relying on rather shallow features,
such as the distance between the coreferent expres-
sions, string matching, and linguistic form. How-
ever, the literature emphasizes since the very begin-
ning the relevance of world knowledge and infer-
ence for coreference resolution (Charniak, 1973).
This paper explores whether coreference resolu-
tion can benefit from semantic knowledge sources.
More specifically, whether a machine learning based
approach to coreference resolution can be improved
and which phenomena are affected by such infor-
mation. We investigate the use of the WordNet and
Wikipedia taxonomies for extracting semantic simi-
larity and relatedness measures, as well as semantic
parsing information in terms of semantic role label-
ing (Gildea & Jurafsky, 2002, SRL henceforth).
We believe that the lack of semantics in the cur-
rent systems leads to a performance bottleneck.
In order to correctly identify the discourse entities
which are referred to in a text, it seems essential to
reason over the lexical semantic relations, as well as
the event representations embedded in the text. As
an example, consider a fragment from the Automatic
Content Extraction (ACE) 2003 data.
(1) But frequent visitors say that given the sheer weight of
the country?s totalitarian ideology and generations of
mass indoctrination, changing this country?s course will
be something akin to turning a huge ship at sea. Opening
North Korea up, even modestly, and exposing people to
the idea that Westerners ? and South Koreans ? are not
devils, alone represents an extraordinary change. [...] as
his people begin to get a clearer idea of the deprivation
they have suffered, especially relative to their neighbors.
?This is a society that has been focused most of all on
stability, [...]?.
In order to correctly resolve the anaphoric expres-
sions highlighted in bold, it seems that some kind
of lexical semantic and encyclopedic knowledge is
required. This includes that North Korea is a coun-
try, that countries consist of people and are soci-
eties. The resolution requires an encyclopedia (i.e.
Wikipedia) look-up and reasoning on the content re-
latedness holding between the different expressions
(i.e. as a path measure along the links of the Word-
Net and Wikipedia taxonomies). Event representa-
tions seem also to be important for coreference res-
olution, as shown below:
(2) A state commission of inquiry into the sinking of the
Kursk will convene in Moscow on Wednesday, the
Interfax news agency reported. It said that the diving
operation will be completed by the end of next week.
192
In this example, knowing that the Interfax news
agency is the AGENT of the report predicate and It
being the AGENT of say could trigger the (seman-
tic parallelism based) inference required to correctly
link the two expressions, in contrast to anchoring
the pronoun to Moscow. SRL provides the seman-
tic relationships that constituents have with predi-
cates, thus allowing us to include such document-
level event descriptive information into the relations
holding between referring expressions (REs).
Instead of exploring different kinds of data rep-
resentations, task definitions or machine learning
techniques (Ng & Cardie, 2002; Yang et al, 2003;
Luo et al, 2004) we focus on a few promising se-
mantic features which we evaluate in a controlled
environment. That way we try to overcome the
plateauing in performance in coreference resolution
observed by Kehler et al (2004).
2 Related Work
Vieira & Poesio (2000), Harabagiu et al (2001),
and Markert & Nissim (2005) explore the use of
WordNet for different coreference resolution sub-
tasks, such as resolving bridging reference, other-
and definite NP anaphora, and MUC-style corefer-
ence resolution. All of them present systems which
infer coreference relations from a set of potential an-
tecedents by means of a WordNet search. Our ap-
proach to WordNet here is to cast the search results
in terms of semantic similarity measures. Their out-
put can be used as features for a learner. These mea-
sures are not specifically developed for coreference
resolution but simply taken ?off-the-shelf? and ap-
plied to our task without any specific tuning ? i.e.
in contrast to Harabagiu et al (2001), who weight
WordNet relations differently in order to compute
the confidence measure of the path.
To the best of our knowledge, we do not know
of any previous work using Wikipedia or SRL for
coreference resolution. In the case of SRL, this
layer of semantic context abstracts from the specific
lexical expressions used, and therefore represents a
higher level of abstraction than (still related) work
involving predicate argument statistics. Kehler et al
(2004) observe no significant improvement due to
predicate argument statistics. The improvement re-
ported by Yang et al (2005) is rather caused by their
twin-candidate model than by the semantic knowl-
edge. Employing SRL is closer in spirit to Ji et al
(2005), who explore the employment of the ACE
2004 relation ontology as a semantic filter.
3 Coreference Resolution Using Semantic
Knowledge Sources
3.1 Corpora Used
To establish a competitive coreference resolver, the
system was initially prototyped using the MUC-6
and MUC-7 data sets (Chinchor & Sundheim, 2003;
Chinchor, 2001), using the standard partitioning
of 30 texts for training and 20-30 texts for test-
ing. Then, we moved on and developed and tested
the system with the ACE 2003 Training Data cor-
pus (Mitchell et al, 2003)1. Both the Newswire
(NWIRE) and Broadcast News (BNEWS) sections
where split into 60-20-20% document-based par-
titions for training, development, and testing, and
later per-partition merged (MERGED) for system
evaluation. The distribution of coreference chains
and referring expressions is given in Table 1.
3.2 Learning Algorithm
For learning coreference decisions, we used a Maxi-
mum Entropy (Berger et al, 1996) model. This was
implemented using the MALLET library (McCal-
lum, 2002). To prevent the model from overfitting,
we employed a tunable Gaussian prior as a smooth-
ing method. The best parameter value is found by
searching in the [0,10] interval with step value of
0.5 for the variance parameter yielding the highest
MUC score F-measure on the development data.
Coreference resolution is viewed as a binary clas-
sification task: given a pair of REs, the classifier has
to decide whether they are coreferent or not. The
MaxEnt model produces a probability for each cat-
egory y (coreferent or not) of a candidate pair, con-
ditioned on the context x in which the candidate oc-
curs. The conditional probability is calculated by:
p(y|x) = 1Zx
[
?
i
?ifi(x, y)
]
1We used the training data corpus only, as the availability
of the test data is restricted to ACE participants. Therefore, the
results we report cannot be compared directly with those using
the official test data.

In our system, a set of pre-processing compo-
nents including a POS tagger (Gime?nez & Ma`rquez,
2004), NP chunker (Kudoh & Matsumoto, 2000)
and the Alias-I LingPipe Named Entity Recognizer2
is applied to the text in order to identify the noun
phrases, which are further taken as referring ex-
pressions (REs) to be used for instance generation.
Therefore, we use automatically extracted noun
phrases, rather than assuming perfect NP chunk-
ing. This is in contrast to other related works
in coreference resolution (e.g. Luo et al (2004),
Kehler et al (2004)).
Instances are created following Soon et al (2001).
We create a positive training instance from each pair
of adjacent coreferent REs. Negative instances are
obtained by pairing the anaphoric REs with any RE
occurring between the anaphor and the antecedent.
During testing each text is processed from left to
right: each RE is paired with any preceding RE from
right to left, until a pair labeled as coreferent is out-
put, or the beginning of the document is reached.
The classifier imposes a partitioning on the available
REs by clustering each set of expressions labeled as
coreferent into the same coreference chain.

3.3 Baseline System Features
Following Ng & Cardie (2002), our baseline sys-
tem reimplements the Soon et al (2001) system.
The system uses 12 features. Given a potential an-
tecedent REi and a potential anaphor REj the fea-
tures are computed as follows3.
(a) Lexical features
STRING MATCH T if REi and REj have the
same spelling, else F.
ALIAS T if one RE is an alias of the other; else F.
(b) Grammatical features
I PRONOUN T if REi is a pronoun; else F.
J PRONOUN T if REj is a pronoun; else F.
J DEF T if REj starts with the; else F.
J DEM T if REj starts with this, that, these, or
those; else F.
NUMBER T if both REi and REj agree in number;
else F.
GENDER U if either REi or REj have an undefined
gender. Else if they are both defined and agree
T; else F.
PROPER NAME T if both REi and REj are
proper names; else F.
APPOSITIVE T if REj is in apposition with REi;
else F.
(c) Semantic features
WN CLASS U if either REi or REj have an unde-
fined WordNet semantic class. Else if they both
have a defined one and it is the same T; else F.
(d) Distance features
DISTANCE how many sentences REi and REj are
apart.
3Possible values are U(nknown), T(rue) and F(alse). Note
that in contrast to Ng & Cardie (2002) we interpret ALIAS as
a lexical feature, as it solely relies on string comparison and
acronym string matching.
194
3.4 WordNet Features
In the baseline system semantic information is lim-
ited to WordNet semantic class matching. Unfor-
tunately, a WordNet semantic class lookup exhibits
problems such as coverage, sense proliferation and
ambiguity4, which make the WN CLASS feature
very noisy. We enrich the semantic information
available to the classifier by using semantic similar-
ity measures based on the WordNet taxonomy (Ped-
ersen et al, 2004). The measures we use include
path length based measures (Rada et al, 1989; Wu &
Palmer, 1994; Leacock & Chodorow, 1998), as well
as ones based on information content (Resnik, 1995;
Jiang & Conrath, 1997; Lin, 1998).
In our case, the measures are obtained by comput-
ing the similarity scores between the head lemmata
of each potential antecedent-anaphor pair. In order
to overcome the sense disambiguation problem, we
factorise over all possible sense pairs: given a can-
didate pair, we take the cross product of each an-
tecedent and anaphor sense to form pairs of synsets.
For each measure WN SIMILARITY, we compute
the similarity score for all synset pairs, and create
the following features.
WN SIMILARITY BEST the highest similarity
score from all ?SENSEREi,n, SENSEREj ,m? synset
pairs.
WN SIMILARITY AVG the average similarity
score from all ?SENSEREi,n, SENSEREj ,m? synset
pairs.
Pairs containing REs which cannot be mapped to
WordNet synsets are assumed to have a null simi-
larity measure.
3.5 Wikipedia Features
Wikipedia is a multilingual Web-based free-content
encyclopedia5 . The English version, as of 14 Febru-
ary 2006, contains 971,518 articles with 16.8 mil-
lion internal hyperlinks thus providing a large cover-
age available knowledge resource. In addition, since
May 2004 it provides also a taxonomy by means of
the category feature: articles can be placed in one
4Following the system to be replicated, we simply mapped
each RE to the first WordNet sense of the head noun.
5Wikipedia can be downloaded at http://download.
wikimedia.org/. In our experiments we use the English
Wikipedia database dump from 19 February 2006.
or more categories, which are further categorized to
provide a category tree. In practice, the taxonomy
is not designed as a strict hierarchy or tree of cat-
egories, but allows multiple categorisation schemes
to co-exist simultaneously. Because each article can
appear in more than one category, and each category
can appear in more than one parent category, the cat-
egories do not form a tree structure, but a more gen-
eral directed graph. As of December 2005, 78% of
the articles have been categorized into 87,000 differ-
ent categories.
Wikipedia mining works as follows (for an in-
depth description of the methods for computing
semantic relatedness in Wikipedia see Strube &
Ponzetto (2006)): given the candidate referring ex-
pressions REi and REj we first pull the pages they
refer to. This is accomplished by querying the page
titled as the head lemma or, in the case of NEs, the
full NP. We follow all redirects and check for dis-
ambiguation pages, i.e. pages for ambiguous entries
which contain links only (e.g. Lincoln). If a disam-
biguation page is hit, we first get al the hyperlinks
in the page. If a link containing the other queried RE
is found (i.e. a link containing president in the Lin-
coln page), the linked page (President of the United
States) is returned, else we return the first article
linked in the disambiguation page. Given a candi-
date coreference pair REi/j and the Wikipedia pages
PREi/j they point to, obtained by querying pages ti-
tled as TREi/j , we extract the following features:
I/J GLOSS CONTAINS U if no Wikipedia page
titled TREi/j is available. Else T if the first para-
graph of text of PREi/j contains TREj/i ; else F.
I/J RELATED CONTAINS U if no Wikipedia
page titled as TREi/j is available. Else T if at
least one Wikipedia hyperlink of PREi/j con-
tains TREj/i ; else F.
I/J CATEGORIES CONTAINS U if no Wiki-
pedia page titled as TREi/j is available. Else T if
the list of categories PREi/j belongs to contains
TREj/i ; else F.
GLOSS OVERLAP the overlap score between the
first paragraph of text of PREi and PREj . Fol-
lowing Banerjee & Pedersen (2003) we compute
the score as
?
n m2 for n phrasal m-word over-
laps.
195
Additionally, we use the Wikipedia category graph.
We ported the WordNet similarity path length based
measures to the Wikipedia category graph. How-
ever, the category relations in Wikipedia cannot only
be interpreted as corresponding to is-a links in a
taxonomy since they denote meronymic relations
as well. Therefore, the Wikipedia-based measures
are to be taken as semantic relatedness measures.
The measures from Rada et al (1989), Leacock &
Chodorow (1998) and Wu & Palmer (1994) are com-
puted in the same way as for WordNet. Path search
takes place as a depth-limited search of maximum
depth of 4 for a least common subsumer. We no-
ticed that limiting the search improves the results as
it yields a better correlation of the relatedness scores
with human judgements (Strube & Ponzetto, 2006).
This is due to the high regions of the Wikipedia cat-
egory tree being too strongly connected.
In addition, we use the measure from Resnik
(1995), which is computed using an intrinsic in-
formation content measure relying on the hierar-
chical structure of the category tree (Seco et al,
2004). Given PREi/j and the lists of categories
CREi/j they belong to, we factorise over all pos-
sible category pairs. That is, we take the cross
product of each antecedent and anaphor category to
form pairs of ?Wikipedia synsets?. For each mea-
sure WIKI RELATEDNESS, we compute the relat-
edness score for all category pairs, and create the
following features.
WIKI RELATEDNESS BEST the highest relat-
edness score from all ?CREi,n, CREj ,m? cate-
gory pairs.
WIKI RELATEDNESS AVG the average relat-
edness score from all ?CREi,n, CREj ,m? cate-
gory pairs.
3.6 Semantic Role Features
The last semantic knowledge enhancement for the
baseline system uses SRL information. In our exper-
iments we use the ASSERT parser (Pradhan et al,
2004), an SVM based semantic role tagger which
uses a full syntactic analysis to automatically iden-
tify all verb predicates in a sentence together with
their semantic arguments, which are output as Prop-
Bank arguments (Palmer et al, 2005). It is of-
ten the case that the semantic arguments output by
the parser do not align with any of the previously
identified noun phrases. In this case, we pass a
semantic role label to a RE only when the two
phrases share the same head. Labels have the form
?ARG1 pred1 . . . ARGn predn? for n semantic roles
filled by a constituent, where each semantic argu-
ment label is always defined with respect to a predi-
cate. Given such level of semantic information avail-
able at the RE level, we introduce two new features6.
I SEMROLE the semantic role argument-
predicate pairs of REi.
J SEMROLE the semantic role argument-
predicate pairs of REj .
For the ACE 2003 data, 11,406 of 32,502 automati-
cally extracted noun phrases were tagged with 2,801
different argument-predicate pairs.
4 Experiments
4.1 Performance Metrics
We report in the following tables the MUC
score (Vilain et al, 1995). Scores in Table 2 are
computed for all noun phrases appearing in either
the key or the system response, whereas Tables 3
and 4 refer to scoring only those phrases which ap-
pear in both the key and the response. We therefore
discard those responses not present in the key, as we
are interested in establishing the upper limit of the
improvements given by our semantic features. That
is, we want to define a baseline against which to es-
tablish the contribution of the semantic information
sources explored here for coreference resolution.
In addition, we report the accuracy score for all
three types of ACE mentions, namely pronouns,
common nouns and proper names. Accuracy is the
percentage of REs of a given mention type correctly
resolved divided by the total number of REs of the
same type given in the key. A RE is said to be cor-
rectly resolved when both it and its direct antecedent
are placed by the key in the same coreference class.
6During prototyping we experimented unpairing the argu-
ments from the predicates, which yielded worse results. This
is supported by the PropBank arguments always being defined
with respect to a target predicate. Binarizing the features ? i.e.
do REi and REj have the same argument or predicate label with
respect to their closest predicate? ? also gave worse results.

4.2 Feature Selection
For determining the relevant feature sets we follow
an iterative procedure similar to the wrapper ap-
proach for feature selection (Kohavi & John, 1997)
using the development data. The feature subset se-
lection algorithm performs a hill-climbing search
along the feature space. We start with a model
based on all available features. Then we train mod-
els obtained by removing one feature at a time. We
choose the worst performing feature, namely the one
whose removal gives the largest improvement based
on the MUC score F-measure, and remove it from
the model. We then train classifiers removing each
of the remaining features separately from the en-
hanced model. The process is iteratively run as long
as significant improvement is observed.
4.3 Results
Table 2 compares the results between our duplicated
Soon baseline and the original system. We assume
that the slight improvements of our system are due
to the use of current pre-processing components and
another classifier. Tables 3 and 4 show a comparison
of the performance between our baseline system and
the ones incremented with semantic features. Per-
formance improvements are highlighted in bold7.
4.4 Discussion
The tables show that semantic features improve sys-
tem recall, rather than acting as a ?semantic filter?
improving precision. Semantics therefore seems to
trigger a response in cases where more shallow fea-
tures do not seem to suffice (see examples (1-2)).
Different feature sources account for different
RE type improvements. WordNet and Wikipedia
features tend to increase performance on common
7All changes in F-measure are statistically significant at the
0.05 level or higher. We follow Soon et al (2001) in performing
a simple one-tailed, paired sample t-test between the baseline

nouns, whereas SRL improves pronouns. Word-
Net features are able to improve by 14.3% and
7.7% the accuracy rate for common nouns on the
BNEWS and NWIRE datasets (+34 and +37 cor-
rectly resolved common nouns out of 238 and 484
respectively), whereas employing Wikipedia yields
slightly smaller improvements (+13.0% and +6.6%
accuracy increase on the same datasets). Similarly,
when SRL features are added to the baseline system,
we register an increase in the accuracy rate for pro-
nouns, ranging from 0.7% in BNEWS and NWIRE
up to 4.2% in the MERGED dataset (+26 correctly
resolved pronouns out of 620).
If semantics helps for pronouns and common
nouns, it does not affect performance on proper
names, where features such as string matching and
alias suffice. This suggests that semantics plays a
role in pronoun and common noun resolution, where
surface features cannot account for complex prefer-
ences and semantic knowledge is required.
The best accuracy improvement on pronoun res-
olution is obtained on the MERGED dataset. This
is due to making more data available to the classi-
fier, as the SRL features are very sparse and inher-
ently suffer from data fragmentation. Using a larger
dataset highlights the importance of SRL, whose
features are never removed in any feature selection
process8. The accuracy on common nouns shows
that features induced from Wikipedia are competi-
tive with the ones from WordNet. The performance
gap on all three datasets is quite small, which indi-
cates the usefulness of using an encyclopedic knowl-
edge base as a replacement for a lexical taxonomy.
As a consequence of having different knowledge
sources accounting for the resolution of different RE
types, the best results are obtained by (1) combin-
ing features generated from different sources; (2)
performing feature selection. When combining dif-
ferent feature sources, we register an accuracy im-
provement on pronouns and common nouns, as well
as an increase in F-measure due to a higher recall.
Feature selection always improves results. This
is due to the fact that our full feature set is ex-
8To our knowledge, most of the recent work in coreference
resolution on the ACE data keeps the document source sepa-
rated for evaluation. However, we believe that document source
independent evaluation provides useful insights on the robust-
ness of the system (cf. the CoNLL 2005 shared task cross-
corpora evaluation).

tremely redundant: in order to explore the useful-
ness of the knowledge sources we included overlap-
ping features (i.e. using best and average similar-
ity/relatedness measures at the same time), as well as
features capturing the same phenomenon from dif-
ferent point of views (i.e. using multiple measures
at the same time). In order to yield the desired per-
formance improvements, it turns out to be essential
to filter out irrelevant features.
Table 5 shows the relevance of the best perform-
ing features on the BNEWS section. As our fea-
ture selection mechanism chooses the best set of fea-
tures by removing them (see Section 4.2), we eval-
uate the contributions of the remaining features as
follows. We start with a baseline system using all
the features from Soon et al (2001) that were not
removed in the feature selection process (i.e. DIS-
TANCE). We then train classifiers combining the
current feature set with each feature in turn. We
then choose the best performing feature based on the
MUC score F-measure and add it to the model. We
iterate the process until all features are added to the
baseline system. The table indicates that all knowl-
edge sources are relevant for coreference resolution,
as it includes SRL, WordNet and Wikipedia features.
The Wikipedia features rank high, indicating again
that it provides a valid knowledge base.

to improve as well as the encyclopedia goes under
further development.
In this paper we investigated the effects of using
different semantic knowledge sources within a ma-
chine learning based coreference resolution system.
This involved mining the WordNet taxonomy and
the Wikipedia encyclopedic knowledge base, as well
as including semantic parsing information, in order
to induce semantic features for coreference learning.
Empirical results show that coreference resolution
benefits from semantics. The generated model is
able to learn selectional preferences in cases where
surface morpho-syntactic features do not suffice, i.e.
pronoun and common name resolution. While the
results given by using ?the free encyclopedia that
anyone can edit? are satisfactory, major improve-
ments can come from developing efficient query
strategies ? i.e. a more refined disambiguation tech-
nique taking advantage of the context in which the
queries (e.g. referring expressions) occur.
Future work will include turning Wikipedia into
an ontology with well defined taxonomic relations,
as well as exploring its usefulness of for other NLP
applications. We believe that an interesting aspect of
Wikipedia is that it offers large coverage resources
for many languages, thus making it a natural choice
for multilingual NLP systems.
Semantics plays indeed a role in coreference
resolution. But semantic features are expensive to
198
compute and the development of efficient methods
is required to embed them into large scale systems.
Nevertheless, we believe that exploiting semantic
knowledge in the manner we described will assist
the research on coreference resolution to overcome
the plateauing in performance observed by Kehler
et al (2004).
