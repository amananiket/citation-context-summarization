Abstract 
I:n this paper, we describe a new corpus-based ap- 
proach to prepositional phrase attachment disam- 
biguation, and present results colnparing peffo> 
mange of this algorithm with other corpus-based 
approaches to this problem. 
Introduction 
Prel)ositioual phrase attachment disambiguation 
is a difficult problem. Take, for example, the sen- 
rouge: 
( l )  Buy a ear \[p,o with a steering wheel\]. 
We would guess that the correct interpretation is 
that one should buy cars that come with steer- 
ing wheels, and not that one should use a steering 
wheel as barter for purchasing a car. \]n this case, 
we are helped by our world knowledge about auto- 
mobiles and automobile parts, and about typical 
methods of barter, which we can draw upon to cor- 
rectly disambignate he sentence. Beyond possibly 
needing such rich semantic or conceptual int'ornla- 
tion, A l tmann and Steedman (AS88) show that 
there a,re certain cases where a discourse model 
is needed to correctly disambiguate prepositional 
phrase atta.chment. 
However, while there are certainly cases of an> 
biguity that seem to need some deep knowledge, 
either linguistic or conceptual, one might ask whag 
sort of performance could 1oe achieved by a sys- 
tem thai uses somewhat superficial knowledge au-

tomatically ~xtracted from a large corpus. Recent 
work has shown thai; this approach olds promise 
(H\]~,91, HR93). 
hi this paper we describe a new rule-based ap- 
proach to prepositional phrase attachment, disam- 
biguation. A set of silnple rules is learned au- 
tomatically to try to prediet proper attachment 
based on any of a number of possible contextual 
giles. 
Baseline 
l l indle and Rooth (IIR91, 1\[17{93) describe 
corpus-based approach to disambiguating between 
prepositional phrase attachlnent to the main verb 
and to the object nonn phrase (such as in the ex- 
ample sentence above). They first point out that 
simple attachment s rategies snch as right associa- 
tion (Kim73) and miuimal a.tbtchment (Fra78) do 
not work well i,l practice' (see (WFB90)). They 
then suggest using lexical preference, estimated 
from a large corpus of text, as a method of re- 
solving attachment ambiguity, a technique the}' 
call "lexical association." From a large corpus of 
pursed text, they first find all nonn phrase heads, 
and then record the verb (if' any) that precedes the 
head, and the preposition (if any) that follows it, 
as well as some other syntactic inforlnation about 
the sentence. An algorithm is then specified 1,o try 
to extract attachment information h'om this table 
of co-occurrences. I!'or instance, a table entry is 
cousidered a definite instance of the prepositional 
phrase attaching to the noun if: 
'\['he noun phrase occm:s in a context where 
no verb could license the prepositional phrase, 
specifically if the noun phrase is in a subjeet 
or other pre-verbal position. 
They specify seven different procedures for decid- 
ing whether a table entry is au instance of no 
attachment, sure noun attach, sm:e verb attach, 
or all ambiguous attach. Using these procedures, 
they are able to extract frequency information, 
1198 
counting t, he numl)e,r of times a ptu:ticular verb 
or ncmn a.ppe~u:s with a pal:tieuh~r l~reposition. 
These frequen(;ies erve a.s training d~t;a for 
the statistical model they use to predict correct 
i~ttachmenL To dismnbigu;~te s ntence (l), they 
would compute the likelihood of the preposition 
with giwm the verb buy, {rod eolltrast that with 
the likelihood of that preposition given I:he liOttll 
whed. 
()he, problem wit;h this ,~pproa~ch is tll~tt it 
is limited in what rel~tionships are examined to 
make mi ~d;tachment decision. Simply extending 
t\[indle and l{,ooth's model to allow R)r relalion- 
ships such as tlml~ I)e.tweell the verb and the' ob- 
ject o\[' the preposition would i:esult ill too large 
a. parameter spa.ce, given ~my realistic quantity of 
traiuing data. Another prol)lem of the method, 
shared by ma.ny statistical approaches, is that 
the. model ~(:quired (Inring training is rel)reser~ted 
in a huge, t~d)le of probabilities, pl:ecludiug any 
stra.ightf'orward analysis of its workings.

are attached to the object, noun. 2 This is tile at- 
tachment predicted by right association (Kim73). 
The allowable transforlnations are described 
by the following templates: 
? Change the attachment location from X to Y if: 
- n l i sW 
- n2 is W 
- v isW 
-- p is W 
- n l  is W1 and n2 is W2 
- n l  i sWl  andv isW2 
Here "from X to Y" can be either "from nl  to v" 
or "from v to nl ,"  W (W1, W2, etc.) can be any 
word, and the ellipsis indicates that the complete 
set of transformations permits matching on any 
combination of values for v, n l ,  p, and n2, with 
the exception of patterns that specify vahms for all 
four. For example, one allowable transformation 
would be 
Change the attachment location from nl  to v 
if p is "until". 
Learning proceeds as follows. First, the train- 
ing set is processed according to the start state 
annotator, in this case attaching all prepositional 
phrases low (attached to nl) .  Then, in essence, 
each possible transtbrmation is scored by apply- 
ing it to the corpus and cornputing the reduction 
(or increase) in error rate. in reality, the search 
is data driven, and so the vast majority of al- 
lowable transformations are not examined. The 
best-scoring transformation then becomes the first 
transformation i the learned list. It is applied to 
the training corpus, and learning continues on the 
modified corpus. This process is iterated until no 
rule can he found that reduces the error rate. 
In the experiment, a tol, al of 471 transfor- 
mations were learned - -  Figure 3 shows the first 
twenty. 3 Initial accuracy on the test set is 64.0% 
when prepositional phrases are always attached to 
the object noun. After applying the transforma- 
tions, accuracy increases to 80.8%. Figure 2 shows 
a plot of test-set accuracy as a function of the 
nulnber of training instances. It is interesting to 
note that the accuracy curve has not yet, reached a
2If it is the case that attaching to the verb would 
be a better start state in some corpora, this decision 
could be parameterized. 
ZIn transformation #8, word token amount appears 
because it was used as the head noun for noun phrases 
representing percentage amounts, e.g. "5%." The rule 
captures the very regular appearance in the Penn Tree- 
bank Wall Street Journal corpus of parses like Sales for 
the yea," \[v'P rose \[Np5Yo\]\[pP in fiscal 1988\]\].

Adding Word Class In format ion  
In the above experiment, all trans\[brmations are. 
triggered hy words or groups of words, and it is 
surprising that good performance is achieved even 
in spite of the inevitable sparse data problems. 
There are a number of ways to address the sparse 
data problem. One of the obvious ways, mapping 
words to part of speech, seerns unlikely to help. h> 
stead, semanl, ic class information is an attracLive 
alternative. 
We incorporated the idea of using semantic ino 
tbrmation in the lbllowing way. Using the Word~ 
Net noun hierarchy (Milg0), each noun in  the 
ffa{ning and test corpus was associated with a set 
containing the noun itself ph.ts the name of every 
semantic lass that noun appears in (if any). 4 The 
transformation template is modified so that in ad- 
dition to asking if a nmm matches ome word W, 
4Class names corresponded to unique "synonynl 
set" identifiers within the WordNet noun database. 
A noun "appears in" a class if it falls within the hy- 
ponym (IS-A) tree below that class. In the experiments 
reported here we used WordNet version :l.2.

Figure 5: Comparing l{esults in PP Attachment. 
In order to compare the two approaches, we 
reimplemen:ed the ~flgorithm fi'om (IIR.91) and 
tested it using the same training and test set 
used for the above experiments. Doing so re- 
sull;ed in an attachment accuracy of 70.4%. Next, 
the training set was expanded to include not only 
the cases o\[' ambiguous attachment \]Fonnd in the 
parsed Wall Street Journal corpus, as before, but 
also all the unambiguous prepositional phrase at- 
tachments tbnnd in the corpus, as well (contiml- 
ing to exclnde the tesl, set, of course). Accuracy 
improved to 75.8% r using the larger training set, 
still significantly lower than accuracy obtained us-- 
lag tam tl:ansformal;ion-based approach. The t.ech- 
nique described in (Res93b, 1{1t93), which com- 
bined Hindle and Rooth's lexical association tech- 
nique with a WordNet-based conceptual associa- 
tion measure, resulted in an accuracy of 76.0%, 
also lower than the results obtained using trans- 
formations. 
Since llindle and Rooth's approach does 
not make reference to n2, we re-ran the 
transformation-learner disalk)wing all transforma- 
tions that make reference ~o n2. Doing so resulted 
in an accuracy of 79.2%. See figure 5 h)r a sun> 
mary of results. 
It is possihle Lo compare; the results described 
here with a somewhat similar approach devel-. 
oped independently by Ratnaparkhi  and I/,oukos 
(l{R94), since they also used training and test datt~ 
drawn from the Penn Treebank's Wall Street Jour- 
nal corpus. Instead of' using mammlly coustructed 
lexical classes, they nse word classes arrived at via 
mutmd information clustering in a training corpus 
(BDd+92), resulting in a representation i which 
each word is represented by a sequence of bits. 
As in the experiments here, their statistical model 
also makes use of a 4-tuple context (v, c<l, p, n2), 
and can use the identit.ies of the words, class inl'or- 
marion (tbr them, wdues of any of the class bits),
