Abstract
This paper presents the results of the
WMT09 shared tasks, which included a
translation task, a system combination
task, and an evaluation task. We con-
ducted a large-scale manual evaluation of
87 machine translation systems and 22
system combination entries. We used the
ranking of these systems to measure how
strongly automatic metrics correlate with
human judgments of translation quality,
for more than 20 metrics. We present a
new evaluation technique whereby system
output is edited and judged for correctness.
1 Introduction
This paper presents the results of the shared tasks
of the 2009 EACL Workshop on Statistical Ma-
chine Translation, which builds on three previ-
ous workshops (Koehn and Monz, 2006; Callison-
Burch et al, 2007; Callison-Burch et al, 2008).
There were three shared tasks this year: a transla-
tion task between English and five other European
languages, a task to combine the output of multiple
machine translation systems, and a task to predict
human judgments of translation quality using au-
tomatic evaluation metrics. The performance on
each of these shared task was determined after a
comprehensive human evaluation.
There were a number of differences between
this year?s workshop and last year?s workshop:
? Larger training sets ? In addition to annual
increases in the Europarl corpus, we released
a French-English parallel corpus verging on 1
billion words. We also provided large mono-
lingual training sets for better language mod-
eling of the news translation task.
? Reduced number of conditions ? Previ-
ous workshops had many conditions: 10
language pairs, both in-domain and out-of-
domain translation, and three types of man-
ual evaluation. This year we eliminated
the in-domain Europarl test set and defined
sentence-level ranking as the primary type of
manual evaluation.
? Editing to evaluate translation quality ?
Beyond ranking the output of translation sys-
tems, we evaluated translation quality by hav-
ing people edit the output of systems. Later,
we asked annotators to judge whether those
edited translations were correct when shown
the source and reference translation.
The primary objectives of this workshop are to
evaluate the state of the art in machine transla-
tion, to disseminate common test sets and pub-
lic training data with published performance num-
bers, and to refine evaluation methodologies for
machine translation. All of the data, translations,
and human judgments produced for our workshop
are publicly available.1 We hope they form a
valuable resource for research into statistical ma-
chine translation, system combination, and auto-
matic evaluation of translation quality.
2 Overview of the shared translation and
system combination tasks
The workshop examined translation between En-
glish and five other languages: German, Spanish,
French, Czech, and Hungarian. We created a test
set for each language pair by translating news-
paper articles. We additionally provided training
data and a baseline system.

2.1 Test data
The test data for this year?s task was created by
hiring people to translate news articles that were
drawn from a variety of sources during the pe-
riod from the end of September to mid-October
of 2008. A total of 136 articles were selected, in
roughly equal amounts from a variety of Czech,
English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian and
Spanish news sites:2
Hungarian: hvg.hu (10), Napi (2), MNO (4),
Ne?pszabadsa?g (4)
Czech: iHNed.cz (3), iDNES.cz (4), Li-
dovky.cz (3), aktua?lne?.cz (2), Novinky (1)
French: dernieresnouvelles (1), Le Figaro (2),
Les Echos (4), Liberation (4), Le Devoir (9)
Spanish: ABC.es (11), El Mundo (12)
English: BBC (11), New York Times (6), Times
of London (4),
German: Su?ddeutsche Zeitung (3), Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung (3), Spiegel (8), Welt (3)
Italian: ADN Kronos (5), Affari Italiani (2),
ASCA (1), Corriere della Sera (4), Il Sole 24
ORE (1), Il Quotidiano (1), La Republica (8)
Note that Italian translation was not one of this
year?s official translation tasks.
The translations were created by the members
of EuroMatrix consortium who hired a mix of
professional and non-professional translators. All
translators were fluent or native speakers of both
languages. Although we made efforts to proof-
read all translations, many sentences still contain
minor errors and disfluencies. All of the transla-
tions were done directly, and not via an interme-
diate language. For instance, each of the 20 Hun-
garian articles were translated directly into Czech,
English, French, German, Italian and Spanish.
The total cost of creating the test sets consisting
of roughly 80,000 words across 3027 sentences in
seven languages was approximately 31,700 euros
(around 39,800 dollars at current exchange rates,
or slightly more than $0.08/word).
Previous evaluations additionally used test sets
drawn from the Europarl corpus. Our rationale be-
hind discontinuing the use of Europarl as a test set
was that it overly biases towards statistical systems
that were trained on this particular domain, and

tag gives the source and the date for each document in the
test set, and the origlang tag indicates the original source
language.
that European Parliament proceedings were less of
general interest than news stories. We focus on a
single task since the use of multiple test sets in the
past spread our resources too thin, especially in the
manual evaluation.
2.2 Training data
As in past years we provided parallel corpora to
train translation models, monolingual corpora to
train language models, and development sets to
tune parameters. Some statistics about the train-
ing materials are given in Figure 1.
109 word parallel corpus
To create the large French-English parallel cor-
pus, we conducted a targeted web crawl of bilin-
gual web sites. These sites came from a variety of
sources including the Canadian government, the
European Union, the United Nations, and other
international organizations. The crawl yielded on
the order of 40 million files, consisting of more
than 1TB of data. Pairs of translated documents
were identified using a set of simple heuristics to
transform French URLs into English URLs (for in-
stance, by replacing fr with en). Documents that
matched were assumed to be translations of each
other.
All HTML and PDF documents were converted
into plain text, which yielded 2 million French
files paired with their English equivalents. Text
files were split so that they contained one sen-
tence per line and had markers between para-
graphs. They were sentence-aligned in batches of
10,000 document pairs, using a sentence aligner
that incorporates IBM Model 1 probabilities in ad-
dition to sentence lengths (Moore, 2002). The
document-aligned corpus contained 220 million
segments with 2.9 billion words on the French side
and 215 million segments with 2.5 billion words
on the English side. After sentence alignment,
there were 177 million sentence pairs with 2.5 bil-
lion French words and 2.2 billion English words.
The sentence-aligned corpus was cleaned to re-
move sentence pairs which consisted only of num-
bers or paragraph markers, or where the French
and English sentences were identical. The later
step helped eliminate documents that were not
actually translated, which was necessary because
we did not perform language identification. After
cleaning, the parallel corpus contained 105 million
sentence pairs with 2 billion French words and 1.8
billion English words.

In addition to cleaning the sentence-aligned par-
allel corpus we also de-duplicated the corpus, re-
moving all sentence pairs that occured more than
once in the parallel corpus. Many of the docu-
ments gathered in our web crawl were duplicates
or near duplicates, and a lot of the text is repeated,
as with web site navigation. We further elimi-
nated sentence pairs that varied from previous sen-
tences by only numbers, which helped eliminate
template web pages such as expense reports. We
used a Bloom Filter (Talbot and Osborne, 2007) to
do de-duplication, so it may have discarded more
sentence pairs than strictly necessary. After de-
duplication, the parallel corpus contained 28 mil-
lion sentence pairs with 0.8 billion French words
and 0.7 billion English words.
Monolingual news corpora
We have crawled the news sources that were the
basis of our test sets (and a few more additional
sources) since August 2007. This allowed us to
assemble large corpora in the target domain to be
mainly used as training data for language mod-
eling. We collected texts from the beginning of
our data collection period to one month before the
test set period, segmented these into sentences and
randomized the order of the sentences to obviate
copyright concerns.
2.3 Baseline system
To lower the barrier of entry for newcomers to the
field, we provided Moses, an open source toolkit
for phrase-based statistical translation (Koehn et
al., 2007). The performance of this baseline sys-
tem is similar to the best submissions in last year?s
shared task. Twelve participating groups used the
Moses toolkit for the development of their system.
2.4 Submitted systems
We received submissions from 22 groups from
20 institutions, as listed in Table 1, a similar
turnout to last year?s shared task. Of the 20
groups that participated with regular system sub-
missions in last year?s shared task, 12 groups re-
turned this year. A major hurdle for many was
a DARPA/GALE evaluation that occurred at the
same time as this shared task.
We also evaluated 7 commercial rule-based MT
systems, and Google?s online statistical machine
translation system. We note that Google did not
submit an entry itself. Its entry was created by
the WMT09 organizers using Google?s online sys-
tem.3 In personal correspondence, Franz Och
clarified that the online system is different from
Google?s research system in that it runs at faster
speeds at the expense of somewhat lower transla-
tion quality. On the other hand, the training data
used by Google is unconstrained, which means
that it may have an advantage compared to the re-
search systems evaluated in this workshop, since
they were trained using only the provided materi-
als.
2.5 System combination
In total, we received 87 primary system submis-
sions along with 42 secondary submissions. These
were made available to participants in the sys-
tem combination shared task. Based on feedback
that we received on last year?s system combina-
tion task, we provided two additional resources to
participants:
? Development set: We reserved 25 articles
to use as a dev set for system combina-
tion (details of the set are given in Table
1). These were translated by all participating
sites, and distributed to system combination
participants along with reference translations.
? n-best translations: We requested n-best
lists from sites whose systems could produce
them. We received 25 100-best lists accom-
panying the primary system submissions, and
5 accompanying the secondary system sub-
missions.
In addition to soliciting system combination en-
tries for each of the language pairs, we treated sys-
tem combination as a way of doing multi-source
translation, following Schroeder et al (2009). For
the multi-source system combination task, we pro-
vided all 46 primary system submissions from any
language into English, along with an additional 32
secondary systems.
Table 2 lists the six participants in the system
combination task.
3 Human evaluation
As with past workshops, we placed greater em-
phasis on the human evaluation than on the auto-
matic evaluation metric scores. It is our contention

that automatic measures are an imperfect substi-
tute for human assessment of translation quality.
Therefore, we define the manual evaluation to be
primary, and use the human judgments to validate
automatic metrics.
Manual evaluation is time consuming, and it re-
quires a large effort to conduct it on the scale of
our workshop. We distributed the workload across
a number of people, including shared-task partic-
ipants, interested volunteers, and a small number
of paid annotators. More than 160 people partic-
ipated in the manual evaluation, with 100 people
putting in more than an hour?s worth of effort, and
30 putting in more than four hours. A collective
total of 479 hours of labor was invested.
We asked people to evaluate the systems? output
in two different ways:
? Ranking translated sentences relative to each
other. This was our official determinant of
translation quality.
? Editing the output of systems without dis-
playing the source or a reference translation,
and then later judging whether edited transla-
tions were correct.
The total number of judgments collected for the
different modes of annotation is given in Table 3.
In all cases, the output of the various translation
outputs were judged on equal footing; the output
of system combinations was judged alongside that
of the individual system, and the constrained and
unconstrained systems were judged together.
3.1 Ranking translations of sentences
Ranking translations relative to each other is a rea-
sonably intuitive task. We therefore kept the in-
structions simple:
Rank translations from Best to Worst rel-
ative to the other choices (ties are al-
lowed).
In our the manual evaluation, annotators were
shown at most five translations at a time. For most
language pairs there were more than 5 systems
submissions. We did not attempt to get a com-
plete ordering over the systems, and instead relied
on random selection and a reasonably large sample
size to make the comparisons fair.
Relative ranking is our official evaluation met-
ric. Individual systems and system combinations
are ranked based on how frequently they were
judged to be better than or equal to any other sys-
tem. The results of this are reported in Section 4.
Appendix A provides detailed tables that contain
pairwise comparisons between systems.
3.2 Editing machine translation output
We experimented with a new type of evaluation
this year where we asked judges to edit the output
of MT systems. We did not show judges the refer-
ence translation, which makes our edit-based eval-
uation different than the Human-targeted Trans-
lation Error Rate (HTER) measure used in the
DARPA GALE program (NIST, 2008). Rather
than asking people to make the minimum number
of changes to the MT output in order capture the
same meaning as the reference, we asked them to
6
edit the translation to be as fluent as possible with-
out seeing the reference. Our hope was that this
would reflect people?s understanding of the out-
put.
The instructions that we gave our judges were
the following:
Correct the translation displayed, mak-
ing it as fluent as possible. If no correc-
tions are needed, select ?No corrections
needed.? If you cannot understand the
sentence well enough to correct it, select
?Unable to correct.?
Each translated sentence was shown in isolation
without any additional context. A screenshot is
shown in Figure 2.
Since we wanted to prevent judges from see-
ing the reference before editing the translations,
we split the test set between the sentences used
in the ranking task and the editing task (because
they were being conducted concurrently). More-
over, annotators edited only a single system?s out-
put for one source sentence to ensure that their un-
derstanding of it would not be influenced by an-
other system?s output.
3.3 Judging the acceptability of edited output
Halfway through the manual evaluation period, we
stopped collecting edited translations, and instead
asked annotators to do the following:
Indicate whether the edited transla-
tions represent fully fluent and meaning-
equivalent alternatives to the reference
sentence. The reference is shown with
context, the actual sentence is bold.
In addition to edited translations, unedited items
that were either marked as acceptable or as incom-
prehensible were also shown. Judges gave a sim-
ple yes/no indication to each item. A screenshot is
shown in Figure 3.
3.4 Inter- and Intra-annotator agreement
In order to measure intra-annotator agreement
10% of the items were repeated and evaluated
twice by each judge. In order to measure inter-
annotator agreement 40% of the items were ran-
domly drawn from a common pool that was shared
across all annotators so that we would have items
that were judged by multiple annotators.
INTER-ANNOTATOR AGREEMENT
Evaluation type P (A) P (E) K
Sentence ranking .549 .333 .323

INTRA-ANNOTATOR AGREEMENT
Evaluation type P (A) P (E) K
Sentence ranking .707 .333 .561
Yes/no to edited output .866 .5 .732
Table 4: Inter- and intra-annotator agreement for
the two types of manual evaluation
We measured pairwise agreement among anno-
tators using the kappa coefficient (K) which is de-
fined as
K =
P (A)? P (E)
1? P (E)
where P (A) is the proportion of times that the an-
notators agree, and P (E) is the proportion of time
that they would agree by chance.
For inter-annotator agreement we calculated
P (A) for the yes/no judgments by examining all
items that were annotated by two or more anno-
tators, and calculating the proportion of time they
assigned identical scores to the same items. For
the ranking tasks we calculated P (A) by examin-
ing all pairs of systems which had been judged by
two or more judges, and calculated the proportion
of time that they agreed that A > B, A = B, or
A < B. Intra-annotator agreement was computed
similarly, but we gathered items that were anno-
tated on multiple occasions by a single annotator.
Table 4 gives K values for inter-annotator and
intra-annotator agreement. These give an indi-
cation of how often different judges agree, and
how often single judges are consistent for repeated
judgments, respectively. The interpretation of
Kappa varies, but according to Landis and Koch
(1977), 0 ? .2 is slight, .2 ? .4 is fair, .4 ? .6 is
moderate, .6? .8 is substantial and the rest almost
perfect.
Based on these interpretations the agreement for
yes/no judgments is moderate for inter-annotator
agreement and substantial for intra-annotator
agreement, but the inter-annotator agreement for
sentence level ranking is only fair.
We analyzed two possible strategies for improv-
ing inter-annotator agreement on the ranking task:
First, we tried discarding initial judgments to give

annotators a chance to learn to how to perform
the task. Second, we tried disregarding annota-
tors who have very low agreement with others, by
throwing away judgments for the annotators with
the lowest judgments.
Figures 4 and 5 show how the K values im-
prove for intra- and inter-annotator agreement un-
der these two strategies, and what percentage of
the judgments are retained as more annotators are
removed, or as the initial learning period is made
longer. It seems that the strategy of removing the
worst annotators is the best in terms of improv-
ing inter-annotator K, while retaining most of the
judgments. If we remove the 33 judges with the
worst agreement, we increase the inter-annotator
K from fair to moderate, and still retain 60% of
the data.
For the results presented in the rest of the paper,
we retain all judgments.
4 Translation task results
We used the results of the manual evaluation to
analyze the translation quality of the different sys-
tems that were submitted to the workshop. In our
analysis, we aimed to address the following ques-
tions:
? Which systems produced the best translation
quality for each language pair?
? Did the system combinations produce better
translations than individual systems?
? Which of the systems that used only the pro-
vided training materials produced the best
translation quality?
Table 6 shows best individual systems. We de-
fine the best systems as those which had no other
system that was statistically significantly better
than them under the Sign Test at p ? 0.1.4 Multi-
ple systems are listed for many language pairs be-
cause it was not possible to draw a statistically sig-
nificant difference between the systems. Commer-
cial translation software (including Google, Sys-
tran, Morphologic, PCTrans, Eurotran XP, and
anonymized RBMT providers) did well in each of
the language pairs. Research systems that utilized
4In one case this definition meant that the system that was
ranked the highest overall was not considered to be one of
the best systems. For German-English translation RBMT5
was ranked highest overall, but was statistically significantly
worse than RBMT2.
only the provided data did as well as commercial
vendors in half of the language pairs.
The table also lists the best systems among
those which used only the provided materials.
To determine this decision we excluded uncon-
strained systems which employed significant ex-
ternal resources. Specifically, we ruled out all of
the commercial systems, since Google has access
to significantly greater data sources for its statisti-
cal system, and since the commercial RBMT sys-
tems utilize knowledge sources not available to
other workshop participants. The remaining sys-
tems were research systems that employ statisti-
cal models. We were able to draw distinctions
between half of these for each of the language
pairs. There are some borderline cases, for in-
stance LIMSI only used additional monolingual
training resources, and LIUM/Systran used addi-
tional translation dictionaries as well as additional
monolingual resources.
Table 5 summarizes the performance of the
system combination entries by listing the best
ranked combinations, and by indicating whether
they have a statistically significant difference with
the best individual systems. In general, system
combinations performed as well as the best indi-
vidual systems, but not statistically significantly
better than them. Moreover, it was hard to draw
a distinction between the different system combi-
nation strategies themselves. There are a number
of possibilities as to why we failed to find signifi-
cant differences:
? The number of judgments that we collected
were not sufficient to find a difference. Al-
though we collected several thousand judg-
ments for each language pair, most pairs of
systems were judged together fewer than 100
times.
? It is possible that the best performing indi-
vidual systems were sufficiently better than
the other systems and that it is difficult to im-
prove on them by combining them.
? Individual systems could have been weighted
incorrectly during the development stage,
which could happen if the automatic evalu-
ation metrics scores on the dev set did not
strongly correlate with human judgments.
? The lack of distinction between different
combinations could be due to the fact that

there is significant overlap in the strategies
that they employ.
Improved system combination warrants further in-
vestigation. We would suggest collecting addi-
tional judgments, and doing oracle experiments
where the contributions of individual systems are
weighted according to human judgments of their
quality.
Understandability
Our hope is that judging the acceptability of edited
output as discussed in Section 3 gives some indi-
cation of how often a system?s output was under-
standable. Figure 6 gives the percentage of times
that each system?s edited output was judged to
be acceptable (the percentage also factors in in-
stances when judges were unable to improve the
output because it was incomprehensible).
The edited output of the best perform-
ing systems under this evaluation model were
deemed acceptable around 50% of the time
for French-English, English-French, English-
Spanish, German-English, and English-German.
For Spanish-English the edited output of the best
system was acceptable around 40% of the time, for
English-Czech it was 30% and for Czech-English
and Hungarian-English it was around 20%.
This style of manual evaluation is experimental
and should not be taken to be authoritative. Some
caveats about this measure:
? Editing translations without context is diffi-
cult, so the acceptability rate is probably an
underestimate of how understandable a sys-
tem actually is.
? There are several sources of variance that are
difficult to control for: some people are better
at editing, and some sentences are more dif-
ficult to edit. Therefore, variance in the un-
derstandability of systems is difficult to pin
down.
? The acceptability measure does not strongly
correlate with the more established method of
ranking translations relative to each other for
all the language pairs.5
Please also note that the number of corrected
translations per system are very low for some
language pairs, as low as 23 corrected sentences
per system for the language pair English?French.

two types of manual evaluation rank systems are .67 for de-
en, .67 for fr-en, .06 for es-en, .50 for cz-en, .36 for hu-en,
.65 for en-de, .02 for en-fr, -.6 for en-es, and .94 for en-cz.

Systems are listed in the order of how often their translations were ranked higher than or equal to any
other system. Ties are broken by direct comparison.
C? indicates constrained condition, meaning only using the supplied training data and possibly standard
monolingual linguistic tools (but no additional corpora).
? indicates a win in the category, meaning that no other system is statistically significantly better at
p-level?0.1 in pairwise comparison.
? indicates a constrained win, no other constrained system is statistically better.
For all pairwise comparisons between systems, please check the appendix.

Given these low numbers, the numbers presented
in Figure 6 should not be read as comparisons be-
tween systems, but rather viewed as indicating the
state of machine translation for different language
pairs.
5 Shared evaluation task overview
In addition to allowing us to analyze the transla-
tion quality of different systems, the data gath-
ered during the manual evaluation is useful for
validating the automatic evaluation metrics. Last
year, NIST began running a similar ?Metrics
for MAchine TRanslation? challenge (Metrics-
MATR), and presented their findings at a work-
shop at AMTA (Przybocki et al, 2008).
In this year?s shared task we evaluated a number
of different automatic metrics:
? Bleu (Papineni et al, 2002)?Bleu remains
the de facto standard in machine translation
evaluation. It calculates n-gram precision and
a brevity penalty, and can make use of multi-
ple reference translations as a way of captur-
ing some of the allowable variation in trans-
lation. We use a single reference translation
in our experiments.
? Meteor (Agarwal and Lavie, 2008)?Meteor
measures precision and recall for unigrams
and applies a fragmentation penalty. It uses
flexible word matching based on stemming
and WordNet-synonymy. meteor-ranking is
optimized for correlation with ranking judg-
ments.
? Translation Error Rate (Snover et al,
2006)?TER calculates the number of ed-
its required to change a hypothesis transla-
tion into a reference translation. The possi-
ble edits in TER include insertion, deletion,
and substitution of single words, and an edit
which moves sequences of contiguous words.
Two variants of TER are also included: TERp
(Snover et al, 2009), a new version which in-
troduces a number of different features, and
(Bleu ? TER)/2, a combination of Bleu and
Translation Edit Rate.
? MaxSim (Chan and Ng, 2008)?MaxSim
calculates a similarity score by comparing
items in the translation against the reference.
Unlike most metrics which do strict match-
ing, MaxSim computes a similarity score
for non-identical items. To find a maxi-
mum weight matching that matches each sys-
tem item to at most one reference item, the
items are then modeled as nodes in a bipar-
tite graph.
? wcd6p4er (Leusch and Ney, 2008)?a mea-
sure based on cder with word-based substitu-
tion costs. Leusch and Ney (2008) also sub-
mitted two contrastive metrics: bleusp4114,
a modified version of BLEU-S (Lin and
Och, 2004), with tuned n-gram weights, and
bleusp, with constant weights. wcd6p4er
is an error measure and bleusp is a quality
score.
? RTE (Pado et al, 2009)?The RTE metric
follows a semantic approach which applies
recent work in rich textual entailment to the
problem of MT evaluation. Its predictions are
based on a regression model over a feature
set adapted from an entailment systems. The
features primarily model alignment quality
and (mis-)matches of syntactic and semantic
structures.
? ULC (Gime?nez and Ma`rquez, 2008)?ULC
is an arithmetic mean over other automatic
metrics. The set of metrics used include
Rouge, Meteor, measures of overlap between
constituent parses, dependency parses, se-
mantic roles, and discourse representations.
The ULC metric had the strongest correlation
with human judgments in WMT08 (Callison-
Burch et al, 2008).
? wpF and wpBleu (Popovic and Ney, 2009) -
These metrics are based on words and part of
speech sequences. wpF is an n-gram based F-
measure which takes into account both word
n-grams and part of speech n-grams. wp-
BLEU is a combnination of the normal Blue
score and a part of speech-based Bleu score.
? SemPOS (Kos and Bojar, 2009) ? the Sem-
POS metric computes overlapping words, as
defined in (Gime?nez and Ma`rquez, 2007),
with respect to their semantic part of speech.
Moreover, it does not use the surface repre-
sentation of words but their underlying forms
obtained from the TectoMT framework.

Figure 6: The percent of time that each system?s edited output was judged to be an acceptable translation.
These numbers also include judgments of the system?s output when it was marked either incomprehen-
sible or acceptable and left unedited. Note that the reference translation was edited alongside the system
outputs. Error bars show one positive and one negative standard deviation for the systems in that lan-
guage pair.

5.1 Measuring system-level correlation
We measured the correlation of the automatic met-
rics with the human judgments of translation qual-
ity at the system-level using Spearman?s rank cor-
relation coefficient ?. We converted the raw scores
assigned to each system into ranks. We assigned
a human ranking to the systems based on the per-
cent of time that their translations were judged to
be better than or equal to the translations of any
other system in the manual evaluation.
When there are no ties ? can be calculated using
the simplified equation:
? = 1?
6
?
d2i
n(n2 ? 1)
where di is the difference between the rank for
systemi and n is the number of systems. The pos-
sible values of ? range between 1 (where all sys-
tems are ranked in the same order) and ?1 (where
the systems are ranked in the reverse order). Thus
an automatic evaluation metric with a higher abso-
lute value for ? is making predictions that are more
similar to the human judgments than an automatic
evaluation metric with a lower absolute ?.
5.2 Measuring sentence-level consistency
Because the sentence-level judgments collected
in the manual evaluation are relative judgments
rather than absolute judgments, it is not possi-
ble for us to measure correlation at the sentence-
level in the same way that previous work has done
(Kulesza and Shieber, 2004; Albrecht and Hwa,
2007a; Albrecht and Hwa, 2007b).
Rather than calculating a correlation coefficient
at the sentence-level we instead ascertained how
consistent the automatic metrics were with the hu-
man judgments. The way that we calculated con-
sistency was the following: for every pairwise
comparison of two systems on a single sentence by
a person, we counted the automatic metric as being
consistent if the relative scores were the same (i.e.
the metric assigned a higher score to the higher
ranked system). We divided this by the total num-
ber of pairwise comparisons to get a percentage.
Because the systems generally assign real num-
bers as scores, we excluded pairs that the human
annotators ranked as ties.

6 Evaluation task results
6.1 System-level correlation
Table 7 shows the correlation of automatic met-
rics when they rank systems that are translating
into English. Note that TERp, TER and wcd6p4er
are error metrics, so a negative correlation is bet-
ter for them. The strength of correlation varied for
the different language pairs. The automatic met-
rics were able to rank the French-English systems
reasonably well with correlation coefficients in the
range of .8 and .9. In comparison, metrics per-
formed worse for Hungarian-English, where half
of the systems had negative correlation. The ULC
metric once again had strongest correlation with
human judgments of translation quality. This was
followed closely by MaxSim and RTE, with Me-
teor and TERp doing respectably well in 4th and
5th place. Notably, Bleu and its variants were the
worst performing metrics in this translation direc-
tion.
Table 8 shows correlation for metrics which op-
erated on languages other than English. Most of
the best performing metrics that operate on En-
glish do not work for foreign languages, because
they perform some linguistic analysis or rely on
a resource like WordNet. For translation into for-
eign languages TERp was the best system overall.
The wpBleu and wpF metrics also did extremely
well, performing the best in the language pairs that
they were applied to. wpBleu and wpF were not
applied to Czech because the authors of the met-
ric did not have a Czech tagger. English-German
proved to be the most problematic language pair
to automatically evaluate, with all of the metrics
having a negative correlation except wpBleu and
TER.
Table 9 gives detailed results for how well vari-
ations on a number of automatic metrics do for
the task of ranking five English-Czech systems.6
These systems were submitted by Kos and Bojar
(2009), and they investigate the effects of using
Prague Dependency Treebank annotations during
automatic evaluation. They linearizing the Czech
trees and evaluated either the lemmatized forms of
the Czech (lemma) read off the trees or the Tec-
togrammatical form which retained only lemma-
tized content words (tecto). The table also demon-
strates SemPOS, Meteor, and GTM perform better
on Czech than many other metrics.
6.2 Sentence-level consistency
Tables 10 and 11 show the percent of times that the
metrics? scores were consistent with human rank-
ings of every pair of translated sentences.7 Since
we eliminated sentence pairs that were judged to
be equal, the random baseline for this task is 50%.
Many metrics failed to reach the baseline (includ-
ing most metrics in the out-of-English direction).
This indicates that sentence-level evaluation of
machine translation quality is very difficult. RTE
and ULC again do the best overall for the into-
English direction. They are followed closely by
wpF and wcd6p4er, which considerably improve
their performance over their system-level correla-
tions.
We tried a variant on measuring sentence-level
consistency. Instead of using the scores assigned
to each individual sentence, we used the system-
level score and applied it to every sentence that
was produced by that system. These can be
thought of as a metric?s prior expectation about
how a system should preform, based on their per-
formance on the whole data set. Tables 12 and 13
show that using the system-level scores in place
of the sentence-level scores results in considerably
higher consistency with human judgments. This
suggests an interesting line of research for improv-
ing sentence-level predictions by using the perfor-
mance on a larger data set as a prior.
7 Summary
As in previous editions of this workshop we car-
ried out an extensive manual and automatic eval-
uation of machine translation performance for
translating from European languages into English,
6PCTRANS was excluded from the English-Czech systems
because its SGML file was malformed.
7Not all metrics entered into the sentence-level task.

and vice versa.
The number of participants remained stable
compared to last year?s WMT workshop, with
22 groups from 20 institutions participating in
WMT09. This year?s evaluation also included 7
commercial rule-based MT systems and Google?s
online statistical machine translation system.
Compared to previous years, we have simpli-
fied the evaluation conditions by removing the in-
domain vs. out-of-domain distinction focusing on
news translations only. The main reason for this
was eliminating the advantage statistical systems
have with respect to test data that are from the
same domain as the training data.
Analogously to previous years, the main focus
of comparing the quality of different approaches
is on manual evaluation. Here, also, we reduced
the number of dimensions with respect to which
the different systems are compared, with sentence-
level ranking as the primary type of manual eval-
uation. In addition to the direct quality judgments
we also evaluated translation quality by having
people edit the output of systems and have as-
sessors judge the correctness of the edited output.
The degree to which users were able to edit the
translations (without having access to the source
sentence or reference translation) served as a mea-
sure of the overall comprehensibility of the trans-
lation.
Although the inter-annotator agreement in the
sentence-ranking evaluation is only fair (as mea-
sured by the Kappa score), agreement can be im-
proved by removing the first (up to 50) judgments
of each assessor, focusing on the judgments that
were made once the assessors are more familiar
with the task. Inter-annotator agreement with re-
spect to correctness judgments of the edited trans-
lations were higher (moderate), which is proba-
bly due to the simplified evaluation criterion (bi-
nary judgments versus rankings). Inter-annotator
agreement for both conditions can be increased
further by removing the judges with the worst
agreement. Intra-annotator agreement on the other
hand was considerably higher ranging between
moderate and substantial.
In addition to the manual evaluation criteria we
applied a large number of automated metrics to
see how they correlate with the human judgments.
There is considerably variation between the differ-
ent metrics and the language pairs under consid-
eration. As in WMT08, the ULC metric had the
highest overall correlation with human judgments
when translating into English, with MaxSim and
RTE following closely behind. TERp and wpBleu
were best when translating into other languages.
Automatically predicting human judgments at
the sentence-level proved to be quite challeng-
ing with many of the systems performing around
chance. We performed an analysis that showed
that if metrics? system-level scores are used in
place of their scores for individual sentences, that
they do quite a lot better. This suggests that prior
probabilities ought to be integrated into sentence-
level scoring.
All data sets generated by this workshop, in-
cluding the human judgments, system translations
and automatic scores, are publicly available for
other researchers to analyze.8

A Pairwise system comparisons by human judges
Tables 14?24 show pairwise comparisons between systems for each language pair. The numbers in each
of the tables? cells indicate the percentage of times that the system in that column was judged to be better
than the system in that row. Bolding indicates the winner of the two systems. The difference between
100 and the sum of the complimentary cells is the percent of time that the two systems were judged to
be equal.
Because there were so many systems and data conditions the significance of each pairwise compar-
ison needs to be quantified. We applied the Sign Test to measure which comparisons indicate genuine
differences (rather than differences that are attributable to chance). In the following tables ? indicates sta-
tistical significance at p ? 0.10, ? indicates statistical significance at p ? 0.05, and ? indicates statistical
significance at p ? 0.01, according to the Sign Test.
B Automatic scores
Tables 26 and 25 give the automatic scores for each of the systems.
