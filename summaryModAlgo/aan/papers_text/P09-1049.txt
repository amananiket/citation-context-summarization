Abstract
This paper proposes a novel framework
called bilingual co-training for a large-
scale, accurate acquisition method for
monolingual semantic knowledge. In
this framework, we combine the indepen-
dent processes of monolingual semantic-
knowledge acquisition for two languages
using bilingual resources to boost perfor-
mance. We apply this framework to large-
scale hyponymy-relation acquisition from
Wikipedia. Experimental results show
that our approach improved the F-measure
by 3.6?10.3%. We also show that bilin-
gual co-training enables us to build classi-
fiers for two languages in tandem with the
same combined amount of data as required
for training a single classifier in isolation
while achieving superior performance.
1 Motivation
Acquiring and accumulating semantic knowledge
are crucial steps for developing high-level NLP
applications such as question answering, although
it remains difficult to acquire a large amount of
highly accurate semantic knowledge. This pa-
per proposes a novel framework for a large-scale,
accurate acquisition method for monolingual se-
mantic knowledge, especially for semantic rela-
tions between nominals such as hyponymy and
meronymy. We call the framework bilingual co-
training.
The acquisition of semantic relations between
nominals can be seen as a classification task of se-
mantic relations ? to determine whether two nom-
inals hold a particular semantic relation (Girju et
al., 2007). Supervised learning methods, which
have often been applied to this classification task,
have shown promising results. In those methods,
however, a large amount of training data is usually
required to obtain high performance, and the high
costs of preparing training data have always been
a bottleneck.
Our research on bilingual co-training sprang
from a very simple idea: perhaps training data in a
language can be enlarged without much cost if we
translate training data in another language and add
the translation to the training data in the original
language. We also noticed that it may be possi-
ble to further enlarge the training data by trans-
lating the reliable part of the classification results
in another language. Since the learning settings
(feature sets, feature values, training data, corpora,
and so on) are usually different in two languages,
the reliable part in one language may be over-
lapped by an unreliable part in another language.
Adding the translated part of the classification re-
sults to the training data will improve the classifi-
cation results in the unreliable part. This process
can also be repeated by swapping the languages,
as illustrated in Figure 1. Actually, this is nothing
other than a bilingual version of co-training (Blum
and Mitchell, 1998).

Figure 1: Concept of bilingual co-training
Let us show an example in our current task:
hyponymy-relation acquisition from Wikipedia.
Our original approach for this task was super-
432
vised learning based on the approach proposed by
Sumida et al (2008), which was only applied for
Japanese and achieved around 80% in F-measure.
In their approach, a common substring in a hyper-
nym and a hyponym is assumed to be one strong
clue for recognizing that the two words constitute
a hyponymy relation. For example, recognizing a
proper hyponymy relation between two Japanese
words, (kouso meaning enzyme) and
 (kasuibunkaikouso meaning hydrolase), is
relatively easy because they share a common suf-
fix: kouso. On the other hand, judging whether
their English translations (enzyme and hydrolase)
have a hyponymy relation is probably more dif-
ficult since they do not share any substrings. A
classifier for Japanese will regard the hyponymy
relation as valid with high confidence, while a
classifier for English may not be so positive. In
this case, we can compensate for the weak part of
the English classifier by adding the English trans-
lation of the Japanese hyponymy relation, which
was recognized with high confidence, to the En-
glish training data.
In addition, if we repeat this process by swap-
ping English and Japanese, further improvement
may be possible. Furthermore, the reliable parts
that are automatically produced by a classifier can
be larger than manually tailored training data. If
this is the case, the effect of adding the transla-
tion to the training data can be quite large, and the
same level of effect may not be achievable by a
reasonable amount of labor for preparing the train-
ing data. This is the whole idea.
Through a series of experiments, this paper
shows that the above idea is valid at least for one
task: large-scale monolingual hyponymy-relation
acquisition from English and Japanese Wikipedia.
Experimental results showed that our method
based on bilingual co-training improved the per-
formance of monolingual hyponymy-relation ac-
quisition about 3.6?10.3% in the F-measure.
Bilingual co-training also enables us to build clas-
sifiers for two languages in tandem with the same
combined amount of data as would be required
for training a single classifier in isolation while
achieving superior performance.
People probably expect that a key factor in the
success of this bilingual co-training is how to
translate the training data. We actually did transla-
tion by a simple look-up procedure in the existing
translation dictionaries without any machine trans-
lation systems or disambiguation processes. De-
spite this simple approach, we obtained consistent
improvement in our task using various translation
dictionaries.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2
presents bilingual co-training, and Section 3 pre-
cisely describes our system. Section 4 describes
our experiments and presents results. Section 5
discusses related work. Conclusions are drawn
and future work is mentioned in Section 6.
2 Bilingual Co-Training
Let S and T be two different languages, and let
CL be a set of class labels to be obtained as a re-
sult of learning/classification. To simplify the dis-
cussion, we assume that a class label is binary; i.e.,
the classification results are ?yes? or ?no.? Thus,
CL = {yes, no}. Also, we denote the set of all
nonnegative real numbers by R+.
Assume X = XS ? XT is a set of instances in
languages S and T to be classified. In the con-
text of a hyponymy-relation acquisition task, the
instances are pairs of nominals. Then we assume
that classifier c assigns class label cl in CL and
confidence value r for assigning the label, i.e.,
c(x) = (x, cl, r), where x ? X , cl ? CL, and
r ? R+. Note that we used support vector ma-
chines (SVMs) in our experiments and (the abso-
lute value of) the distance between a sample and
the hyperplane determined by the SVMs was used
as confidence value r. The training data are de-
noted by L ? X?CL, and we denote the learning
by function LEARN ; if classifier c is trained by
training data L, then c = LEARN(L). Particu-
larly, we denote the training sets for S and T that
are manually prepared by LS and LT , respectively.
Also, bilingual instance dictionary DBI is defined
as the translation pairs of instances in XS and XT .
Thus, DBI = {(s, t)} ? XS ? XT . In the case
of hyponymy-relation acquisition in English and
Japanese, (s, t) ? DBI could be (s=(enzyme, hy-
drolase), t=( (meaning enzyme),
 (meaning hydrolase))).
Our bilingual co-training is given in Figure 2. In
the initial stage, c0S and c0T are learned with manu-
ally labeled instances LS and LT (lines 2?5). Then
ciS and ciT are applied to classify instances in XS
and XT (lines 6?7). Denote CRiS as a set of the
classification results of ciS on instances XS that is
not in LiS and is registered in DBI . Lines 10?18

beled instances to be added to a new training set
in T . TopN(CRiS) is a set of ciS(x), whose rS
is top-N highest in CRiS . (In our experiments,
N = 900.) During the selection, ciS acts as a
teacher and ciT as a student. The teacher instructs
his student in the class label of xT , which is actu-
ally a translation of xS by bilingual instance dic-
tionary DBI , through clS only if he can do it with
a certain level of confidence, say rS > ?, and
if one of two other condition meets (rT < ? or
clS = clT ). clS = clT is a condition to avoid
problems, especially when the student also has a
certain level of confidence in his opinion on a class
label but disagrees with the teacher: rT > ? and
clS 6= clT . In that case, the teacher does nothing
and ignores the instance. Condition rT < ? en-
ables the teacher to instruct his student in the class
label of xT in spite of their disagreement in a class
label. If every condition is satisfied, (xT , clS) is
added to existing labeled instances L(i+1)T . The
roles are reversed in lines 19?27 so that ciT be-
comes a teacher and ciS a student.
Similar to co-training (Blum and Mitchell,
1998), one classifier seeks another?s opinion to se-
lect new labeled instances. One main difference
between co-training and bilingual co-training is
the space of instances: co-training is based on dif-
ferent features of the same instances, and bilin-
gual co-training is based on different spaces of in-
stances divided by languages. Since some of the
instances in different spaces are connected by a
bilingual instance dictionary, they seem to be in
the same space. Another big difference lies in
the role of the two classifiers. The two classifiers
in co-training work on the same task, but those
in bilingual co-training do the same type of task
rather than the same task.
3 Acquisition of Hyponymy Relations
from Wikipedia
Our system, which acquires hyponymy relations
from Wikipedia based on bilingual co-training,
is described in Figure 3. The following three
main parts are described in this section: candidate
extraction, hyponymy-relation classification, and
bilingual instance dictionary construction.

as a source of hyponymy relations because it can
provide a huge amount of them (Sumida et al,
2008; Sumida and Torisawa, 2008)1, and recog-
nition of the layout structure is easy regardless of
languages. Every English and Japanese Wikipedia
article was transformed into a tree structure like
Figure 4, where layout items title, (sub)section
headings, and list items in an article were used
as nodes in a tree structure. Sumida et al (2008)
found that some pairs consisting of a node and one
of its descendants constituted a proper hyponymy
relation (e.g., (TIGER, SIBERIAN TIGER)), and
this could be a knowledge source of hyponymy
relation acquisition. A hyponymy-relation candi-
date is then extracted from the tree structure by re-
garding a node as a hypernym candidate and all
its subordinate nodes as hyponym candidates of
the hypernym candidate (e.g., (TIGER, TAXON-
OMY) and (TIGER, SIBERIAN TIGER) from Fig-
ure 4). 39 M English hyponymy-relation candi-
dates and 10 M Japanese ones were extracted from
Wikipedia. These candidates are classified into
proper hyponymy relations and others by using the
classifiers described below.
3.2 Hyponymy-Relation Classification
We use SVMs (Vapnik, 1995) as classifiers for
the classification of the hyponymy relations on the
hyponymy-relation candidates. Let hyper be a hy-
pernym candidate, hypo be a hyper?s hyponym
candidate, and (hyper, hypo) be a hyponymy-
relation candidate. The lexical, structure-based,
and infobox-based features of (hyper, hypo) in Ta-
ble 1 are used for building English and Japanese
classifiers. Note that SF

sets used in Sumida et al (2008). See Sum-
ida et al (2008) for more details. Lexical fea-
tures LF

?LF

are used to recognize the lexi-
cal evidence encoded in hyper and hypo for hy-
ponymy relations. For example, (hyper,hypo) is
often a proper hyponymy relation if hyper and
hypo share the same head morpheme or word.
In LF
1
and LF
2
, such information is provided
along with the words/morphemes and the parts of
speech of hyper and hypo, which can be multi-
word/morpheme nouns. TagChunk (Daume? III et
al., 2005) for English and MeCab (MeCab, 2008)
for Japanese were used to provide the lexical fea-
tures. Several simple lexical patterns2 were also
applied to hyponymy-relation candidates. For ex-
ample, ?List of artists? is converted into ?artists?
by lexical pattern ?list of X.? Hyponymy-relation
candidates whose hypernym candidate matches
such a lexical pattern are likely to be valid (e.g.,
(List of artists, Leonardo da Vinci)). We use LF
4
for dealing with these cases. If a typical or fre-
quently used section heading in a Wikipedia arti-
cle, such as ?History? or ?References,? is used as
a hyponym candidate in a hyponymy-relation can-
didate, the hyponymy-relation candidate is usually
not a hyponymy relation. LF
5
is used to recognize
these hyponymy-relation candidates.
Structure-based features are related to the
tree structure of Wikipedia articles from which
hyponymy-relation candidate (hyper,hypo) is ex-
tracted. SF
1
provides the distance between hyper
and hypo in the tree structure. SF
2
represents the
type of layout items from which hyper and hypo
are originated. These are the feature sets used in
Sumida et al (2008).
We also added some new items to the above
feature sets. SF
3
represents the types of tree
nodes including root, leaf, and others. For exam-
ple, (hyper,hypo) is seldom a hyponymy relation
if hyper is from a root node (or title) and hypo
is from a hyper?s child node (or section head-
ings). SF

represent the structural con-
texts of hyper and hypo in a tree structure. They
can provide evidence related to similar hyponymy-
relation candidates in the structural contexts.

Wikipedia infobox, a special kind of template, that
describes a tabular summary of an article subject
expressed by attribute-value pairs. An attribute
type coupled with the infobox name to which it
belongs provides the semantic properties of its
value that enable us to easily understand what
the attribute value means (Auer and Lehmann,
2007; Wu and Weld, 2007). For example, in-
fobox template City Japan in Wikipedia article
Kyoto contains several attribute-value pairs such
as ?Mayor=Daisaku Kadokawa? as attribute=its
value. What Daisaku Kadokawa, the attribute
value of mayor in the example, represents is hard
to understand alone if we lack knowledge, but
its attribute type, mayor, gives a clue?Daisaku
Kadokawa is a mayor related to Kyoto. These
semantic properties enable us to discover seman-
tic evidence for hyponymy relations. We ex-
tract triples (infobox name, attribute type, attribute
value) from the Wikipedia infoboxes and encode
such information related to hyper and hypo in our
feature set IF .3
3.3 Bilingual Instance Dictionary
Construction
Multilingual versions of Wikipedia articles are
connected by cross-language links and usually
have titles that are bilinguals of each other (Erd-
mann et al, 2008). English and Japanese articles
connected by a cross-language link are extracted
from Wikipedia, and their titles are regarded as
translation pairs4. The translation pairs between
3We obtained 1.6 M object-attribute-value triples in
Japanese and 5.9 M in English.
4197 K translation pairs were extracted.
English and Japanese terms are used for building
bilingual instance dictionary DBI for hyponymy-
relation acquisition, where DBI is composed of
translation pairs between English and Japanese
hyponymy-relation candidates5.
4 Experiments
We used the MAY 2008 version of English
Wikipedia and the JUNE 2008 version of
Japanese Wikipedia for our experiments. 24,000
hyponymy-relation candidates, randomly selected
in both languages, were manually checked to build
training, development, and test sets6. Around
8,000 hyponymy relations were found in the man-
ually checked data for both languages7. 20,000 of
the manually checked data were used as a train-
ing set for training the initial classifier. The rest
were equally divided into development and test
sets. The development set was used to select the
optimal parameters in bilingual co-training and the
test set was used to evaluate our system.
We used TinySVM (TinySVM, 2002) with a
polynomial kernel of degree 2 as a classifier. The
maximum iteration number in the bilingual co-
training was set as 100. Two parameters, ? and
TopN , were selected through experiments on the
development set. ? = 1 and TopN=900 showed
5We also used redirection links in English and Japanese
Wikipedia for recognizing the variations of terms when we
built a bilingual instance dictionary with Wikipedia cross-
language links.
6It took about two or three months to check them in each
language.
7Regarding a hyponymy relation as a positive sample and
the others as a negative sample for training SVMs, ?positive
sample:negative sample? was about 8,000:16,000=1:2
436
the best performance and were used as the optimal
parameter in the following experiments.
We conducted three experiments to show ef-
fects of bilingual co-training, training data size,
and bilingual instance dictionaries. In the first two
experiments, we experimented with a bilingual in-
stance dictionary derived from Wikipedia cross-
language links. Comparison among systems based
on three different bilingual instance dictionaries is
shown in the third experiment.
Precision (P ), recall (R), and F

-measure (F

),
as in Eq (1), were used as the evaluation measures,
where Rel represents a set of manually checked
hyponymy relations and HRbyS represents a set
of hyponymy-relation candidates classified as hy-
ponymy relations by the system:
P = |Rel ? HRbyS|/|HRbyS| (1)

Table 2 shows the comparison results of the four
systems. SYT represents the Sumida et al (2008)
system that we implemented and tested with the
same data as ours. INIT is a system based on ini-
tial classifier c0 in bilingual co-training. We trans-
lated training data in one language by using our
bilingual instance dictionary and added the trans-
lation to the existing training data in the other
language like bilingual co-training did. The size
of the English and Japanese training data reached
20,729 and 20,486. We trained initial classifier c0
with the new training data. TRAN is a system
based on the classifier. BICO is a system based
on bilingual co-training.
For Japanese, SYT showed worse performance
than that reported in Sumida et al (2008), proba-
bly due to the difference in training data size (ours
is 20,000 and Sumida et al (2008) was 29,900).
The size of the test data was also different ? ours
is 2,000 and Sumida et al (2008) was 1,000.
Comparison between INIT and SYT shows the
effect of SF

INIT consistently outperformed SYT, although the
difference was merely around 0.5?1.8% in F

.
BICO showed significant performance im-
provement (around 3.6?10.3% in F
1
) over SYT,
INIT, and TRAN regardless of the language. Com-
parison between TRAN and BICO showed that
bilingual co-training is useful for enlarging the
training data and that the performance gain by
bilingual co-training cannot be achieved by sim-
ply translating the existing training data.

ends around 55,000 in Japanese and 62,000 in En-
glish. As the training data size increases, the F
1
curves tend to go upward in both languages. This
indicates that the two classifiers cooperate well
to boost their performance through bilingual co-
training.
We recognized 5.4 M English and 2.41 M
Japanese hyponymy relations from the classifi-
cation results of BICO on all hyponymy-relation
candidates in both languages.
4.2 Effect of Training Data Size
We performed two tests to investigate the effect of
the training data size on bilingual co-training. The
first test posed the following question: ?If we build
2n training samples by hand and the building cost
is the same in both languages, which is better from
the monolingual aspects: 2n monolingual training
samples or n bilingual training samples?? Table 3
and Figure 6 show the results.
437
In INIT-E and INIT-J, a classifier in each lan-
guage, which was trained with 2n monolingual
training samples, did not learn through bilingual
co-training. In BICO-E and BICO-J, bilingual co-
training was applied to the initial classifiers trained
with n training samples in both languages. As
shown in Table 3, BICO, with half the size of the
training samples used in INIT, always performed
better than INIT in both languages. This indicates
that bilingual co-training enables us to build clas-
sifiers for two languages in tandem with the same
combined amount of data as required for training
a single classifier in isolation while achieving su-
perior performance.

with one strong and one weak classifier?? If the
answer is yes, then we can apply our framework
to acquisition of hyponymy-relations in other lan-
guages, i.e., German and French, without much
effort for preparing a large amount of training
data, because our strong classifier in English or
Japanese can boost the performance of a weak
classifier in other languages.
To answer the question, we tested the perfor-
mance of classifiers by using all training data
(20,000) for a strong classifier and by changing the
training data size of the other from 1,000 to 15,000
({1,000, 5,000, 10,000, 15,000}) for a weak clas-
sifier.

Tables 4 and 5 show the results, where ?INIT?
represents a system based on the initial classifier
in each language and ?BICO? represents a sys-
tem based on bilingual co-training. The results
were encouraging because the classifiers showed
better performance than their initial ones in every
setting. In other words, a strong classifier always
taught a weak classifier well, and the strong one
also got help from the weak one, regardless of the
size of the training data with which the weaker one
learned. The test showed that bilingual co-training
can work well if we have one strong classifier.
4.3 Effect of Bilingual Instance Dictionaries
We tested our method with different bilingual in-
stance dictionaries to investigate their effect. We
built bilingual instance dictionaries based on dif-
ferent translation dictionaries whose translation
entries came from different domains (i.e., gen-
eral domain, technical domain, and Wikipedia)
and had a different degree of translation ambigu-
ity. In Table 6, D1 and D2 correspond to sys-
tems based on a bilingual instance dictionary de-
rived from two handcrafted translation dictionar-
ies, EDICT (Breen, 2008) (a general-domain dic-
tionary) and ?The Japan Science and Technology
Agency Dictionary,? (a translation dictionary for
technical terms) respectively. D3, which is the
same as BICO in Table 2, is based on a bilingual
438
instance dictionary derived from Wikipedia. EN-
TRY represents the number of translation dictio-
nary entries used for building a bilingual instance
dictionary. E2J (or J2E) represents the average
translation ambiguities of English (or Japanese)
terms in the entries. To show the effect of these
translation ambiguities, we used each dictionary
under two different conditions, ?=5 and ALL. ?=5
represents the condition where only translation en-
tries with less than five translation ambiguities are
used; ALL represents no restriction on translation
ambiguities.

Table 6: Effect of different bilingual instance dic-
tionaries
The results showed that D3 was the best and
that the performances of the others were sim-
ilar to each other. The differences in the F
1
scores between ?=5 and ALL were relatively small
within the same system triggered by translation
ambiguities. The performance gap between D3
and the other systems might explain the fact that
both hyponymy-relation candidates and the trans-
lation dictionary used in D3 were extracted from
the same dataset (i.e., Wikipedia), and thus the
bilingual instance dictionary built with the trans-
lation dictionary in D3 had better coverage of
the Wikipedia entries consisting of hyponymy-
relation candidates than the other bilingual in-
stance dictionaries. Although D1 and D2 showed
lower performance than D3, the experimental re-
sults showed that bilingual co-training was always
effective no matter which dictionary was used
(Note that F
1
of INIT in Table 2 was 72.2 in En-
glish and 76.6 in Japanese.)
5 Related Work
Li and Li (2002) proposed bilingual bootstrapping
for word translation disambiguation. Similar to
bilingual co-training, classifiers for two languages
cooperated in learning with bilingual resources in
bilingual bootstrapping. However, the two clas-
sifiers in bilingual bootstrapping were for a bilin-
gual task but did different tasks from the monolin-
gual viewpoint. A classifier in each language is for
word sense disambiguation, where a class label (or
word sense) is different based on the languages.
On the contrary, classifiers in bilingual co-training
cooperate in doing the same type of tasks.
Bilingual resources have been used for mono-
lingual tasks including verb classification and
noun phrase semantic interpolation (Merlo et al,
2002; Girju, 2006). However, unlike ours, their fo-
cus was limited to bilingual features for one mono-
lingual classifier based on supervised learning.
Recently, there has been increased interest in se-
mantic relation acquisition from corpora. Some
regarded Wikipedia as the corpora and applied
hand-crafted or machine-learned rules to acquire
semantic relations (Herbelot and Copestake, 2006;
Kazama and Torisawa, 2007; Ruiz-casado et al,
2005; Nastase and Strube, 2008; Sumida et al,
2008; Suchanek et al, 2007). Several researchers
who participated in SemEval-07 (Girju et al,
2007) proposed methods for the classification of
semantic relations between simple nominals in
English sentences. However, the previous work
seldom considered the bilingual aspect of seman-
tic relations in the acquisition of monolingual se-
mantic relations.
6 Conclusion
We proposed a bilingual co-training approach and
applied it to hyponymy-relation acquisition from
Wikipedia. Experiments showed that bilingual
co-training is effective for improving the perfor-
mance of classifiers in both languages. We fur-
ther showed that bilingual co-training enables us
to build classifiers for two languages in tandem,
outperforming classifiers trained individually for
each language while requiring no more training
data in total than a single classifier trained in iso-
lation.
We showed that bilingual co-training is also
helpful for boosting the performance of a weak
classifier in one language with the help of a strong
classifier in the other language without lowering
the performance of either classifier. This indicates
that the framework can reduce the cost of prepar-
ing training data in new languages with the help of
our English and Japanese strong classifiers. Our
future work focuses on this issue.
