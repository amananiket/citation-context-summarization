Abstract  
The development of spoken dialogue 
systems is often limited by the performance 
of their speech recognition component. The 
impact of speech recognition errors on 
dialogue systems is often studied at the 
global level of task completion. In this 
paper, we carry an empirical study on the 
consequences of speech recognition errors 
on a fully-implemented dialogue prototype, 
based on a speech acts formalisms. We 
report the impact of speech recognition 
errors on speech act identification and 
discuss how standard control mechanisms 
can participate to robustness by assisting the 
user in repairing the consequences of speech 
recognition errors.  
Introduction 
The development of spoken dialogue systems is 
faced with limitations in speech recognition 
technologies that make recognition errors a 
recurring problem for any dialogue system. 
Several studies have shown little correlation 
between speech recognition scores and user 
satisfaction, or the ability to complete the tasks 
underlying spoken dialogue [Yankelovich et al, 
1995] [Dybkjaer et al, 1997], suggesting that a 
certain level of errors should not prevent spoken 
dialogue systems from being successful.  
However, most of the studies on speech 
recognition errors have concentrated either on 
parsing incomplete utterances or on global 
dialogue robustness, i.e. at task completion level 
[Allen et al, 1996] [Stromback and Jonsson, 
1998] [Brandt-Pook et al, 1996]. 
In this paper, we investigate the impact of 
speech recognition errors on a fully-
implemented prototype for a task-oriented 
dialogue system. This system supports a 
conversational character for Interactive 
Television and is based on a speech acts 
formalism. We report a first empirical study on 
the consequences of speech recognition errors 
on the identification of speech acts, and the 
conditions under which the system can be robust 
to those errors. 
1 System Overview 
The VIP (?Virtual Interactive Presenter?) system 
is a dialogue-based interface to an Electronic 
Programme Guide (EPG). One main advantage 
of human-computer dialogue is that it breaks 
down the information exchange into elementary 
units that correspond to the actual criteria on the 
basis of which TV programmes are selected, i.e. 
individual features such as the cast, the movie 
genre, its rating, etc. It assists the user in 
progressively refining the programme 
description without requiring explicit knowledge 
of the editorial categories used to index the EPG.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1. The System Interface. 
 
Related applications, i.e. dialogue systems 
involving the choice of a film or TV programme 
  
have been also described in [Hagen, 2000] 
[Ludwig et al, 2000]. Our system is a mixed-
initiative conversational interface organised 
around a human-like character with which the 
user communicates through speech recognition 
[Nagao and Takeuchi, 1994] [Beskow and 
McGlashan, 1997]. The interface is based on the 
Microsoft Agent? system with a set of 
animated bitmaps acquired from a real human 
subject (Figure 1). 
An example dialogue illustrating the system 
capabilities is presented below (this example has 
been obtained with keyboard input only). After 
greetings by the system, the user opens the 
dialogue with a first request (U1). Even though 
the system?s goal is to refine the selection, it 
offers potential choices even at early stages of 
the dialogue, e.g. after only the programme 
genre has been specified (S2). As the dialogue 
progresses, it gives a count of programmes 
matching the current criteria and proposes the 
best one. The system acknowledges the most 
specific selections only (S10, S14). Also, the 
system takes initiative whenever necessary 
(S12). It repairs non-productive dialogue, i.e. 
when several utterances have not altered the 
programme description (?is this programme all 
right, then??). Whenever high-level categories 
are rejected by the user, leaaving the system 
without sufficient criteria to filter the EPG 
contents, it re-starts the dialogue (?what would 
you like then??, S12). 
 
U1: Do you have any sports programmes 
S2: I have found 5 programmes for this choice. 
Would you like to watch ?Keegan?s greatest 
games?? 
U3: Can I have some cricket instead? 
S4: I can suggest this programme with cricket: 
?Sportstalk? 
U5: Who?s conducting? 
S6: ?Sportstalk? features Donald 
U7: Anything else? 
S8: I have no other programmes for that 
selection 
U9: Is there anything funny, then? 
S10: I can recommend the following comedy: 
?Starting Out? 
U11: I do not want a sitcom 
S12: What would you like to see, then? 
U13: A funny movie 
S14: I would suggest this programme with 
comedy: ?Analyze This? 
U15: Can I have another one? 
S16 There are 1 other programmes for this 
choice. What about the following programme: 
?Casablanca?? 
U17: I want a western instead 
S18: I would suggest the following western: 
?Unforgiven? 
 
The software architecture is a pipeline 
comprising speech recognition, parsing and 
dialogue. In the next sections, we describe each 
of these components from the perspective of 
speech recognition errors. Finally, we discuss 
the impact of speech recognition errors on 
example dialogues and the mechanisms that 
contribute to dialogue robustness.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2. The ABBOT Interface. 
2 The Speech Recognition Component 
Speech recognition is based on the ABBOT 
system [Robinson et al, 1996]. A specific 
ABBOT version has been developed for the VIP 
prototype, VIP-ABBOT, with a test vocabulary 
of 300+ words (Figure 2). This version is based 
on a trigram model, trained on a small corpus of 
200 user questions and replies, using data from 
six speakers (average recording time is twelve 
minutes). Though the size of the corpus is in 
principle too small to obtain an accurate 
language model, the VIP-ABBOT system 
achieves a satisfactory performance. Global 
speech recognition accuracy has been tested as 
part of the development of the VIP-ABBOT 
version. The recognition accuracy varied across 
tests from 65 to a maximum 80 % (at this stage 
only laboratory conditions with non-noisy 
environments and good quality microphones 
have been considered). The system outputs the 
1-best recognised utterance, which is passed to 
the dialogue system via a datagram socket. 
  
We have assembled an evaluation corpus of 500 
utterances, collected from five speakers 
including one non-native speaker. Including a 
non-native speaker was an empirical way of 
increasing the error rate. Other researchers have 
suggested varying parameters of the speech 
recognition system, such as the beam width 
[Boros et al, 1996], as a method to increase 
word error rate, in order to collect error corpora. 
However, they have not documented whether the 
kind of errors induced in this way actually 
reproduce (in terms of distribution) those 
obtained during the actual use of the system. On 
the other hand, recognition errors obtained with 
native and non-native speakers appear similar in 
our experience, the overall error rate just being 
higher in the latter.  
For the whole corpus, approximately 50% of 
recognised utterances contain at least one speech 
recognition error. 
3 Integrated Parsing of User Utterances 
Strictly speaking, a significant proportion 
(around 50%) of the recognition hypotheses 
produced by VIP-ABBOT are ungrammatical. 
For obvious reasons, and since the early stages 
of system development, we have abandoned the 
idea of producing a complete parse for the 
speech input, not so much because user 
expressions themselves could be ungrammatical 
but rather because recognised utterances were 
most certain to be, considering the error rate.  
One of the key questions for parsing, especially 
in the case of dialogue, where the average 
utterance length is 5-7 words, is whether 
complete parsing is at all necessary [Lewin et 
al., 1999]. We have implemented a simplified 
parser based on a variant of Tree-Adjoining 
Grammars [Cavazza, 1998], This syntactic 
formalism being lexicalised has interesting 
properties in terms of syntax-semantics 
integration. This lexicalised formalism, 
combined with a simple bottom-up parser, is 
well adapted to the partial parsing of 
ungrammatical utterances (Figure 3). 
The main goal of parsing is to produce a 
semantic structure from which speech acts can 
be identified. Semantic features are aggregated 
as the parsing progresses following the syntactic 
operations. As a result, the parser produces a 
feature structure whose semantic elements can 
be mapped to the descriptors indexing the 
programmes in the EPG, such as genre (e.g. 
?movie?, ?news?, ?documentary?), sub-genre 
(e.g., ?comedy?, ?lifestyle?), cast (e.g., ?Jeremy 
Clarkson?), channel (?BBC one?), rating  (e.g., 
?caution?, ?family?), etc.  
Whenever the parser fails to produce a single 
parse, the semantic structures obtained from 
partial parses are merged on a content basis. For 
instance, descriptors such as ?cast? or ?channel? 
are attached to programme descriptions, etc. 
This process confers a good level of robustness 
and tolerance to ungrammaticality. This kind of 
approach, where dialogue strategy is privileged 
over parsing was inspired from early versions of 
the AGS system [Sadek, 1999]. These semantic 
structures are used to generate search filters on 
the EPG database, which correspond to semantic 
descriptions of the user choice. They are also 
used for content-based speech act identification, 
by comparing the semantic contents of 
successive utterances [Cavazza, 2000].

ainly from the task model. As the task is to 
rogressively refine a programme description by 
sing elementary dialogue acts, we have adopted 
 speech acts based approach [Traum and 
inkelmann, 1992]. Each speech act 
orresponds to a specific construction operation 
 it is possible to map communicative operations 
rejection, implicit rejection, specification, etc.) 
o the updating of the programme description, 
hich is a filter through which the EPG database 
s searched. 
e are using a content-based approach to the 
dentification of speech acts [Cavazza, 2000]. 
his method has similarities with the one 
reviously described by Maier [1996]. Another 
ource of inspiration was the work of Walker 
1996], though it was restricted to the 
ecognition of acceptance rather than a complete 
et of speech acts. Figure 4 shows the 
onstruction of search filters from the semantic 
ontents of user utterances. Once a new 
  
utterance is analysed, its semantic contents are 
compared with the active search filter, which has 
been constructed from previous user utterances, 
and this comparison determines speech act 
recognition. For instance, when the last 
utterance contains semantic information for a 
programme sub-genre, the speech act is a 
specification. Explicit rejections are signalled by 
markers of negation, while implicit rejection 
speech acts are recognised when the semantic 
contents of the latest utterance overwrite the 
descriptors of the current filter (this is the case 
when, for instance, when the current filter 
contains the comedy sub-genre and the user asks 
?can I have a western??). 
In this context, speech acts provide a unified and 
consistent way to determine the most 
appropriate answer to the user as well as the way 
in which the search filter should be updated at 
each dialogue turn. In the next section, we 
propose a first empirical categorisation of 
speech recognition errors according to their 
impact on the dialogue process. 
5 From Speech Recognition Errors to Speech 
Acts Recognition Errors 
Traditional error metrics used in speech 
recognition such as ?word accuracy? are not 
reliable to measure the global consequences of 
speech recognition errors on the dialogue 
process. This is why it has been proposed that a 
?concept accuracy? be used in place of a word 
accuracy. These two metrics appear however to 
be linearly correlated [Boros et al, 1996].  
Word errors result in semantic errors, which in 
turn result in speech act recognition errors. It is 
the latter phenomenon that we are investigating, 
though through a largely empirical approach. 
We have developed the following experimental 
approach to assess the consequences of speech 
recognition errors. Within a set of possible ?test? 
dialogues, we have been running each user reply 
on several users to collect an error corpus. Then 
the impact of errors at critical points of dialogue 
can be tested on the system using textual input, 
entering the utterances comprising speech 
recognition errors. This also makes possible to 
explore the consequences of a set of errors at 
various stages of the dialogue process (see 
below).  
In doing so, we are essentially exploring system 
behaviour in a glass box approach: this does not 
constitute an evaluation method for dialogue 
performance [Walker et al, 1997]. The only 
global metric that can be used in our case is 
dialogue length, as a measure of the extra 
dialogue turns required to repair the 
consequences of a speech recognition error. 
5.1 ?Fatal? Speech Recognition Errors 
Obviously, the worst errors are those which 
terminate the dialogue by selecting a programme 
that the user intended to reject. This happens 
when the semantic structure produced from the 
mis-recognised utterance can be interpreted as 
an acceptance speech act. In the following short 
dialogues, the user implicitly rejects the 
selection offered by the system. He does so by 
specifying either the parental rating (U21) or the 
sub-genre (U25). However, due to speech 
recognition errors, specific semantic information 
disappears in both cases, while the insertion of 
the word ?good? results in the system producing 
a semantic structure that is recognised as an 
acceptance speech act.  
 
U19: Can I have a movie? 
S20: I have found 22 programmes for that 
selection. I would recommend: ?Midnight Fear? 
U21: I want a movie my good can watch 
(REF: I want a movie my kids can watch) 
S22: Here is ?Midnight Fear?, then. Goodbye! 
 
U23: Do you have any movies? 
S24: I found 22 programmes for your request. I 
would suggest: ?Twelve Monkeys? 
U25: Good if I mean anything for long (REF: 
could you find me anything funny)  
S26: Here is ?Twelve Monkeys?, then. 
Goodbye! 
 
5.2 User Correction of Mis-recognition 
Some speech recognition errors result in an 
incorrect speech act being recognised, but can be 
easily corrected by the user at the expense of a 
few additional dialogue turns, as shown by the 
following example (especially U31). 
 
U27: I would like to watch a movie 
S28: I found 22 programmes for this choice. I 
can recommend: ?The Day of the Jackal?   
U29: Can I have worse him? (REF: can I have 
a western?) 
S30: What about the following programme: 
?Midnight Fear??  
  
U31: No, I want a western 
S32: I can recommend this programme which is 
a western: ?Unforgiven?  
 
The next dialogue illustrates an important aspect 
of speech recognition errors. Their impact 
actually varies according to the dialogue stage at 
which they take place. The same kind of error 
that resulted in premature acceptance has less 
dramatic consequences when it occurs in the 
opening request. It results in a partial 
understanding, where the EPG is searched for 
the right genre (?movie?) but without the right 
parental rating. This additional criterion can thus 
be subsequently added by the user, resulting in a 
successful search at the price of a longer 
dialogue. 
 
U33: Is there a movie my good can watch? 
(REF: is there a movie my kids can watch?) 
S34: I have 22 programmes for your request. 
Would you like to watch: ?Midnight Fear?  
U35: What is its rating? 
S36: Its rating is caution 
U37: No, I want a movie my kids can watch 
S38: I would recommend this programme 
corresponding to that ?family? rating: ?Rio 
Bravo? 
 
5.3 System Detection of Mis-recognition 
Some dialogue control mechanisms originally 
developed to monitor dialogue progression can 
also assist in recovering from speech recognition 
errors. The system can detect dead ends in 
dialogue, for instance when not enough 
information is available for programme 
selection. The speech recognition error in U39 
results in a semantic structure rejecting sports 
programmes as ?boring?. In the absence of any 
category selected, the system returns to the user 
(S40), who can then correct the selection: an 
explicit request for the sports category over-
writes its previous rejection. 
 
U39:  What kind of sports boring you have? 
(REF: what kind of sports programmes do you 
have) 
S40: What would you like to see, then?  
U41: A sports programme 
S42: I could find 5 programmes for this choice. I 
can recommend: ?Row Z?  
 
Also, the system reacts to non-productive 
dialogue, i.e. utterances that simply repeat 
categories already represented in the programme 
descriptors. This has an interesting side effect, in 
that it can detect deletion of negation markers, as 
in the example below.  
 
S43: What about the following programme: 
?Countryfile? 
U44: Again want a documentary (REF: I don?t 
want a documentary) 
S45: Is this programme all right, then? 
 
5.4 ?Semantic? Robustness 
The basis for robustness can be seen as a 
combination of shallow processing and natural 
redundancy of information in some of the user 
replies. For instance, in U52, even though the 
entry ?role? as been deleted from the recognised 
utterance, there are sufficient semantic cues to 
activate a ?cast? descriptor. 
 
U46: I would like to watch a movie 
S47: I found 22 programmes for this choice. I 
would recommend: ?Midnight Fear?   
U48: Good if I mean anything funny (REF: 
could you find me anything funny) 
S49: I can recommend this programme which is 
a comedy: ?Casablanca?  
 
U50: what kind of movies do you have 
S51: I have found 22 programmes for this 
choice. I would suggest: ?Twelve Monkeys?   
U52: Who is playing the title all? (REF: who is 
playing the title role?) 
S53: ?Twelve Monkeys? features Bruce Willis   
 
U54: Do you have any documentaries 
S55: I have 2 programmes for your request. My 
first selection is: ?Ground Force? 
U56: An old gardening is not a little A   (REF: 
no, gardening is not OK) 
S57: I can recommend this programme, which is 
not a gardening: ?Fangs? 
 
Another element of robustness lies in the surface 
form of some linguistic expressions for 
acknowledgement, acceptance and rejection, 
which often contains redundant information: 
?yes, this is fine?, ?no, I don?t like that one?, 
?no, gardening is not OK?, etc. 
 
 
  
User:            IS THERE ANYTHING FUNNY I CAN WATCH 
Recognised: THE IS THERE ANYTHING FUNNY I CAN WATCH   
Semantics: (((QUESTION) (EXIST) (PROGRAMME ((CHOICE+))) (DET))
((GOOD) (SUB_GENRE COMEDY)) ((AUDIENCE USER)) ((QUESTION))
((VIEW)))  
Filter: ((SUB_GENRE COMEDY)) 
Speech Act: (INITIAL (SUB_GENRE COMEDY) SEARCH)  
 
System: I found 4 programmes corresponding to that selection. What about: ?Starting Out??   
 
User:              NO I DON?T WANT A SITCOM 
Recognised:   AN OLD I DON'T WANT A SITCOM   
Semantics: ((CHOICE+) (NEGATIVE) (AUDIENCE ((AUDIENCE USER)))
(PROGRAMME
((SUB_GENRE COMEDY) (GENRE ENTERTAINMENT) (INDET))))  
Filter: ((GENRE ENTERTAINMENT) (SUB_GENRE COMEDY) (NEGATIVE)) 
Speech Act: (REJECT GENRE NIL NO_SEARCH)  
 
System: What would you like to see, then?  
 
User:            A COMEDY MOVIE 
Recognised: A COMEDY MOVIE   
Semantics: (((SUB_GENRE COMEDY) (INDET)) ((GENRE MOVIES)))  
Filter: ((GENRE MOVIES) (SUB_GENRE COMEDY))  
Speech Act: (SPECIFY SUB_GENRE COMEDY SEARCH)  
 
System: My first selection is this programme with comedy: ?Casablanca?  
 
User:            YES THIS IS FINE 
Recognised: YES THE IS FIND THAT   
Semantics: (((GOOD) (POSITIVE)) ((DET)) ((ATTRIBUTE)))  
Speech Act: (SIMPLE-ACCEPT) 
 
System: Here is ?Casablanca?, then. Goodbye!  
 
Figure 4. A Sample Dialogue with Internal Representations 
 
 
5.5  ?Accidental? Robustness 
Another form of robustness appears to be rather 
accidental. It happens when a incorrect speech 
act is recognised, but its effects in terms of 
system response are a subset of those of the 
correct speech act. In the following example, the 
user intends to reject the proposal (?Salvador?) 
by specifying a parental rating. This is actually 
interpreted as a simple rejection of the 
programme instance (Other speech act), 
preserving the current ?movie? category 
selected. The new proposal happens to match the 
criteria by chance (i.e., the parental rating is not 
grounded in the system reply, see e.g. S38).  
 
U58: What movies do you have? 
S59: I found 22 programmes for this choice. I 
can suggest: ?Salvador? 
U60: Other one like is this to there it is (REF: 
I don?t want my kids to see this) 
S61: I have 21 other programmes for that 
selection. What about the following programme: 
?Casablanca? 
Conclusion 
We have explored the consequences of speech 
recognition errors in terms of content-based 
speech acts recognition. There appears to be a 
number of factors that support the robustness of 
the system to speech recognition errors, among 
which the fact that dialogue control mechanisms 
triggered by speech act recognition can 
contribute to repairing the consequences of 
speech recognition errors. Some improvement is 
possible in the treatment of errors involving 
mismatches between categories and 
  
connotations (such as ?funny motoring?), by 
including semantic consistency checks. On the 
other hand, errors involving wrongful 
acceptance and dialogue termination appear 
difficult to deal with. 
Finally, Fischer and Batliner [2000] have 
investigated which system replies are most 
likely to upset the user. These replies cannot 
always be always avoided, though, precisely 
because they are used to repair incorrect 
understanding or inconsistent one. It is thus 
important to investigate whether speech 
recognition errors increase the occurrence of 
these upsetting replies (apart from the 
unavoidable and necessary repairs). Obviously, 
in our context the most upsetting cases are the 
selection of a programme explicitly rejected by 
the user. However, It would also be necessary to 
explore whether the repair mechanisms 
described above are well accepted by the users.
