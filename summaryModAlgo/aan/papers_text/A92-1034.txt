Abstract 
Morph~ is a Common Lisp compiler for reversible 
inflectional morphology rules developed at the Cen- 
ter for Machine Translation at Carnegie Mellon Uni- 
versity. This paper describes the Morph~ process- 
ing model, its implementation, and how it handles 
some common morphological processes. 
1 Introduction 
The input to the Morph~ rule compiler is a rule file containing 
inflection rules, the specification of a discrimination network 
of morphological forms, and definitions of certain classes of 
strings and string mappings. This rule file can be compiled 
into either a word generation program or a word parsing pro- 
gram. The word generation program produces an inflected 
surface form from a feature structure, 1 while the word pars- 
ing program takes an inflected form and produces a set of 
feature structures for valid parses. 2 
2 The Processing Model 
In Morph~ the process of inflection is seen as consisting of 
two basic steps: 
1. By making a series of feature- and orthographically- 
based decisions, choose an inflection procedure. 
2. Apply that procedure to the uninflected root. 
To implement the first step, Morph~ uses a feature-based 
discrimination etwork with orthographically-based inflec- 
tion rules at the leaves. Each node in the discrimination 
network specifies aset of features common to all of its descen- 
dants. For example, at the top of a subtree for nouns, a node 
might contain the features { (cat: noun)  } which wouldbe 
inherited by the nodes for single-noun and plural-noun, and 
SO on. 
That Morph~ explicitly divides feature-based decisions 
from orthographic decisions has two important consequences: 
1These feature slructures are structurally the same as those used 
by the Generalized LR Parser/Compiler \[Tomita et al, 1988\] and 
the Generation Kit \[Tomita and Nyberg, 1988\], and can contain 
non-syntactic features. 
2A detailed escription of the Morph~ program and rule file for- 
malism and some example rule files axe given in \[Leavitt, 1992\]. 
? The type of feature that may be checked in the discrimi- 
nation network is not restricted. For instance, phonolog- 
ical and/or morphological features (e.g. paradigm) can 
be checked alongside syntactic features (e.g. category). 
? A single morpheme can be split across everal leaf nodes 
if feature tests below the morpheme l vel are necessary. 
2.1 The Rule Formalism 
As shown in Figure 1, a rule consists of a set of clauses, each 
of which contains orthographic pattern on the left-hand side 
and a set of inflection operations on the right-hand side. 
? Orthographic patterns. The orthographically-based d - 
cisions are made by matching against regular expression- 
based patterns. Standard regular expression operations 
(i.e. Kleene closure, wildcards, etc.) are included. In 
addition, non-standard operations for matching against 
a pre-defined class of strings 3, and binding and retrieval 
of portions of the word 4 are included. 
? Inflection Operations. The application of the inflection 
procedure is implemented asthe sequential execution of 
the inflection operations in the right-hand side. The in- 
flection operations include affixation, deletion, and the 
combined operation of "replacement" in prefix, suffix, 
and infix positions. Also included is an operation for per- 
forming regular string-to-string mapping within a word.5 
3 Processing 
During generation, processing begins with a feature structure 
entering the tree at the root node, and trickling down to the 
appropriate l af node. Once at the leaf node, the word root is 
compared against each clause's orthographic pattern in turn. 
When a match is found, the inflection procedure for that clause 
is applied to the word root and the result is returned. 
During parsing, processing begins with an inflected form 
entering the tree at each leaf node where the inflection rules 
are applied "in reverse" and the non-passing results discarded. 
Applying a rule "in reverse" means that the word is matched 
3This class matching isequivalent"alphabet subsets" inKIMMO 
\[Karttunen etal., 1983\], "restricted variables" in NABU \[Slocum, 
1988\], and "sla'ing vats" in DIMORPH \[Gibson, 1991\]. 
4These mechanisms are similar to the binding and retrieval mech- 
anisms used in Unix utilities such as "sed". 
5String-to-string mapping is roughly equivalent to the "pairing- 
up \[of\] variables" inNABU.

against he inflected forms and the operations perform de- 
inflection, rather than vice versa. After all clauses in all 
leaves have been tried, and presumably most results have 
been discarded, each remaining parse follows the network 
upwards, collecting the features of each node it traverses until 
a set of full feature structures arrives at the root node. When 
this process is finished, a lexicon check is made to ensure that 
only valid words (of the proper category, paradigm, etc.) are 
kept. 
4 Handling Common Morphological 
Processes 
This section explains how common morphological processes 
are handled by Morph~. 
? Affixation. Prefixation, suffixation, and infixation are 
handled irectly by the +p, +s, and +5. inflection oper- 
ators. To determine the insertion point, infixes must be 
placed either before or after some portion of the word 
that was bound during pattern matching. 
? Deletion. Word initial, word final, and word internal 
deletion are handled directly by the -p ,  - s ,  and -5_ 
inflection operators. As with infixation, some bound 
part of the word must act as an "anchor" for the deletion. 
? Gemination and Reduplication. Since expressions may 
be bound during pattern matching, bound expressions 
can be affixed to the word to create the effects of gem- 
ination or reduplication. For example, when forming 
the present participle, certain English verbs repeat he 
final consonant before adding the suffix "ing" (e.g. "cut" 
--~ "cutting"). This simple twinning is encoded by the 
third clause in the above sample rule. Reduplication, as 
found in Warlpiri \[Sproat and Brunson, 1988\], or Latin 
\[Matthews, 1974\], can be handled in a similar manner 
(i.e. by binding the appropriate portion of the root and 
retrieving it during affixation). 
? Paradigmatic Alternation. Alternations that consists of 
a single mapping of one string to another, such as the 
"-fe/-ve" alternation for the plural of English nouns like 
"wife" or"knife" can be handled by a single replacement 
operation. Alternations that consist of a number of re- 
lated alternation, such as the {"-us/-i" -um/-a" -a/-ae"} 
alternation for the plural of English nouns like "octopus", 
"spectrum", and "vertebra" could be handled as separate 
cases, but it is convenient to be able to refer to the en- 
tire class of alternations. The map operator invokes a 
string-to-string mapping on a bound portion of a word. 6 
Alternations such as vowel rounding in the comparative 
forms of German adjectives, and consonant and vowel 
alternation i Rumanian, can be handled by this method. 
? Suppletion. Morph~ currently handles uppletion by re- 
quiring suppletive forms (e.g. "went" for "go") to be 
included in the lexicon. In this, it is not unlike many 
other system, such as KIMMO and DIMORPH. 
5 Current Uses and Future Research 
Morph~ is presently being used for French and German gen- 
eration morphology in the Kant project, a knowledge-based 
machine translation system being developed at Carnegie Mel- 
lon University \[Mitamura etal., 1991\]. In addition, arule file 
has been developed for English and one is currently being de- 
signed for Spanish. Future research will be directed towards 
morphological phenomena that cannot currently be handled 
in an elegant fashion. Certain types of suppletion, such as 
irregular stems with regular endings in Latin, should be han- 
dled more generally and with less reliance on the lexicon as a 
storehouse of irregularities. In addition, the design of mech- 
anisms appropriate othe handling of prosodic inflection will 
also be investigated.

6It should be noted that binding the appropriate portion of the 
word is a non.vial task and may require a place marker in the root 
to help the pattern locate it. This is, however, an artifact of language, 
not  the inflection model.
