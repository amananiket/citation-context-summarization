I~DIS Praha, Czechos lovak ia  
In  th i s  paper I want to  sketch  an ana lys i s  of  the con-  
oept of  unders tand ing  ( in  the semant ic  sense of  word).  No com- 
parat ion  w i th  o ther  at tempts  at  such an ana lys i s  wal l  be made. 
S ince the most adequate log ica l  too l  fo r  ana lyz ing  natura l  
language i s ,  to  the author ' s  op in ion ,  T ioh~'s  " t ransparent

Temporal D iscourse ,  L ingu is t i cs  and Ph i losophy 3 (1980),  343- 
369),  I sha l l  f i r s t  adduce a br ie f  expos i t ion  of  some re levant  
concepts  of  TIL.

Objects  which are supposed to be denoted by the express -  
ions  of  a (natura l )  language are  type- theoret i ca l  ob jec ts  
over  an "ep is temtc  bas i s " ,  where e lementary  types are the 
un iverse  of d i scourse  (L ) ,  the set  of  t ru thvva lues  (o ) ,  the 
set  of  t ime moments or  rea l  numbers (~) ,  and the log ica l  
space (~ ; members of  ~ are "poss ib le  wor lds" ) i  compound 
types  are sets  of  (par t ia l  and to ta l )  funct ions .  The ob Jedts  
are  the members of  the par t i cu la r  types .  The ob jec ts  denoted 
(named) by "normal"  express ions  of  a language are in tens ions ,  
i .e . ,  funct ions  whose domain i s  ~ .  Thus de f in i te  descr ip t ions

I n  TIL there  i s  in t roduced  a concept of  key importance= 
the concept o f  const ruc t ion .  In tu i t i ve ly ,  a const ruc t ion  i s  
a way in  which an ob jec t  can be g iven .  Atomic const ruc t ions  
are ob jec ts  themselves  (an ob jec t  _A const ruc ts  A_) and variabl- 
es of  the g iven  type (a var iab le  v -const ruc ts  an ob jec t  de-  
pendent ly  on the  va luat ion  v ) .  Non-atomic const ruc t ions  are 
app l i ca t ions  of  funct ions  to the i r  arguments,  and ~-abst rac t -  
i ons .  Const ruc t ions  are  de f ined  induct ive ly ,  so that  an in -

Dis t ingu ish ing  between const ruc t ions  and ob jec ts  i s  one 
of  main cont r ibut ions  of  TIL. Every ob jec t  i s  a const ruc t ion  
(o f  atomic const ruc t ions! )  but the var iab les  and non-atomic  
const ruc t ions  are not ob jec ts .  
The in ter re la t ions  between lans~age express ions ,  ob jec ts  
and const ruc t ions  are  s t ipu la ted  as fo l lows :  
Let  E be a language express ion :  E expresses  a const ruc t -  
i on ,  say,  CE, and names (denotes)  the  ob jec t ,  say,  OE, which 
i s  const ruc ted  by C E- 
There are ,  however, some express ions  whose ro le  d i f fe rs  
from the  ro le  of  "normal" ,  semant ica l l y  ana lyzab le  express ions .  
This concerns 
i) expressions whose role is solely a syntactic one, 
i i )  i n te r jec t ions ,  
ill) "egocentric expressions" such as "I", "you", "her.n, 
"thiS", etc .  
The category  i i )  i s  un in teres t ing  in  our context .  As 
fo r  i ) ,  t rans form~ E in to  C E i s  genera l ly  imposs ib le  wi thout  
the express ions  from th i s  ca tegory .  With i l i ) ,  a pragmat ic  
e l~nent  appears:  the t rans format ion  in to  C E i s  poss ib le  on ly  
i f  we are  acqua in ted  wi th  the s i tuat ion  in  which E has been 
ut te red .  
A spec ia l  ca tegory  of  express ions  i s ,  from the semant ic  
v iewpo in t ,  the category  of  " formal  express ions" ,  such as the 
mathemat ica l  ones,  e .g . ,  "two t imes  three"  or  " four  minus two 
- 200 - 
equa ls  two" .  These express ions  a re  supposed  to  denote  d i rec t -  
l y  const ruct ions .  
2 ,  U_nder_st.and_i_n~, I t  may be s ta ted  that  there  i s  a ge -  
nera l  agreement among llngulsts, as well as among logicians, 
that understanding (in the semantic sense) is a relation 
between an individual and an expression. Any explication must, 
however ,  spec i fy  th i s  re la t ion ,  With respect  to  what has  been  
sa id  above ,  there  are  two pr inc ipa l  poss ib i l i t i es  o f  such  a 
specification- 
a) (the individual) A understands E iff A asociates E 
with the object (0 E) denoted by E! 
b) A understands E iff A associates E with the construct- 
tion (~)  expressed (or - in case of a mathematical 
expression - denoted) by E.  
Thus let A hear or read a sentence S. In the case a) 
we would say that A understands S iff he knows that S names 
a proposition P. In the case b) we should say that A under- 
stands S iff he knows the construction C S that constructs P 
(or any structure preserving the meanings of "atomic express- 
ions" and isomorph with CS). 
It is clear that understanding in the sense of b) 
implies understanding in the sense of a) wherever both these 
senses are thinksble.We can show, however, that the implicat- 
ion does not hold vice versa. Indeed, take the English sen- 
fence  
(S)  John  owns a cut lass  o r  he does  not  own a cut lass .  
Even those  who do  not  know what a cut lass  i s  w i l l  know that  
(S) denotes the proposition "verum", i.e., the proposition 
which is true in every possible world at every time moment. 
Thus not knowing the construction C S (because of not knowing 
an atom being part of it) the above individuals know the 
object (i.eo, the proposition) denoted by (S). One argument 
against explloatlnE understanding in the sense a) is that we 
would probably hesitate to say that who does not know the 
meaning of "cutlass" does all the same understand (S).

Another argument aga ins t  a) i s  s t r i c t ly  bound ~o our 
concept ion  and can be formulated ms fo l lows :  in  the case of  
mathematical expressions a) is not applicable, since such 
expressions generally name constructions rather than objects. 
The last argument in favour of b) again refers to our 
intuition: we feel that one can "more or less" understand an 
expression. This "more or less" is excluded if we connect 
understanding with the objects named by expressions (or~ at 
most, we must confine ourselves to the cases of "more or less" 
clear meanings of particular atomic expressions). When connect- 
ing understanding with constructions we can explicate tbls 
"more or less" rather intuitively. We shall sketch this ex- 
plication (technical details are omitted again): Let the 
given expression E contain n "atomic", i.e., unanalyzable 
meaningful (sub/expressions) including, as the case may be, 
the expressions from the category iii) ) el,...,e n. A necess- 
ary condition for A's understanding E (in the sense b) ) is 
that A associated the appropriate atomic constructions, i.eo, 
objects with el,...,e n. (The second necessary condition 
consists in A's correct transformation of E into a construct- 
ion schema according to the grammar of the given language). 
Now, the degree of A's understanding E can be, among others, 
measured by 1 - k /n ,  where k i s  the number of  those subexpress -  
ions  among e l , . . . , en ,  which are assoc ia ted  >y A w i th  no ob jec t  
at  a l l !  ana log ica l ly ,  the degree of  A 's  misunders tand ing  E 
can be measured by k ' /n ,  where k ? i s  the  number of  those  
subexpress ions  among e l , . . . , en ,  which are assoc ia ted  by A 
w i th  an inappropr ia te  ob jec t .  (C lear ly ,  k~" k '<  n . )  
Thus i t  seems more appropr ia te  to accept  the pos i t ion  
b) and to c la im that  unders tand ing  i s  a re la t ion  between an 
ind iv id~.a l  and an express ion  which ho lds  i f f  the ind iv idua l  
cor rec t ly  assoc ia tes  two s t ruc tured  ent i t ies :  the  grammatica l  
(o r :  tec togrammat ica l )  s t ruc ture  of  the express ion  and the  
( log ica l )  s t ruc ture  of  the cor respond ing  const ruc t ions
