We argue the case for abstract document structure as a separate descriptive level in the anal-
ysis and generation of written texts. The purpose of this representation is to mediate between the
message of a text (i.e., its discourse structure) and its physical presentation (i.e., its organization
into graphical constituents like sections, paragraphs, sentences, bulleted lists, figures, and foot-
notes). Abstract document structure can be seen as an extension of Nunberg?s ?text-grammar?;
it is also closely related to ?logical? markup in languages like HTML and LaTEX. We show that
by using this intermediate representation, several subtasks in language generation and language
understanding can be defined more cleanly.
1. Introduction
When language is written, it appears as a collection of words set out on one or more
(actual or virtual) pages. In fact, much of what we tend to call ?text? has a strong
graphical component (Schriver 1997; Scott and Power 2001). Not only are the words
often accompanied by conventional graphics such as pictures or diagrams, but they
themselves form graphical elements such as titles, headings, chapters, sections, cap-
tions, paragraphs, and bulleted lists.
The overlay of graphics on text is in many ways equivalent to the overlay of
prosody on speech. Just as all speech has prosody (even if it is a monotone), so too do
all texts have layout (even if it is simple wrapped format, in a single face and font, and
makes rudimentary use of white space). And just as prosody undoubtedly contributes
to the meaning of utterances, so too does a text?s graphical presentation contribute to its
meaning. However, although there is a long tradition and rich linguistic framework for
describing and representing speech prosody (e.g., Halliday 1967; Chomsky and Halle
1968; Crystal 1969; Bolinger 1972; Pierrehumbert 1980; ?t Hart, Collier, and Cohen 1990;
Ladd 1996), the same is not true for text layout. Perhaps not surprisingly, therefore, few
natural language understanding (NLU) systems use graphical presentational features
to aid interpretation, and few natural language generation (NLG) systems attempt to
render the output texts in a principled way.
Of course, since all texts have a graphical dimension, all NLG systems will, by
definition, produce laid-out texts. In all but a few recent cases (the ICONOCLAST sys-
tem (Power 2000; Bouayad-Agha, Power, and Scott 2000; Bouayad-Agha, Scott, and
Power 2001; Bouayad-Agha 2001) and the DArtbio system (Bateman et al 2001)), this
is achieved by mapping directly from the underlying discourse structure (Arens and

Hovy 1990; DiMarco et al 1995; Paris et al 1995; Power and Cavallotto 1996; Lavoie
and Rambow 1997; Mittal et al 1998). In other cases, the text is mapped onto pre-
determined genre-specific layout patterns?for example, for verbalizing mathematical
proofs (Huang and Fiedler 1997) or producing letters for customers (Coch 1996). If we
take, as most do, the level of discourse structure as representative of the underlying
message of a text, such systems are subject to a fundamental limitation. Simply put, for
each message there will be but one possible form of presentation.
As an illustration let us briefly consider the well-known consensus architecture
for NLG systems proposed by Reiter (1994). This architecture, based on a survey
of NLG systems from the 1980s and early 1990s, takes the form of a ?pipeline? in
which five modules are applied in sequence: content determination, sentence planning,
surface generation, morphology, and formatting. Sentence planning maps ?conceptual
structures into linguistic ones . . . grouping information into clauses and sentences?
(Reiter 1994, page 164), but formatting (specified, for example, by LaTEX markup) occurs
only in the final formatting stage. In consequence, the organization of material into
paragraphs, bulleted lists, etc., is considered only after the wording has been fixed.
Graphical presentation, however, clearly interacts with wording. For example, the
section of a message that, at the level of discourse, is composed of a list relation,
will be expressed differently depending on whether, at the presentational level, it is
mapped onto a vertical or horizontal list. Consider a simple example like the following,
taken from a patient information leaflet (PIL):
(1) Are you taking any of the following:
? Anticoagulants?
? Lithium?
? Methotrexate?
? Any other medicines which your doctor does not know about?
(Voltarol leaflet, Geigy; from APBI 1997)
If the very same content were presented instead as a horizontal list, we would expect
to get something like:
(2) Are you taking anticoagulants, lithium, methotrexate, or any other medicines which
your doctor does not know about?
Now all the information is packed into one sentence, with some missing and addi-
tional words, wildly different punctuation, and less generous use of upper-case letters.1
Mapping directly from discourse structure to graphical presentation during generation
therefore limits not only the choice of possible layout, but also the choice of possible
wording.
There have been some recent attempts to develop NLG systems that generate doc-
uments rather than just texts. Instead of producing text plans, they produce document
plans. Typically these are the text plans of old (i.e., structures of ordered content ele-
ments represented in terms of rhetorical structure theory (Mann and Thompson 1986,
1987)), but extended to include pictures or diagrams as content elements, and with
additional annotations for metalevel elements such as paragraph or sentence bound-
aries. Figure 1 shows the type of document plan proposed by Reiter and Dale (2000).
1 Indeed, it appears to be the case that the more graphical the presentation is, the greater the difference
in wording is likely to be over the unmarked case of plain text (Bouayad-Agha, Scott, and Power 2000).

Although this approach allows for a more reasoned presentational format, by conflat-
ing discourse and presentational features into one structure, the possible generated
expressions of any given message are once again strongly limited relative to the set of
all possible valid expressions.
We wish to argue the case for a separate descriptive level in the analysis and gen-
eration of written texts, which we will call document structure. Informally, document
structure describes the organization of a document into graphical constituents like
sections, paragraphs, sentences, bulleted lists, and figures; it also covers some features
within sentences, including quotation and emphasis. Although document structure
applies equally to NLU and NLG, we will focus our attention here on its role in the
generation of appropriate presentations (both wording and layout) of texts. As we will
try to show, texts (unless they are fairly simple) cannot be produced to a satisfactory
standard unless document structure is specified earlier in the process than suggested
in previous works (e.g., Reiter 1994; Reiter and Dale 2000), so that interactions with
meaning and wording are taken into account.
The plan of the article is as follows. In section 2 we explain more fully what we
mean by document structure, acknowledging its origins in Nunberg?s (1990) work and
text markup languages such as LaTEX and HTML. Section 3 discusses the relationship
of document structure to rhetorical organization and syntax. Section 4 presents the
formal theory of document structure, and Section 5 shows how it is applied in the
ICONOCLAST system. Finally, Section 6 summarizes the argument and discusses some
other approaches to the representation and generation of layout.

2. Defining Document Structure
2.1 Nunberg?s Text Grammar
Our point of departure has been the theory of text structure proposed by Nunberg
(1990) in The Linguistics of Punctuation. This book introduces two crucial clarifications.
First, it distinguishes text structure,2 which is realized by punctuation and layout, from
syntactic structure. Second, it distinguishes abstract features of text structure from the
concrete (or graphical) features through which they are expressed.
The distinction between text structure and syntax can best be explained by consid-
ering two interpretations of the word sentence. In linguistics, sentence is used mainly as
a syntactic category, defined by phrase structure rules such as S ? NP+VP. However,
a sentence can also be viewed orthographically as a portion of text starting with a
capital letter and ending in a period; to distinguish this from the syntactic category,
Nunberg calls it a text-sentence. Sometimes the two categories of sentence coincide,
but often they do not. Thus in the following passage:
(3) He entered the office. Disaster. The safe was open and the money had gone.
the first text-sentence is also a syntactic sentence, but the second is merely a noun,
and the third comprises two syntactic sentences (or three, if we count the whole as
well as its parts). Nunberg argues that if we have two kinds of category, then we need
two kinds of grammar: he calls them the lexical grammar (we prefer syntactic gram-
mar) and the text-grammar. In addition to text-sentence, the text-categories include
text-clause, paragraph, and section, and the text-grammar allows us to formulate con-
stituent structure rules such as
St ? Ct+
meaning that a text-sentence comprises one or more text-clauses.
In introducing the concepts text-sentence, text-clause, etc., it is convenient to explain
them in terms of their realization in punctuation and layout: thus a text-sentence
starts with a capital letter and ends in a period; a text-clause ends in a semicolon;
a paragraph begins on a new line with a tab. However, this is not strictly correct.
In Nunberg?s theory, these concepts represent abstract structural properties of the text
that may be realized differently according to context or convention. In the case of
paragraph this distinction is obvious, since we are all familiar with several devices for
expressing paragraph boundaries: instead of a new line with a tab, for example, an
editor might prefer two new lines (or some other vertical space) with no tab. However,
the abstract/concrete distinction also applies to the other text-categories. For example,
the passage:
(4) The safe was open; the money had gone.
contains two text-clauses, but the second has no semicolon because its ending coincides
with the closure of a larger unit, a text-sentence, which is marked by a period. Similarly,
the stop at the end of a text-sentence is often dropped when the sentence is an item
2 This should not be confused with the use of this term within the NLG literature to refer to the
discourse structure of a text.
215

in a vertical list, for instance, in a sequence of instructions:
(5) To save the file:
1. Open the Save dialogue-box
2. Enter the filename
3. Click on the Save button
Thus text structure is realized by punctuation (and layout), but the two are not equiv-
alent.
2.2 Markup Languages
Nunberg?s notion of text structure, or our wider notion of document structure, has an
obvious connection to the markup languages (e.g., LaTEX, SGML) now in common use
as a method for specifying layout in an ASCII source file. The common philosophy
of these languages is that markup should abstract from the visual appearance of the
document, using concepts like paragraph that might be realized graphically in different
ways, depending on a separate style definition.
This approach has several advantages, of which the most obvious is flexibility.
An exact specification of the desired spatial layout can yield only one printed form
of the document; by employing abstract categories, definitions using LaTEX or SGML
can produce a range of printed forms, depending on which style file is used. Less
obviously, the markup language can be tailored to the genre of the document, so that,
for example, a poem may have a constituent marked stanza, whereas a letter may have
one marked address.
In practice, this separation of abstract structure from visual realization is not car-
ried through consistently; for reasons of convenience, authors sometimes prefer to
have direct control over appearance. Thus LaTEX, for example, allows both the abstract
tag em, meaning emphasis, and the visual tag it, meaning italic face. Vertical separation
is usually achieved through abstract tags like section and itemize but may also be
imposed directly using vspace. All these devices have counterparts in HTML: thus
a typical reference guide to HTML (Ford and Dixon 1996) explicitly distinguishes
?logical? tags such as <EM> from ?visual? tags such as <I>.
More subtly, the markup languages in common use do not attempt to cover struc-
tural units that are realized through punctuation rather than layout. Paragraphs may
be marked (albeit implicitly in LaTEX), but lower units such as text-sentence and text-
clause are not. No doubt there are good practical reasons for this approach, but some
opportunities for stylistic variation are thereby lost. Consider, for example, the simple
case of reported speech in example (6a). If this were marked up as a sentence contain-
ing a quotation, it could be punctuated differently, with the period outside the closing
quotation mark (6b), perhaps, or using double quote (6c), or even using a dash with
no quotation marks at all (6d) (as in James Joyce?s Ulysses):
(6)
(a) She said ?Come up and see me sometime.?
(b) She said ?Come up and see me sometime?.
(c) She said ?Come up and see me sometime.?
(d) She said?Come up and see me sometime.
Thus although markup languages provide some guidance toward a formal treat-
ment of document structure, they often deviate, for practical reasons, from the philo-
sophical ideal of separating abstract structure from visual presentation. On the one
216
Computational Linguistics Volume 29, Number 2
hand, some tags (e.g., italic face) are clearly visual and should not be included in
abstract document structure at all. On the other hand, some abstract categories (e.g.,
text-sentence, quoted speech) are omitted from the tag set and thus cannot be realized
in a range of different graphical styles.
Despite these compromises, markup languages are based on a key insight that is
highly relevant to natural language analysis and generation: layout can be matched to
wording through the mediation of abstract document structure. Consider the following three
versions of a passage adapted from a patient information leaflet:
(7)
(a) Elixir is a white cream.
It is used in the treatment of cold sores.
It contains aliprosan. This is effective against a range of viral skin disorders.
It should be used only on your lips and face.
(b) Elixir is a white cream.
It is used in the treatment of cold sores.
It contains aliprosan. This is effective against a range of viral skin disorders.
It should be used only on your lips and face.
(c) Elixir is a white cream. It is used in the treatment of cold sores. It contains aliprosan.
This is effective against a range of viral skin disorders. N.B. Elixir should be used only
on your lips and face.
Suppose that example (7a) has been produced by author A, a novice in document
design, and passed to a more experienced designer B for revision. The passage looks
odd because it has four very short paragraphs, but short paragraphs are common
in this genre, and B decides that the ugly appearance can be corrected simply by
realizing paragraphs through a vertical space with no tab. In addition, B notices that
boldface has been used for two different purposes: highlighting the product name
and emphasizing only; this ambiguity is removed by changing emphatic boldface to
small caps. Both these revisions, shown in version (7b), concern realization rather than
abstract structure, and consequently they do not affect the validity of the wording.
For final checking the passage is then passed to a senior expert C, whose prefer-
ences are more traditional: in particular, C dislikes short paragraphs and variations
in typeface. Glaring at the waste of space in version (7b), C takes out the paragraph
boundaries and removes the emphasis on only. These are not merely changes in graph-
ical realization: they also affect the abstract document structure. In general, such changes
endanger the validity of the wording. Reading through the new version, C notices that the
pronoun it in the final sentence now seems to refer to aliprosan, not Elixir, so it has
to be replaced by the product name. To reinstate the emphasis in this sentence, C also
inserts the expression N.B. These changes lead to version (7c).
In summary, abstract document structure interacts with wording, whereas visual
realization does not. This principle explains why abstract markup is useful; it also
shows where the boundary should be drawn. By applying this principle, we might
discover that a category previously treated as visual should be reclassified as abstract.
If, for example, the change in the realization of paragraph boundaries in examples
like version (7b) required a rewording of the text, we would have to extend our set
of abstract document categories so that there were two types of paragraph instead of
one.

3. Document Structure and Rhetorical Structure
3.1 Form and Meaning
Logically there are four possible relationships between document structure (DS) and
rhetorical structure (RS): either DS is part of RS, or RS is part of DS, or they partially
overlap, or they are distinct from one another. Our view is that they should be distinct,
just as syntax is distinct from semantics. Document structure, like syntax, describes
the form of a (mainly) linguistic product. Rhetorical structure, like semantics, describes
meaning, interpreting meaning in a broad sense that includes pragmatic features.
As an example, suppose that approve(fda, elixir) is a semantic formula meaning that
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves the medicine Elixir. This semantic
formula can be realized (in English) through a range of syntactic forms, including
[S [NP [DET the][N FDA]][VP [V approves][NP Elixir]]]
which would yield ?the FDA approves Elixir?; alternative syntactic forms could be
obtained by replacing descriptions with pronouns, or by putting the whole sentence
into the passive (e.g., ?it is approved by the FDA?). Now, suppose that we add a
second semantic formula contain(elixir, gestodene), and suppose that the author knows
that gestodene is a controversial ingredient. On this basis, a rhetorical relation of
concession might be applied to the two formulas:
concession(contain(elixir, gestodone), approve(fda, elixir))
where the second argument of concession is the central one and is supported by the
first argument.3 To realize this more complex message, we may need a linguistic form
that cannot be described only by a syntactic phrase marker. In other words, we need
to consider document structure as well as syntax. Ignoring possibilities for variations
in the wording of the constituent propositions and assuming that concession may be
marked with the discourse connectives although and however, we can choose among
the following realizations of the whole message:
(8)
(a) Although Elixir contains gestodene, it is approved by the FDA.
(b) The FDA approves Elixir although it contains gestodene.
(c) Elixir contains gestodene; however, it is approved by the FDA.
(d) Elixir contains gestodene. However, it is approved by the FDA.
(e) Elixir contains gestodene.
However, it is approved by the FDA.
In versions (8a) and (8b), the rhetorical relationship is realized within a single
syntactic sentence, although before adding punctuation we need to know that this
syntactic sentence is also a text-sentence. In versions (8c)?(8e), the arguments of the
concession relation are expressed in separate syntactic sentences, so that the rela-
tionship is realized through document structure as well as syntax. In each case, the
3 These are termed nucleus and satellite in RST (Mann and Thompson 1987).
218
Computational Linguistics Volume 29, Number 2
units realizing the arguments are coordinated in document structure, satellite precedes
nucleus, and the discourse connective however is placed within the nucleus.
Our claim, then, is that document structure combines with syntax in the real-
ization of the meaning of a document, and that rhetorical structure should be re-
garded as part of meaning, not part of document structure. However, as we will now
show, this principle of clear separation of meaning and form has not always been
observed.
3.2 Rhetorical Structure Theory
Rhetorical structure theory (Mann and Thompson 1986, 1987) was developed as a
method of analyzing the rhetorical organization of texts. Formally, the theory is re-
markably simple. It proposes that a text can be analyzed, by rhetorical function, into
a set of nested spans, each span being represented by a node on an ordered tree. Each
nonterminal node on this tree is labeled with a single term describing the relationship
that holds among its constituents. These constituents may have equal importance, in
which case the relation is said to be multinuclear, or one may be rhetorically subor-
dinated to the other, in which case they are said to fulfill the roles of satellite and
nucleus. Although this scheme is obviously intended as a first approximation, it has
been widely adopted, not only by literary analysts, but also by computational linguists,
especially in the NLG community.
One aspect of RST, perhaps more presentational than substantial, has led, in our
view, to confusion: both in the text of their article and the accompanying diagrams,
Mann and Thompson seem to assert that rhetorical relations hold between spans of
text, rather than between the meanings of these texts. In other words, they treat rhetor-
ical structure as part of document structure. Mann and Thompson assert this explicitly
(1987, page 4):
Relations are defined to hold between two non-overlapping text spans,
here called the nucleus and the satellite, denoted by N and S.
where
A text span is an uninterrupted linear sequence of text.
However, it is unclear whether their claim is intentional or simply the result of an
informal style of presentation.
Would it make any sense to treat rhetorical relations as holding literally between
text spans? For clearly pragmatic relations, such as restatement, this seems a possible
position. A text span, after all, is an instrument of the writer, so it makes sense to make
a statement about the function that the instrument is supposed to serve. For clearly
semantic relations, such as nonvolitional-cause, the position is harder to maintain.
In a text like ?Mary was sad because she lost her doll?, the causal relation plainly holds
between two events, not between two spans of text.
Leaving aside intuitive plausibility, the crucial question, we think, is whether the
argument in a document can be formalized without reference to the particular text
spans through which it is realized. Could the same argument be realized by two
English texts with a different structure, or by an English text and a French text? Could
someone forget a text but remember its argument? If so, it must be possible to treat
relations like concession and nonvolitional-cause as holding between ideas rather
than units of text. Rather than creating two kinds of rhetorical relation, it seems more
parsimonious to treat the relation between ideas as primary, so that the argument of

a document can be planned before the writer (or NLG system) has considered issues
of wording or linear order.4
To illustrate this point, let us go back to example (8). Suppose that we want to
show that versions (8b) and (8c) express the same argument.
(8b) The FDA approves Elixir although it contains gestodene.
(8c) Elixir contains gestodene; however, it is approved by the FDA.
Figure 2 shows RST annotations for these texts, on the assumption that rhetorical
relations hold between text spans; note, incidentally, that since related spans must
be consecutive, the discourse connectives although and however have to be included
somewhat arbitrarily in one span or the other. These annotations fail to bring out that
the two texts express the same argument, since at a textual level the spans in (8b) and
(8c) are simply different, both in wording and position.
In Figure 3, instead, different document structures are specified for versions (8b)
and (8c) and linked to a common rhetorical structure; the dotted arrows express the
relation realizes, so that, for example, each text-sentence realizes the whole rhetori-
cal structure governed by the concession relation. Note that rhetorical structures are
always unordered, whereas document structures are ordered trees. Thus the two un-
ordered propositions in the rhetorical structure of Figure 3 are realized in different
orders in the two document structures.
This distinction between rhetorical structure and document structure accounts for
some of the difficulties encountered when RST is applied as an analytic tool. The
core of the problem is that when faced with a text to analyze, the analyst applies the
principles of RST analysis to the text itself rather than to the message underlying the
text. What the analyst really needs to do is, in some way, to ?get behind the text?
to its constituent propositions and the rhetorical relations that hold between them
(Scott and Paris 1995). But instead, by applying relations to text-spans, he or she is
heavily constrained by the evident document structure of the text, and the result is a
rhetorical structure that is isomorphic to the document structure. However, as we have

seen from the above example, the underlying rhetorical structure is not necessarily
isomorphic to the document structure;5 this means that the analysis obtained in this
way is not necessarily an accurate representation of the actual discourse structure
of the text. Consider, for example, the following excerpt from a patient information
leaflet:
(9) IF you find your condition gets worse during treatmentA you may be allergic to the
creamD or have a skin infectionE.
STOP USING THE CREAMB AND TELL YOUR DOCTOR AS SOON AS POSSIBLEC
(Betnovate leaflet, Glaxo; from APBI 1997)
Careful reading of the text, combined with world knowledge, suggests that the
following logical condition holds between the propositional content of A and the pair
B and C:
IF <condition of patient worsens during treatment>
THEN <patient must stop taking cream>
AND <patient must tell patient?s doctor>
ENDIF
In other words, the rhetorical relation of condition holds between A as satellite and
the complex of B and C (joined by a list relation) as nucleus. We learn additionally
that the reason why the patient must carry out the imperative actions of B and C is
that he or she may be either allergic to the cream (D) or have a skin infection (E). In
other words, there is a causal relation between the complex of B and C (the effect) and
complex of D and E (the cause). Representing all this in RST would yield the structure
in Figure 4.
Most people would probably agree that what is depicted in the RST structure
shown in Figure 4 captures the intended meaning of the text in the example, and that
the text itself is of reasonable quality. However, a traditional RST analysis (i.e., of the
text itself, as opposed to its underlying meaning) would not be able to produce the
structure shown here. To explicate, let us go through what the typical RST analyst
would do with this text.
The analyst would probably start by segmenting the text into elementary ?text
spans? (i.e., clauses); this would lead to the same assignment of A?E given above. The
next step would focus on the first sentence: the discourse marker if clearly suggests
the condition relation; similarly, the marker or suggests the alternative relation.
So far so good. However, the next step would be to find a relation that holds among

the text spans in the sentence; if this cannot be done, then according to the tenets of
RST, the text is not coherent. Following this rule, the analyst is likely to make D and E
the components of the identified (multinuclear) alternative relation. Next he would
attempt to assign the satellite and nucleus of the identified condition relation; the
choice would be between A and the complex of D and E. Since the marker if must
attach to the satellite of condition, the answer seems clear:
condition(alternative(D,E),A)
(corresponding to the RST structure shown in Figure 5). But it is also clearly wrong,
since we know from our semantic analysis that what really holds is that shown in
Figure 4:
condition(list(B,C),A)
Indeed, even the layout of the text reinforces, through the use of capital letters, the
strong relationship between A and the pair B and C.
In principle, an RST structure that is derived from the analysis of a given text
should, when used as the input to an NLG system, produce the very same text and
other semantically equivalent versions of it. By separating rhetorical structure from doc-
ument structure, we can now provide a coherent framework for achieving this result.
222
Computational Linguistics Volume 29, Number 2
For instance, we can now produce not only the original text of example (9) (shown
here with neutral layout):
(9b) If you find your condition gets worse during treatment, you may be
allergic to the cream or have a skin infection. Stop using the cream and
tell your doctor as soon as possible.
but also the following (in some contexts perhaps better) variant
(9c) If you find your condition gets worse during treatment, stop using the
cream and tell your doctor as soon as possible; you may be allergic to
the cream or have a skin infection.
Of course, NLG systems that ignore the level of document structure would still be able
to produce the text in version (9b) from the RST structure in Figure 5, but they would
not be able to produce version (9c). Moreover, they could also end up producing the
following incorrect text:6
(9c) # Stop using the cream and tell your doctor as soon as possible because
you may be allergic to the cream or have a skin infection if your
condition gets worse during treatment.
A number of other researchers have identified cases in which ?orthodox? RST
analysis of a text is problematic (e.g., Moore and Pollack 1992; Moser and Moore 1996;
Knott et al 2001). For example, Knott et al (2001) report on texts from a corpus of
museum labels that violate the RST principle of continuous constituency (i.e., adjacent
units must be linked by a relation) but are nonetheless coherent. These are cases in
which the satellite of a relation is not adjacent to its own nucleus in the text. In
all the texts that Knott et al discuss, the ?dislocated? relation is elaboration, and
they attribute the source of the problem to the relation itself: elaboration is not, they
claim, a proper relation; it is a very weak relation that commands a different treatment
from the other stronger ones.
Although there may well be a strong case to be made for the ?demotion? of
elaboration and for a special treatment of it in NLG systems, the phenomenon
of dislocated satellites that Knott et al (2001) describe is not, in fact, confined to
elaboration. Indeed, it corresponds precisely to the problem we have just seen with
example (9), which involves not elaboration, but condition. We have also reported
elsewhere other similar examples of nonisomorphic rhetorical and document structures
(Bouayad-Agha, Power, and Scott 2000). In all cases that we have seen, the principles of
RST (e.g., compositionality, nuclearity, continuous constituency) appear to be violated
only because they are being applied (in the orthodox manner) to the surface text
(i.e., at the level of document structure) rather than more properly to the underlying
propositional structure of the text (i.e., at the level of rhetorical structure).
But why would one want to produce a text whose document structure is not iso-
morphic with its rhetorical structure? One rather practical reason is that as a rhetorical
structure becomes more complex, it becomes increasingly difficult for the writer to pro-
duce a text that satisfies both the demands of coherence (as defined by theories such
6 This text would result from systems that treat the leaves of a rhetorical or text plan as ordered.

as RST) and those of syntax. This happens quite frequently, for example, with condi-
tionals: syntax dictates that expressions using the subordinating discourse marker if
must have the antecedent and consequent in the same sentence. For example:
(10) If you eat too many sweets, you will become ill.
but not
(11) # If you eat too many sweets. You will become ill.
As the consequent or its antecedent becomes more complex, the chances of satis-
fying the syntactic constraints are reduced. Here is a typical example from a PIL:
(12) If you get any of the following:
Stomach pain, indigestion, heartburn or feeling sick for the first time.
Any sign of bleeding in the stomach or intestine, for example, passing black
stools.
. . .
An unexpected change in the amount of urine produced and/or its
appearance.
STOP taking the tablets and tell your doctor.
(Voltarol leaflet, Geigy; from APBI 1997)
Here the conditional is expressed within one big sentence that itself contains several
other sentences?indeed, paragraphs?each describing a set of symptoms organized
around areas of the body. In writing this text, the author has clearly chosen to remain
faithful to the rhetorical structure at the expense of syntax.
At other times, such as the example in Figure 6, taken from Knott et al (2001), it
is the rhetorical structure that loses out. In this case, the author has decided that the
content of the satellite associated with (9) warrants its own paragraph (perhaps for
reasons to do with its size).
4. Formal Theory of Document Structure
We will describe here the formal theory of document structure that we have developed
as part of the ICONOCLAST system (Power 2000; Bouayad-Agha, Power, and Scott
2000; Bouayad-Agha 2000; Bouayad-Agha, Scott, and Power 2001), which generates
multiple versions of the same message in different styles (i.e., with different wording
and layout). In describing the theory, we will concentrate on units above the level
of text-sentence; our treatment of the lower levels varies only slightly from that in
Nunberg?s theory, which is described in great detail in Nunberg (1990).
4.1 Basic Hierarchy of Document Units
Informally it seems clear that units of document structure are ranked: sentences are
grouped into paragraphs, paragraphs into sections, sections into chapters, and so forth.
The hierarchy of categories differs from one document type to another, but there is
always some hierarchy;7 there might for instance be subsubsections and subsections
7 Exceptionally, some elements?in particular, footnotes and pictures?will be ?floating.?

between paragraphs and sections. As a basis for discussion, let us assume a hierarchy
of six levels, which we will number from 0 (assumed to be the lowest possible level
of document structure) to 5:8
0 text-phrase
1 text-clause
2 text-sentence
3 paragraph
4 section
5 chapter
The fundamental organizing principle of document structure is that a unit of a
given level is composed of one or more units of the next level down. This observation
could be expressed by a set of constituent structure rules, one for each level:
chapter ? section+
section ? paragraph+ (etc.)
Alternatively, we could generalize over this set of rules by introducing the symbol LN
to denote a unit of level N (so that L0 means text-phrase, L1 means text-clause, etc.).
A single rule will now cover units of all levels:
LN ? LN?1+ (N > 0)
8 We use text-sentence and text-clause in Nunberg?s sense, as units typically marked by a period and a
semicolon. However, unlike Nunberg, we use text-phrase for any constituent of a text-clause, whether it
is marked by a comma or not.

Two consequences of this rule should be noted. First, it disallows document struc-
tures in which a unit contains a subunit of higher level?for instance, a text-sentence
may not contain a paragraph. Second, it disallows document structures in which
coordinated units have different levels. A section, for example, may not be formed
by coordinating two paragraphs and a text-sentence, as in Figure 7(a); the sentence
should be the only constituent of a further paragraph unit, as in Figure 7(b), so
that when the abstract document structure is realized graphically, the sentence will
be formatted with a paragraph break as well as with a capital letter and a
period.
This deals with the basic organization of text into hierarchical document units;
however, a full description should take account of many other patterns including
headings, bulleted lists, footnotes, and figures. We cannot deal with all these pat-
terns here, so we focus on what is probably the most complex problem: the treat-
ment of indented structures such as quotations, bulleted lists, and enumerated
lists.
4.2 Indented Document Units
At first sight it might seem that indentation is a feature of graphical realization
rather than underlying structure: in other words, that it belongs to concrete rather
than abstract document structure. We have several reasons for rejecting this view.
First, it is at least suggestive that both LaTEX and HTML include tags for indented
structures:
Pattern HTML tag LATEX tag
Quotation <QUOTE> \begin{quote}
Bulleted list <UL> \begin{itemize}
Enumerated list <OL> \begin{enumerate}
Description list <DL> \begin{description}
Second, one can find examples of vertical lists that seem structurally equivalent to
(say) a bulleted list but are presented without item markers and without the use of
horizontal indentation. Here is a case in point, taken from a PIL with formatting exactly
226

preserved:
(13) If you experience any of the following or any other unusual effects,

Poor appetite or a slight sick feeling

Diarrhoea
Itching or rash
Pain in your muscles or joints
If you notice yellowing of the skin or eyes, tell your doctor
straight away.
(Lamisil, Sandoz; from APBI 1997)
Third, and most important of all, indented structures may introduce apparent viola-
tions of the hierarchical ranking described in the last section: for instance, a sentence
may contain a paragraph, provided that the paragraph is indented. We have already seen
this in the case of complex conditionals in example (12). However, the phenomenon
is much more widespread:

good fortune, must be in want of a wife. However little known the feelings
or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this
truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is
considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
is one of the most famous paragraphs in English literature.
In these examples, too, note that the important issue is not graphical indentation, but
what we might call logical indentation. Thus in the case of the quotation, the logical
indentation of the quoted paragraph might be shown without graphical indentation
(e.g., by using a distinctive font or character size):

of some one or other of their daughters.
is one of the most famous paragraphs in English literature.
How can the formation rules for document structure be extended so as to ac-
commodate these patterns? Our main proposal, implemented in the ICONOCLAST
document planner, is that a document unit should be defined by (at least) two fea-
tures: its level and its indentation. The level is the usual ranking from L0 (text-phrase)

to L5 (chapter) or whatever hierarchy of units the author decides to employ; the inden-
tation is a value in the range I0 . . . IMax, where I0 means that the unit is not indented at
all, I1 means it is indented one place, and so forth, with IMax representing the deepest
embedding that the author is prepared to contemplate. The passages in examples 14?16
can then be described formally as unindented text-sentences (i.e., units with the cat-
egory [L2, I0]), which have among their constituents indented paragraphs (units with
the category [L3, I1]). Such structures can be permitted if we change the basic rule of
the last section so that a unit of indentation IN always outranks a unit of indentation
IN+1, no matter what their respective levels may be. Instead of one general rule, we
now need two: the first for unindented constituents, the second for indented ones.
Unindented constituents [LN, IM] ? [LN?1, IM]+
Indented constituents [LA, IM] ? [LB, IM+1]+
In the second rule, LA and LB are unrelated, so LB could represent a higher level than
LA (e.g., a paragraph inside a text-sentence). For most document types one would
presumably prefer to set an upper limit on the level of an indented constituent (e.g.,
an indented chapter seems ridiculous); this could be done for instance by adding the
constraint B < 4.
Figures 8 and 9 give document structures for examples (14) and (15), respectively;
the latter also describes example (16), which differs from (15) only in the graphical
realization of the indented paragraph. One feature of these analyses might at first
sight appear strange: they assign the minimal text level L0 to the node representing
the quotation or the bulleted list. How, one might ask, can a paragraph, or indeed a
list of paragraphs, be regarded as a text-phrase? Should it not be a unit higher than the
paragraph, perhaps some kind of section, or better, a new text category vertical list?
On first tackling indented structures, we followed precisely this reasoning, in-
troducing vertical list as a text category. However, despite its initial plausibility, this
decision has several irritating consequences. First, the concept vertical list has no re-
lationship to the text-level hierarchy. Does it belong between text-sentence and para-
graph, or perhaps between paragraph and section? Any placement seems arbitrary.
Second, since the vertical list in a document structure like that in Figure 8 is clearly
coordinated with a text-phrase, such an analysis would violate the rule that coordi-
nated constituents have the same level. Third, and perhaps most persuasively of all,

it turns out that in their interactions with discourse connectives, vertical lists behave
like text-phrases, not like sentences, paragraphs, or higher units. Thus the vertical list in
Figure 8 is coordinated with the discourse connective since, which would not normally
link constituents higher than text-phrases (we will discuss this constraint more fully
in the next section).9
All these difficulties are removed by denying appearances and assigning the
vertical-list node a text-level of L0. With this treatment, no new arbitrary level in the
hierarchy of units is needed, the basic rule of document structure holds (i.e., coordi-
nated constituents have the same level), and the interaction of the unit with discourse
connectives can be described using the same rules that hold for nonindented struc-
tures. Note also that the difference in indentation between the node and its daughters
is sufficient to identify it as a vertical list; any extra feature (such as a new value in
the text-level hierarchy) would be redundant.
5. Methods of Document Structuring
5.1 Defining the Task
The aim of document structuring within NLG is to create a document structure that
satisfactorily realizes a particular rhetorical structure. This can be achieved through a
variety of architectures, as reflected in the RAGS framework.10 For example, systems
aimed at generating technical abstracts or captions for graphics would probably need
to specify a ?one paragraph only? limit quite early on in the process; in such cases,
document structuring would start before any rhetorical or syntactic decisions were
made (e.g., the RAGS reimplementation of the Caption Generation System [Mellish
et al 2000]). Alternatively, systems that need to generate texts with rich layout might
prefer to interleave document structuring with rhetorical structuring (e.g., Cahill et al
2001).
9 Note that a vertical list can also be coordinated with units larger than text-phrases, such as
text-sentences or paragraphs. The formal rules allow this because a text-phrase can be the only
constituent of a text-clause, which can in turn be the only constituent of a text-sentence, and so forth.
10 See The RAGS Reference Manual, http://www.itri.bton.ac.uk/projects/rags/RefMan/refman.ps.
229
Power, Scott, and Bouayad-Agha Document Structure
For simplicity of presentation, we will assume here an NLG architecture in which a
preliminary module selects simple propositions from a knowledge base and organizes
them into some kind of argument; the document structurer distributes the various
parts of this argument among units like paragraphs and text-sentences; a syntactic
realizer takes over in order to determine the wording of the propositions; finally, a
formatter decides how the abstract categories and features of document structure will
be realized graphically (e.g., whether paragraphs will be marked by a tab on a new
line, or by a vertical space). In the context of such an architecture, two issues are crucial:
what input does the document structurer receive from the earlier planning module,
and how does the output of the document structurer guide syntactic realization?
In ICONOCLAST, our initial assumption, following Scott and Souza (1990), was
that the rhetorical structure would take the form of a graph in which terminal nodes
represent simple propositions and nonterminal nodes represent rhetorical relation-
ships. By organizing all propositions into a single hierarchy, such an input simplifies
the task of the document structuring module; indeed, it could be argued that part
of the work has been done already. An alternative assumption is that the rhetorical
structure takes the form of a set of assertions, each describing a rhetorical relationship
between two propositions (Marcu 1997). With this flat representation, the document
structurer must take more responsibility for grouping the propositions. In this article,
we will focus on the first of these methods (i.e, starting from a hierarchical rhetori-
cal input). The second method (starting from a flat rhetorical input) is described in
Bouayad-Agha (2001).
Regarding the interface between document structuring and syntax, the difficult
issue is where the boundary should be drawn. Above the level of text-clause, it seems
clear that syntax plays little part; however, at the level in which text-phrases combine
to form text-clauses, there is an interplay between the ?syntactic? grammar and the
?text? grammar, as Nunberg (1990) has shown. As an example, consider the simple
rhetorical structure discussed earlier (example (8) and Figure 2):
concession(contain(elixir, gestodene), approve(fda, elixir))
As mentioned earlier, this rhetorical-semantic input could be realized through a text-
sentence comprising two text-clauses:
(8c) Elixir contains gestodene; however, it is approved by the FDA.
In this case it seems clear where the boundary should lie: the document structurer
decides that approve(fda, elixir) should be expressed in the first text-clause, and that
contain(elixir, gestodene) should be expressed in the second, along with the connec-
tive however. It might also impose constraints on the clauses that will realize these
propositions, for instance, by requiring declarative clauses rather than imperative or
interrogative ones. The rest is left to the syntactic realizer, which must decide how the
two propositions should be worded, and how the second clause should be combined
with the connective. Several alternative versions might result, each having exactly the
same document structure:
(8?) Elixir contains gestodene; the FDA, however, approves it.
(8?) Elixir contains gestodene; however, the FDA approves it.
230
Computational Linguistics Volume 29, Number 2
(8??) Gestodene is an ingredient of Elixir; Elixir is approved, however, by the
FDA.
Suppose, however, that the document structurer decides to realize the two propo-
sitions within the same text-clause, as in the following version:
(8??) Elixir is approved by the FDA although it contains gestodene.
Where now does the boundary lie? Should the document structurer create a text-
sentence containing a single text-clause, leave instructions that this text-clause should
express the whole concession relationship, and then wash its hands of the affair, leaving
everything else to the syntactic realizer? Or should it trespass into the domain of
syntactic realization by constructing a syntactic clause of the form S1 although S2, with
instructions that a subclause realizing approve(fda, elixir) should be inserted in position
S1 and a second subclause realizing contain(elixir, gestodene) in position S2?
In ICONOCLAST we have found it more convenient to adopt the latter policy. The
linguistic structure of a document is represented using a single tree in which nodes
may be labeled both with document structure features and with syntactic features.
The document structurer?s task is to build the upper part of this tree, extending from
the root all the way down to the nodes that express simple propositions. In the upper
reaches of the tree, nodes will be labeled with units like section and paragraph, and
syntactic features will be irrelevant; lower down, the document structure may have to
assign some syntactic features when constructing compound clauses. To simplify, we
assume that conjunctive adverbs like however will always be placed at the beginning
of a clause; this means that discourse connectives can be placed into the tree by the
document structurer, thereby limiting the task of the syntactic realizer to the wording
of the simple clauses that realize propositions.
Having clarified the document structurer?s task, we posed the following question:
given a well-formed rhetorical structure, together with a set of formation rules for
document structure and a set of discourse connectives for realizing rhetorical rela-
tions, can we enumerate all document structures that correctly realize the rhetorical
structure?and further, can we evaluate these document structures by some metric so
that we can choose the best? The generation of many alternative solutions was es-
sential to the project, which focused on the problem of controlling style in an NLG
system: by varying a set of stylistic parameters, the user of the system can influence
the evaluation metric that is applied to the set of potential solutions and so influence
the type of solution that will be preferred.
As mentioned above, we have explored two methods of enumerating and evaluat-
ing document structures, one (the focus of this article) assuming a hierarchical input,
the other (described in Bouayad-Agha [2001]) assuming a nonhierarchical input. The
two methods have much in common: they share the same formation rules for doc-
ument structure, the same discourse connectives, and (mainly) the same constraints
on the correct realization of rhetorical relationships. Before describing the hierarchical
method in detail, it will be useful to review the constraints that they share; these con-
straints will be needed, in some form or other, in any system that performs document
structuring.
5.2 Constraints on Realizing Rhetorical Structure
In order to realize a rhetorical structure R(A1, A2) as a document structure, several
decisions must be made:
231
Power, Scott, and Bouayad-Agha Document Structure
? What should be the level (e.g., section, paragraph, text-sentence) of the
document unit that realizes the whole relationship R(A1, A2)?
? What should be the levels of the units realizing the arguments A1 and
A2?
? Should the units realizing A1 and A2 be indented items, or should they
have the same indentation as the unit realizing R(A1, A2)?
? In what linear order should the units realizing A1 and A2 occur?
? Should the rhetorical relation R be expressed using a discourse
connective or left implicit?
? If a discourse connective is used, should it be linked to the span
realizing A1 or the span realizing A2?
These decisions are closely related, as the following examples show:
? If R(A1, A2) is realized through a text-sentence, then the arguments A1
and A2 cannot be realized through a higher unit, such as a paragraph,
unless they are indented one place further than R(A1, A2). (This follows
from the formation rules for document structure.)
? If R is a nucleus-satellite relation rather than a multinuclear one, the
arguments A1 and A2 should not be realized through indented items.11
? If a subordinating conjunction like although is used to express the
relation R, the arguments A1 and A2 should be realized within the same
syntactic clause; hence they should be text-phrases, rather than
text-clauses or some higher unit. Moreover, although should be attached
to the clause expressing A1 (assuming this is the satellite).
Constraints arising from the formation rules for document structure have already
been covered; we will therefore focus here on constraints that concern the realization
of rhetorical relations.
Leaving aside quotations for the time being, our first suggestion is that indentation
should be employed only for the arguments of a multinuclear relation. Vertical lists are
typically used when the items in the list play the same role in the discourse?for
instance, they might be symptoms of a disease or potential side effects of a medicine.
By definition, the arguments of a nucleus-satellite relation have different purposes; the
nucleus makes the main point, whereas the satellite?s role is supportive. Consider, for
example, the following rhetorical structure:
justify(list(tested(elixir), approve(fda, elixir)), safe(elixir))
which gives two reasons why Elixir is safe to use. The LIST relation is multinuclear,
whereas JUSTIFY is nucleus-satellite; according to our rule, then, the document struc-
tures in (17) and (18) should be avoided, whereas those in (19) and (20) should be
11 This constraint is based on the intuition that the items in a vertical list should have parallel roles in the
argument, a condition that clearly fails to hold for a nucleus-satellite relation.
232
Computational Linguistics Volume 29, Number 2
acceptable:
(17) ? Elixir is safe to use
? because it has been carefully tested and is approved by the FDA.
(18) ? Elixir has been carefully tested and is approved by the FDA,
? therefore, it is safe to use.
(19) Elixir is safe to use because
? it has been carefully tested
? it is approved by the FDA
(20) ? Elixir has been carefully tested
? Elixir is approved by the FDA
Therefore, it is safe to use.
Note that when the arguments of a multinuclear relation are presented within a
text-clause, syntax requires a connective like and or or. When they are presented as
indented items, the connective is instead often omitted, leaving the relation implicit;
the reader has to use common sense to divine whether the list represents a conjunction
or a disjunction.
5.2.1 Discourse Connectives. A comprehensive treatment of discourse connectives
will not be attempted here, but we will cover the three main categories identified by
Knott (1996): subordinating conjunctions, coordinating conjunctions, and conjunctive
adverbs.
The properties of a discourse connective can be fully specified by four features:
MEANING, SYNTAX, LOCUS, and SPELLING. As examples, here are three definitions for
the CONCESSION relation:
MEANING concession
SYNTAX subordinating conjunction
LOCUS satellite
spelling ?although?
meaning concession
syntax coordinating conjunction
locus nucleus
spelling ?but?
meaning concession
syntax conjunctive adverb
locus nucleus
spelling ?however?
The locus specifies which argument of the relation carries the discourse connec-
tive. For a nucleus-satellite relation, the argument is identified either by nucleus or
satellite; for a multinuclear relation it is identified by an ordinal specification such
as initial or final.
For each type of discourse connective, it is possible to state specific constraints on
the order of arguments, and on the document units that express them.12
12 Some of these are also mentioned by Scott and Souza (1990) and Rosner and Stede (1992).
233
Power, Scott, and Bouayad-Agha Document Structure
5.2.1.1 Subordinating Conjunction. The spans linked by a subordinating conjunction
can be arranged in either order (nucleus first or satellite first) but must be expressed
within the same text-clause. For example:
(21) Although it has no significant side effects, never give Elixir to other patients.
(22) Never give Elixir to other patients, although it has no significant side effects.
(23) # Although it has no significant side effects; never give Elixir to other patients.
(24) # Although it has no significant side effects. Never give Elixir to other patients.
(25) # Never give Elixir to other patients; although it has no significant side effects.
(26) # Never give Elixir to other patients. Although it has no significant side effects.
5.2.1.2 Coordinating Conjunction. Spans linked by a coordinating conjunction can oc-
cur in the same text-clause or in different text-clauses (or higher units) but must be
ordered so that the discourse connective is located in the final span (i.e., the second
span in the case of a nucleus-satellite relation):
(27) Elixir has no significant side effects, but never give it to other patients.
(28) # But never give Elixir to other patients, it has no significant side effects.
(29) Elixir has no significant side effects; but never give it to other patients.
(30) # But never give Elixir to other patients; it has no significant side effects.
(31) Elixir has no significant side effects. But never give it to other patients.
(32) # But never give Elixir to other patients. It has no significant side effects.
Of course examples (28), (30), and (32) are prohibited only as a means of realizing
a concession relation between the two propositions. They might be acceptable in a
text realizing a different rhetorical structure in which the satellite had already been
expressed.
5.2.1.3 Conjunctive Adverb. Spans linked by a conjunctive adverb can occur in differ-
ent text-clauses (or higher units), but not in the same text-clause. For a nucleus-satellite
relation they must be ordered so that the discourse connective is located in the second
span:
(33) # Elixir has no significant side-effects, however, never give it to other patients.
(34) # However, never give Elixir to other patients, it has no significant side-effects.
(35) Elixir has no significant side-effects; however, never give it to other patients.
(36) # However, never give Elixir to other patients; it has no significant side-effects.
(37) Elixir has no significant side-effects. However, never give it to other patients.
(38) # However, never give Elixir to other patients. It has no significant side-effects.
Again, examples (33), (34), (36), and (38) would be acceptable in realizations of different
rhetorical structures in which the satellite had already been presented.
5.3 Planning Document Structure Using Hierarchical Input
Using the hierarchical method, the input rhetorical structure is a tree in which the
terminal nodes are formulas representing elementary propositions (i.e., propositions
having no internal rhetorical complexity), whereas the nonterminal nodes are labeled
with rhetorical relations (see, for example, Figure 10). This tree is unordered: the roles

of daughter nodes are shown by labels on the arcs (nucleus or satellite in the
case of a nucleus-satellite relation, or an integer greater than zero in the case of a
multinuclear relation).
The output is a linguistic structure, represented formally by an ordered tree in
which each node corresponds to a span of the document. Nodes are labeled with
document structure features (e.g., the level and indentation of the unit) and also with
syntactic features, which usually become relevant only at the level of text-clause or
below. Discourse connectives are already selected and positioned correctly in the tree;
the only task left to the syntactic realizer is to elaborate the tree further by generating
clauses that express the elementary propositions.
Our aim in ICONOCLAST has been to find a document-structuring method that
will generate all document structures that correctly realize an input rhetorical struc-
ture, given certain simplifying assumptions about the composition of the document
structure and the discourse connectives available in the lexicon. During this initial
enumeration of potential solutions, we are not concerned with good style: the pro-
cedure should generate clumsy realizations as well as elegant ones. But we do re-
quire a minimal standard of correctness. There is no point in considering solutions
that leave propositions in the rhetorical structure unexpressed in the document struc-
ture or group them wrongly. The strategy is first to define a procedure that gen-
erates all solutions that are worth considering at all; using this minimally correct
set as a basis, we can then posit further constraints that impose particular stylistic
preferences.
We assume that a minimally correct solution must satisfy three conditions:
1. The terminal nodes of the document structure must express all the
propositions in the rhetorical structure.
2. In addition to satisfying the document structure formation rules, the
solution must conform to correct syntax within text-clauses. For example,
two elementary propositions within a text clause must be linked by a
conjunction placed in the right position.
3. The document structure must be structurally compatible with the
rhetorical structure.
The first two of these conditions are obvious, but the third needs clarification. What
exactly is meant by ?structurally compatible??
We have explored two definitions of structural compatibility that are closely re-
lated to the mathematical notions of isomorphism and homomorphism (Landman

1991; Bouayad-Agha, Power, and Scott 2000). Each notion can be conveniently ex-
pressed in terms of groupings of propositions in the rhetorical structure and the dis-
course structure. For an isomorphism (the strongest definition of compatibility), two
conditions must hold:
1. If a node in the document structure represents a span in which the set of
propositions expressed is P, there must be a corresponding node in the
rhetorical structure that dominates exactly the same set P of propositions.
2. If a node in the rhetorical structure dominates a set P of propositions,
there must be a node in the document structure representing a span in
which exactly this set P is expressed.
Informally, for an isomorphism, all groupings of propositions in the rhetorical struc-
ture must be transmitted faithfully to the document structure, and no new groupings
should be introduced. For a homomorphism from rhetorical structure to document
structure, only the first condition is required to be fulfilled. Any grouping found in
the document structure must correspond to a grouping in the rhetorical structure, but
the document structure may ?flatten out? the rhetorical structure by leaving some
groupings unexpressed.
These two kinds of compatibility, isomorphism and homomorphism, are illustrated
by document structures (a) and (b), respectively, in Figure 11, which are alternative
realizations of the rhetorical structure in Figure 10; to simplify, discourse connectives
have been left out. Solution (a) is isomorphic with the rhetorical structure, since the
propositions dominated by the justify relation are grouped together in a separate
text-sentence. Solution (b) is homomorphic only with the rhetorical structure, since
the propositions are expressed in three separate text-sentences, the internal grouping
236

remaining implicit. Here are two texts that might result:
(39)
(a) Elixir contains gestodene; therefore, it is banned by the FDA. However, the FDA ap-
proves ElixirPlus.
(b) Elixir contains gestodene. Therefore, it is banned by the FDA. However, the FDA ap-
proves ElixirPlus.
Note that by losing a grouping from the rhetorical structure, (39b) introduces an
ambiguity: its form would also be consistent with an alternative rhetorical structure in
which the relation justify dominated concession. From the point of view of express-
ing the rhetorical input precisely, the isomorphic solution is always better. However,
when the resulting document structure is complex, or when the correct interpretation
can be inferred easily from the content, there might be stylistic reasons for preferring
a looser homomorphic solution. As a criterion for generating all minimally correct
solutions, therefore, we believe the homomorphic definition of compatibility is more
appropriate.13
Having decided what counts as a correct solution, our next task is to find an
efficient algorithm that will generate all and only these solutions. In ICONOCLAST,
this is accomplished through a constraint-solving method that formalizes the options
for realizing each part of the rhetorical structure, then eliminates those combined
choices that violate constraints. The technique has been explained fully elsewhere
(Power 2000), so we will confine ourselves here to a sketch of the main points.
For each node NR on the rhetorical structure, we can lay out some options on
how the rhetorical fragment dominated by this node will be realized in the document
structure. The crucial choices are as follows:
? What should be the level and indentation of the document structure
node that realizes the proposition or relationship NR?
? If NR is a nonterminal node, labeled with a rhetorical relation, what
discourse connective (if any) should express this relation in the
document structure?
? If NR is nonterminal, in what linear order should its daughter nodes be
realized in the document structure?
These decisions can be formalized by associating with each node four variables that
we will call level, indentation, connective, and position. The potential values
of these variables represent options for realizing the relevant part of the rhetorical
structure, and these options will be reduced by considering constraints on which com-
binations of values are allowed. Initially, the possibilities are as follows:
level: The level of the document structure unit realizing NR will be a document
unit along the hierarchy from text-phrase to chapter. In the program, it
13 We actually believe that even the less strict requirement of a homomorphism from RS to DS is too
strong, because one occasionally finds natural texts that violate it. For example, in Figure 4, RS and DS
are not only nonisomorphic, but nonhomomorphic, because there is a grouping in the DS (propositions
A, D, E) that is not found in the RS (no node in the RS dominates just these three propositions). This
raises the question of how one can distinguish nonhomomorphic solutions that are acceptable (like that
in Figure 4) from ones that are unacceptable (probably the great majority). To defer this difficult issue,
we have preferred in this article to confine our attention to homomorphic solutions. For further
discussion see Bouayad-Agha, Power, and Scott (2000).
237
Power, Scott, and Bouayad-Agha Document Structure
is convenient to represent this with an integer, so that constraints on a
higher or lower level can be implemented using the operations > and <;
we will here continue the notation introduced in Section 4.1, in which L0
means text-phrase, L1 means text-clause, and so forth.
indentation: The indentation of the document structure unit will be a value in
the range I0 to IMax, as explained in Section 4.2. Again, in the implemen-
tation, it is convenient to use an integer.
connective: The value of this variable is either ?, meaning that no connective
should be used, or a word from the lexicon. Thus if the node NR has
the label concession, the potential values might be ?, although, but, and
however.
position: This variable represents the order in which NR will be realized in the
document structure, in comparison with its sisters. The value must lie in
the range 1 . . .S, where S is the total number of sisters (including NR).
Thus if NR is an argument in a nucleus-satellite relation, the range will be
1 . . . 2; if it is an argument in a multinuclear relation, the range may be
larger.
The solution process consists in determining the set of options for each variable (these
are known in constraint logic programming as the domain of the variable), then im-
posing constraints on combinations of values, then enumerating all combinations that
satisfy the constraints. Each admissible combination of values can then be used as a
blueprint for building one of the document structures that may realize the input rhetor-
ical structure. The constraints imposed during the second phase of this algorithm are
essentially those described in the last section.
6. Examples of Document Structuring
We now give two examples of the document-structuring method outlined in the last
section. First, we look in detail at a very simple task, to make it clear how the method
works. Then we show some output for a more complex task, for which the program
will generate dozens of solutions even if the wording of individual propositions is
held constant.
6.1 Simple Example
To view the document-structuring method from close up, we will use a simplified
version of the task discussed in the last section. The rhetorical structure will comprise
just two propositions linked by a concession relation:
concession(ban(fda, elixir), approve(fda, elixirplus))
The method works by computing the options for realizing each constituent of the
rhetorical structure, where a constituent is any node in the rhetorical structure tree
along with its descendents. Thus in the present example there are three constituents?
the two propositions and the whole relationship?and for convenience we will label
them as follows:
A: approve(fda, elixirplus)
B: ban(fda, elixir)
C: concession(ban(fda, elixir), approve(fda, elixirplus))
238
Computational Linguistics Volume 29, Number 2
We can now begin to characterize the units in the document structure that will
realize the rhetorical constituents A, B, and C. For each unit, four choices must be
made: its level, its indentation, its position in relation to its sisters, and its connective.
We therefore have a total of twelve variables. Any combination of values that satis-
fies the constraints (as discussed in the last section) will serve as the blueprint for a
solution.
Following the usual technique for solving constraint satisfaction problems (Hen-
tenryck 1989), we assign to each variable a domain of potential values:
Constituent Level Indentation Position Connective
A (approve) {L0 . . . L3} {I0, I1} {P1, P2} C0
B (ban) {L0 . . . L3} {I0, I1} {P1, P2} C0
C (concession) {L0 . . . L3} {I0, I1} P1 {C0, Calt, Cbut, Chow}
Some of these assignments require some explanation:
? We make the simplifying assumption that the highest unit required will
be the paragraph (formalized as level L3), and that the maximum
indentation will be one place (formalized as I1).
? Since constituents A and B are sisters in the rhetorical structure, their
relative order is formalized by a choice between two positions, P1 and
P2. Constituent C, in contrast, has no sister in the rhetorical structure, so
as an ?only child,? it can have only one position value.
? Constituents A and B are not associated with a discourse connective,
because they are elementary propositions, so their value for the
connective variable is C? (meaning no connective). Constituent C is instead
associated with the concession relation, for which we assume that the
lexicon offers three connectives: although (Calt), but (Cbut), and however
(Chow). The initial domain for the variable connective(C) therefore
comprises these three possibilities along with C?, the option of leaving
the relation implicit.
Having assigned the initial domains, we next proceed to apply some constraints;
these will have the effect of reducing some of the domains. First of all, there are some
constraints applicable to the unit that will serve as the root of the whole document
structure:
Root Level: In a document generation task, we usually have some preconception
about the size of the whole document (e.g., it might be a chapter, or a
section). Since this is a small rhetorical structure, we might decree that the
whole text should consist of a paragraph, so that level(C) = L3.
Root Indentation: It makes no sense for a whole document to be an indented item,
so to realize the root constituent C we may stipulate that indentation(C) =
I0.
Having applied these constraints to the variables realizing C, we can impose some
further constraints that arise from the relationship between C and its direct constituents
A and B:
239
Power, Scott, and Bouayad-Agha Document Structure
Argument Indentation: As pointed out in the last section, it is permissible to
indent the arguments of a multinuclear relation, but not a nucleus-satellite
relation. Therefore, given that the indentation of C has been fixed as I0,
the indentations of A and B must also be I0.
Parental Domination: Since A and B are constituents of C in the rhetorical struc-
ture, the units realizing A and B in the document structure will occur
within the constituent realizing C. Given that all indentations have been
set to I0, this means that level(C) should outrank both level(A) and level(B),
and that consequently the option L3 should be removed from the domains
of the last two variables.
Sister Equality: Because A and B are sisters in the rhetorical structure (i.e., argu-
ments of the same relation), it is appropriate that they should be realized
in the document structure by units of the same level. We can therefore im-
pose the constraint level(A) = level(B). This does not immediately affect
the domains of these variables, but it does mean that as soon as one is
fixed, so is the other.
Sister Position: The units realizing the sisters A and B must occur in one of two
linear orders in the document structure?they cannot both come first, or
both second. We may therefore set the constraint position(A) = position(B).
Again this has no immediate effect on the domains, but as soon as one
value is fixed, so is the other.
Obligatory Connective: As Scott and Souza (1990) point out, an NLG system is
ill-equipped to judge when a rhetorical relation may be left implicit, so it
makes sense to play safe by always realizing the relation using a discourse
connective. Following this policy, we can remove C0 from the domain of
connective(C).
Through applying these constraints, the domains of the variables have been reduced
as follows:
Constituent Level Indentation Position Connective
A (approve) {L0 . . . L2} I0 {P1, P2} C0
B (ban) {L0 . . . L2} I0 {P1, P2} C0
C (concession) L3 I0 P1 {Calt, Cbut, Chow}
Before enumerating solutions, we need to impose a final set of constraints that are
conditional on the choice of discourse connective for C. These constraints have been
explained fully above, so here we only point out how they are stated in terms of our
variables.
Subordinating Conjunction: The units connected by although may occur in any
order, but they must be text-phrases. Therefore, if connective(C) = Calt,
then level(A) = level(B) = L0.
Coordinating Conjunction: We will assume that a coordinating conjunction like
but may link spans within a text-clause, or across text-clauses and text-
sentences, so that no constraint on the levels of A and B results. However,
the satellite must precede the nucleus, so we have position(B) = P1 (and
hence, by Sister Position, position(A) = P2).
240
Computational Linguistics Volume 29, Number 2
Conjunctive Adverb: A conjunctive adverb like however should link spans in units
of text-clause or higher,14 so we can impose the constraints level(A) > L0
and level(B) > L0. (Note that in the implementation, only one of these need
be applied, since the other results from Sister Equality.) For however, the
satellite must precede the nucleus, so again we have position(B) = P1 and
position(A) = P2.
With all potential interactions among decisions taken care of, enumeration can
proceed. In an implementation in constraint logic programming, this is accomplished
through a method called labeling, in which the remaining possible values for each
variable are tried one by one, with backtracking, until all permitted combinations
have been produced. For this example, this process can be understood most easily if
we explore in turn the possible values for connective(C).
Suppose first that connective(C) = Calt (i.e., that we try although). Through the
constraint Subordinating Conjunction, this choice immediately fixes all values of level,
yielding the following domains:
Constituent Level Indentation Position Connective
A (approve) L0 I0 {P1, P2} C0
B (ban) L0 I0 {P1, P2} C0
C (concession) L3 I0 P1 Calt
The only remaining issue is the relative orders of the spans realizing A and B. Enu-
merating arbitrarily on position(A), we first try the value P1; by Sister Position this
immediately yields position(B) = P2, whereupon all values in the table are fixed. We
therefore have our first complete solution:
Constituent Level Indentation Position Connective
A (approve) L0 I0 P1 C0
B (ban) L0 I0 P2 C0
C (concession) L3 I0 P1 Calt
This is still only a blueprint for a document structure, but with these specifications
the rest can be inferred. First, since the units realizing A and B are text-phrases, whereas
the root unit realizing C is a paragraph, the program can interpolate the units needed
to make a well-formed document structure: the paragraph has a single text-sentence,
which has a single text-clause, which comprises the two text-phrases. Next, since
although attaches to the satellite, the program coordinates it with the clause that will
syntactically realize B. The document structure is now complete, and after syntactic
realization of the two propositions we might obtain the following paragraph:
Solution 1: The FDA approves ElixirPlus, although it bans Elixir.
Backing up, the program can now try the alternative order in which position(A) = P2.
After inferring the complete document structure in the same way, we thereby obtain
a second solution:
Solution 2: Although the FDA bans Elixir, it approves ElixirPlus.
14 As Oates (2001) has shown, this is not true if multiple discourse connectives are allowed: For instance,
one might say ?The FDA bans Elixir but, however, it approves ElixirPlus.? But in the present example,
we assume, for simplicity, that only single discourse connectives are used.
241
Power, Scott, and Bouayad-Agha Document Structure
Having fully explored the possibilities with connective(C) = Calt, we back up and
try the next value, namely, Cbut. This time the constraint Coordinating Conjunction
applies, fixing the position values but leaving several possiblities for level:
Constituent Level Indentation Position Connective
A (approve) {L0 . . . L2} I0 P2 C0
B (ban) {L0 . . . L2} I0 P1 C0
C (concession) L3 I0 P1 Cbut
Enumerating on one of the level variables, for instance, level(A), we can now try in
turn the values L0, L1, and L2 (text-phrase, text-clause, and text-sentence); by Sister
Equality, any choice will be copied across to level(B), so that we obtain only three
further solutions rather than nine:
Solution 3: The FDA bans Elixir, but it approves ElixirPlus.
Solution 4: The FDA bans Elixir; but it approves ElixirPlus.
Solution 5: The FDA bans Elixir. But it approves ElixirPlus.
Finally, we try the remaining option, for which connective(C) = Chow. The constraint
Conjunctive Adverb now applies, fixing the order of A and B and ruling out solutions
for which these propositions are realized by text-phrases:
Constituent Level Indentation Position Connective
A (approve) {L1, L2} I0 P2 C0
B (ban) {L1, L2} I0 P1 C0
C (concession) L3 I0 P1 Chow
It remains to enumerate (as before) on level(A), trying in turn the values L1 and L2
(text-clause and text-sentence). Sister Equality again copies any selected value across
to level(B), so that we obtain just two more solutions:
Solution 6: The FDA bans Elixir; however, it approves ElixirPlus.
Solution 7: The FDA bans Elixir. However, it approves ElixirPlus.
Obviously further texts could be obtained by different wordings of the propo-
sitions or different placements of however (e.g., ?The FDA bans Elixir; the FDA ap-
proves ElixirPlus, however?). But these variations do not concern us here, since we
assume they are introduced during syntactic realization, not during document
structuring.
6.2 Complex Example
To examine a more complex example, it is convenient to use a version of ICONOCLAST
in which the wording of individual propositions is prespecified, so that the program?s
only task is to explore the set of possible document structures. The input to this
program is provided in the form of an XML file using the tags RhetRep (for rhetorical
relationships) and SemRep (for propositions) (Cahill et al 1999). The roles of satellite
and nucleus are distinguished implicitly by the order of the elements (satellite precedes
nucleus). Thus the example discussed in the last section
concession(ban(fda, elixir), approve(fda, elixirplus))
242
Computational Linguistics Volume 29, Number 2
Figure 12
Running the document planner.
could be encoded as follows:
<RhetRep relation=concession>
<SemRep prop="the FDA bans Elixir"/>
<SemRep prop="the FDA approves ElixirPlus"/>
</RhetRep>
Obviously this will sometimes lead to some clumsy wording (e.g., through inappro-
priate decisions on whether to use pronouns), but we can try to ignore this when
evaluating the generated document structures.
As a more complicated example we will consider a rhetorical structure with
two nucleus-satellite relations (evidence, concession) and one multinuclear relation
(list):
<RhetRep relation=concession>
<SemRep prop="Elixir contains gestodene"/>
<RhetRep relation=evidence>
<RhetRep relation=list>
<SemRep prop="the medicine has been thoroughly tested"/>
<SemRep prop="it has no significant side effects"/>
</RhetRep>
<SemRep prop="Elixir is safe to use"/>
</RhetRep>
</RhetRep>
The main idea here is that Elixir is safe to use although it contains gestodene; the
claim that Elixir is safe is supported by evidence comprising two conjoined facts: It
has been thoroughly tested, and it has no significant side effects.
Figure 12 shows a snapshot of the program running on this example. Through the
control panel on the left, the user can decide which XML model to use as input; in
the figure, this is set to ?Concession-Evidence-Conjunction,? the name given to this
243
Power, Scott, and Bouayad-Agha Document Structure
input model. Using the button labeled ?Number of versions,? the user can determine
the maximum number of versions that will be generated; since this has been set to
500, the program will return the first 500 solutions that it finds.15 The other buttons
control hard constraints and have been set deliberately to rather restrictive values (e.g.,
indented items have been allowed only to one level of indentation and may consist
only of text-phrases, not larger units like text-sentences or paragraphs). Even with
these restrictive settings, 58 solutions have been generated; they are presented in the
pane on the right, ordered (partially) from best to worst. The scores in parentheses
after the version number report the number of defects that the program detected for
that particular version: thus for each of the solutions that appear in the snapshot,
no defects were found.16 As a comparison, here is version 58, which came up at the
bottom of the class with six defects:
Version 58 (6)
Elixir contains gestodene.
However, the medicine has been thoroughly tested.
It has no significant side effects.
Consequently, Elixir is safe to use.
The specific defects cited here were ?Single-sentence paragraph? (occurring four times)
and ?Lost rhetorical grouping? (occurring twice). (The defects are explained below, and
the full set of solutions is given in the Appendix.)
At present the program looks for six stylistic defects, which are formulated mainly
by looking at generated solutions and making an intuitive judgment as to why they
are bad. We have not tried to give the stylistic assessment a sound theoretical or
empirical basis; the aim at this stage is to confirm that by applying some simple
intuitive principles, we can separate reasonably good solutions from obviously horrible
ones. The six defects are as follows (and we stress again that they are only provisional):
Nucleus precedes satellite: It is generally the case for English that the more im-
portant information is placed at the end of the sentence (i.e., end focus
[Quirk et al 1985]). For example, the rheme of a sentence comes after its
theme, and new information is typically placed after given information
(Halliday 1985; Givo?n 1988). There is also psycholinguistic evidence to
suggest that sentences that conform to this general pattern are processed
more easily (Yekovich, Walker, and Blackman 1979). Since by definition the
nucleus is more important than the satellite (Mann and Thompson 1986,
page 6), it thus makes sense to place the nucleus second. Obviously this
principle is debatable, and the best order might differ from one relation
to another, but we have noticed that for the very common relations such
as concession and evidence, the order satellite-nucleus seems to work
better. The program therefore scores a defect every time that a nucleus is
placed before its satellite.
Left-branching structure: Fodor, Bever, and Garrett (1974) report that left-branching
structures take more time to process and remember than right-branching
15 Obviously, if there are fewer than 500 solutions, it will return all the solutions it finds.
16 When it finds a defect in a version, the system also reports on the type of defect that it finds.
244
Computational Linguistics Volume 29, Number 2
ones. We have also noticed that when a document structure coordinates
two units of different sizes, it reads best when the smaller unit is placed
first. We believe that this may be related to the more general organizational
principle of end weight (Quirk et al 1985). Thus in the program, when
an elementary proposition is coordinated with a unit containing several
propositions, a defect is scored whenever the elementary proposition is
placed second.
Lost rhetorical grouping: As discussed, our method of document structuring does
not demand an isomorphism between rhetorical structure and document
structure; consequently, a grouping that is present in rhetorical structure
may be left implicit in the document structure. Although we allow a group-
ing to be lost in this way, a defect is scored every time it is found to have
occurred.
Single-sentence paragraph: Paragraphs containing a single text-sentence usually
look strange, so they are scored as a defect.
Oversimple text-clauses: We noticed this subtle defect only as a result of experi-
ence with the program. In most cases it looks odd to compose a sentence
from two text-clauses, each expressing a single proposition:
Elixir contains gestodene; therefore, it is banned by the FDA.
The FDA bans Elixir; however, it approves ElixirPlus.
Assuming it is agreed that these sentences are a little strange, why should
this be so? We would suggest the following reason. The semicolon is a
somewhat unusual device, more sophisticated than the comma, and one
therefore expects it to be used only when ordinary methods are unsatis-
factory. In these examples, containing only two propositions, a single text-
clause using conjunctions (e.g., since, although) instead of adverbs would
express the meaning equally clearly, so the semicolon seems unnecessary,
and therefore distracting. A defect is therefore scored every time this is
found to have happened.
Repeated discourse connective: If a rhetorical structure contains two relations of
the same type, one dominating the other, a defect is scored if they are
expressed using the same discourse connective. Here is a simple example
of this defect (repetition of although), followed by an alternative solution
that avoids the defect:
The FDA approves ElixirPlus although it bans Elixir although Elixir has
been thoroughly tested.
The FDA approves ElixirPlus but it bans Elixir although Elixir has been
thoroughly tested.
7. Discussion and Conclusion
Our main aim has been to introduce and motivate abstract document structure as an
important representational level in natural language processing. This proposal rests
on two separate claims: first, that it is useful to distinguish abstract document structure
from concrete graphical realization; second, that abstract document structure should
also be distinguished from rhetorical structure.
245
Power, Scott, and Bouayad-Agha Document Structure
7.1 Abstract versus Concrete
We argue that the transition from a rhetorical-semantic message to a fully specified
document can usefully be divided into two stages. During the first stage, the author
puts the message into words and organizes the words into higher linguistic units like
sentences, paragraphs, and bulleted lists. All decisions pertaining to the realization of
literal content take place during this stage. During the second stage, detailed format-
ting takes place: quotations are realized either by single or double quotes (or some
other method); emphasis is realized through italics, boldface, small capitals, or under-
lining; paragraphs are realized through an introductory tab or double line spacing;
and so forth. Decisions about format do not affect the factual or logical content of the
document, although they might convey ?meanings? of a subtler sort, communicated
through the typographical preferences of the authors (e.g., traditional versus trendy,
ornamental versus puritanical, compact versus expansive).
It is worth noting that similar distinctions are made in other branches of linguistics.
Thus in phonology, a distinction is made between a phonemic level and a phonetic
level. The word grass has a single phonemic representation but will be pronounced
differently by people from different regions or different social classes; these distinctions
are phonetic, not phonemic. To refer to an area in the garden as grass rather than lawn
is one kind of decision; to pronounce grass with a short or long vowel is another. A
theory that mapped directly from the semantic concept to the phonetic form would
miss a generalization that is not only obvious theoretically, but useful practically. The
invention of writing provides additional support for an intermediate phonemic level,
because the different pronunciations of grass are all written down in the same way;
similarly, we would argue, the representational level of abstract document structure
has received more recent support from the invention of markup languages like HTML
and LaTEX.
The concept of abstract document structure is not linked to any particular architec-
ture for natural language generation or understanding. In the RAGS ?reference archi-
tecture? for NLG (Mellish et al 2000; Cahill et al 2001), document structure is distin-
guished from rhetorical structure as a data type, with no commitment as to when these
two data structures are created during the generation process. The ICONOCLAST sys-
tem, described in this article, assumes that rhetorical planning fully precedes document
structuring: in other words, the RST tree has to be complete before the process of cre-
ating a document structure can begin. Such an architecture could be thought of as a
refinement of the standard pipeline (Reiter 1994), with the document-planning phase
divided into two parts (rhetorical planning and document structuring). However, the
ICONOCLAST method would work equally well if a partial assignment of document
structure was part of its input: This would be treated merely as a more specific set of
constraints on possible solutions, which is precisely the arrangement that is used in
the RAGS reimplementation of the Caption Generation System (Mellish et al 2000).
7.2 Document Structure versus Rhetorical Structure
In the terminology of HTML and other mark-up languages, tags like section and
description list are sometimes called logical, suggesting that they are rhetorical
rather than linguistic categories. We have argued that this is a mistake, comparable to
a confusion of syntax with semantics. In our view, the term rhetorical structure should
properly be applied to the higher-level pragmatic and semantic organization of the
message, with no commitment to the means by which this message will be expressed?
whether by speech, or gesture, or diagram, or written document. By contrast, the
categories section and description list are specific to a particular medium, the
written document; hence the term document structure. The two levels are easily confused
246

because we often refer to spans of a document using a noun that describes their
rhetorical role (e.g., summary in an academic paper).
Some of the distinctions made in this article have parallels in work on document
analysis. Various representations for document structure have been proposed in the
document analysis community, of which the most developed is the Document Attribute
Format Specification (DAFS) (Dori et al 1997). In DAFS, the physical structure of a
document is distinguished from its logical structure; typical physical units are block,
frame, page, and page set, and typical logical units are sentence, paragraph, section,
and header. More formally, the units of logical structure, called textons, are organized
into levels from character (level 0), word (level 1), and sentence or phrase (level 2) up
to sections and whole documents; the lower levels (up to paragraph) are called sim-
ple textons, and the higher levels are called compound textons. Simple textons are
realized through blocks of text, whereas compound textons additionally have a head-
ing and (optionally) a trailer. There is considerable overlap here with our distinction
between concrete and abstract document structure; differences arise because the anal-
ysis community is concerned mainly with the relationship between logical structure
and physical structure (to use that community?s terminology), whereas the generation
community, coming from the opposite direction, is concerned mainly with the rela-
tionship between logical structure (i.e., abstract document structure) and rhetorical
structure.
Having drawn these distinctions, we have sketched a formal theory of abstract
document structure and shown through an implemented NLG system that this theory
allows us to enumerate systematically the high-level linguistic structures that can real-
ize a given rhetorical-semantic input. The formal description of document structure is
based on Nunberg?s (1990) text-grammar, which we have extended in two ways. First,
we introduce larger units such as sections and chapters; Nunberg instead focuses on
the levels relevant for punctuation (i.e., text-sentence and below). Secondly, we intro-
duce a second feature, abstract indentation. Whereas Nunberg categorizes units only
according to the feature we have called level (the hierarchy from text-phrase, text-
clause, etc., up to section and chapter), we categorize units according to two features,
level and indentation. This allows the generation of such patterns as bulleted lists,
including more complex cases in which one list is embedded within another. Using
this descriptive scheme, it has proved relatively easy to state constraints on the inter-
action between content, layout, and wording, especially as regards the use of discourse
connectives.
By introducing a formal scheme for representing document structure, we have
been able to define the task of document structuring in a simple and clear way. Fol-
lowing Scott and Souza (1990) and many other researchers on NLG, it is assumed
that the rhetorical input takes the form of an RST tree; the output is a tree rep-
resenting high-level linguistic structure, each node being labeled with a document
structure category defined by the features level and indentation. Our scheme is by
no means complete (e.g., it has no treatment of tables, or figures, or text presented
in boxes); however, it is sufficient to generate hundreds of alternative solutions even
for a rhetorical structure containing only four or five elementary propositions. By
clarifying the task of document structuring in this way, we have been able to de-
fine it as a constraint satisfaction problem and thus to implement a system in which
the relevant constraints are defined declaratively; this means that constraints can be
added or removed without changing the rest of the program. Such a system is use-
ful not only as a module in an NLG architecture, but also as a tool for theoretical
investigation: the results of any proposed combination of constraints can be quickly
tested.

Power, Scott, and Bouayad-Agha Document Structure
In pursuing this investigation, our methodology has been essentially the same as
Nunberg?s, relying largely on intuition as a means of separating the wheat from the
chaff. Moreover, by implementing the theory in a system that can enumerate solutions
systematically, we are able to test more thoroughly any proposed rule or constraint, at
least for simple examples. This methodology assumes, first, that intuition is a reliable
guide, and second, that constraints derived from small examples will apply also to
full-scale examples. In the initial stages of an investigation, these assumptions seem
reasonably safe. Many of the solutions generated by the program are so obviously
good or bad that there is no point in submitting them to the judgment of literary
experts or subjecting them to some other kind of empirical test. No doubt large-scale
examples will require additional constraints, but much can still be learned from simple
ones: an intrinsically bad paragraph will usually remain bad when placed into a larger
context.
As a contrast, it is interesting to consider the investigation into layout by Bateman
et al (2001). Their approach could not be more different from ours. Instead of sim-
ple examples, they analyze (and regenerate) an exceedingly complicated page from a
magazine. This page, which describes the game of hockey, includes several drawings,
a photograph, diagrams of the pitch, boxes of text, two headers, and a glossary, all laid
out in five different grids, each having a different division into columns. Their RST
analysis of this page is correspondingly complex, with 45 elementary propositions
and the same number of rhetorical relationships (the whole RST tree therefore has
nearly 100 nodes). To analyze such an example informally may be a useful source of
insights, but to attempt a complete formal analysis (and generation) of the page seems
bold in the extreme. However, despite this difference in approach, the framework
that emerges from Bateman et al?s work is broadly similar to ours. First, a distinc-
tion is made between ?layout structure? and ?physical layout? (Bateman et al 2001,
section 3.1); although the discussion concerns boxes in a grid rather than more con-
ventional linguistic units like section and paragraph, this distinction reflects the need
for an abstract level of representation that can be related more easily to the rhetor-
ical structure of the message. Secondly, in sections 4 and 5 of their article, Bateman
et al distinguish clearly between layout structure and rhetorical structure, pointing
out that the two are not necessarily isomorphic and that constraints on the mapping
must therefore be considered:
Mapping is generally achieved by placing parts of the RST-structure
in correspondence with particular nodes in layout structure. [. . .] As
we have now seen, however, this correspondence is complicated by
the fact that the layout structure and the RST tree need not remain
congruent.
(Bateman et al 2001, page 430)
However, Bateman and his colleagues do not provide a detailed account of the forma-
tion rules for layout structure, or of the constraints on the mapping between the RST
tree and the layout structure. We are unsure, for example, whether ?layout structure?
would include such patterns as sections, paragraphs, and bulleted lists. Nevertheless,
the role played by these two abstract representations seems similar?they mediate be-
tween rhetorical structure and physical layout?so there is some reason to think that
the two approaches are yielding results that are compatible.
Both in the Bateman et al study and in our own work, a problem arises as to how
the proposed representations and constraints should be validated. Our own approach,
at least provisionally, has been that the theory should be embodied in a program
248
Computational Linguistics Volume 29, Number 2
that can generate many alternative solutions and rank them using some kind of cost
function; at this point, we rely on intuition to judge whether the system has generated
a plausible set of solutions and ranked them in an appropriate order. For the very
complex examples considered by Bateman et al, the set of solutions could only be
sampled: Even keeping the wording of individual propositions constant, they would
number billions. Evaluation in this field has to take account of style as well as quality;
in other words, it has a subjective side as well as an objective one. The problem
is not just to generate a good solution, but to generate one that satisfies a set of
subjective preferences, so that, for example, different documents produced for the
same company will exhibit the desired consistency of style. Eventually, some kind
of empirical investigation will be needed (e.g., an expert evaluation, or a study of
the impression made on the intended readers). At the present state of knowledge,
however, such refinements seem exaggerated: If we can separate the satisfactory from
the barbaric, we will be more than content.
