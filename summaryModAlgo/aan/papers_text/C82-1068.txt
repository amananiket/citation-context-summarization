INTRODUCTION 
T e s t - s c o r e  semantics represents a break w i t h  the t r a d i t i o n a l  approaches to seman- 
t i c s  in t h a t  i t  is based on the premise t h a t  almost e v e r y t h i n g  t h a t  r e l a t e s  to 
n a t u r a l  languages i s  a m a t t e r  o f  degree. The acceptance o f  t h i s  premise e n t a i l s  
an abandonment of b i v a l e n t  l o g i c a l  systems as a basis f o r  the a n a l y s i s  of n a t u r a l  
languages and suggests the adoption o f  f u z z y  l o g i c  (Zadeh (1975), Bellman and 
Zadeh (1977), Zadeh (1979)) as the basic conceptual framework f o r  d e a l i n g  w i t h  
n a t u r a l  languages. 
In f u z z y  l o g i c ,  as in n a t u r a l  languages, almost e v e r y t h i n g  is a m a t t e r  of degree. 
To put i t  m e t a p h o r i c a l l y ,  the use of fuzTy l o g i c  may be l i k e n e d  t o  w r i t i n g  w i t h

a d j u s t a b l e  o r i f i c e ,  so t h a t  one may w r i t e ,  i f  need be, as f i n e l y  as w i t h  a b a l l -  
p o i n t  pen. Thus, a commitment to fuzzy l o g i c  does not preclude the use o f  a b i v a -  
l e n t  l o g i c  when i t  i s  a p p r o p r i a t e  to do so. In e f f e c t ,  such a con~itment merely

(Montague (1974), Partee (1976) and a t t r i b u t e d  grammars f o r  programming languages 
(Knuth (1968)), plays a much l e s s e r  r o l e  i n  t e s t - s c o r e  semantics-a r o l e  represented

TEST-SCORE SEMANTICS FOR NATURAL LANGUAGES 421 
bility theory and fuzzy logic provide a more appropriate framework for dealing with 
natural languages than the traditional logical systems in which there are no gra- 
dations for truth, membership and belief, and no tools for coming to grips with 
vagueness, fuzziness and randomness. 
In what follows, we shall sketch some of the main ideas underlying test-score seman- 
tics and illustrate them with simple examples. A more detailed exposition and ad- 
ditional examples may be found in Zadeh (1981). 
BASIC ASPECTS OF TEST-SCORE SEMANTICS 
As was stated earlier, the point of departure in test-score semantics is the assump- 
tion that any semantic entity may be represented as a system of elastic constraints 
on a collection of objects or derived objects in a universe of discourse. 
Assuming that each object may be characterized by one or more fuzzy relations, the 
collection of objects in a universe of discourse may be identified with a collection 
of relations which constitute a fuzzv relational database or. equivalently, a state 
description (Carnap (1952)). In this database, then, a derived'object would be char- 
acterized by one or more fuzzy relations which are derived from other relations in 
the database by operations expressed in an appropriate relation-manipulating lan- 
guage. 
In more concrete terms, let SE denote a semantic entity, e.g., the proposition 
p 4 During much of the past decade Pat earned far more than 
all of his close friends put together, 
whose meaning we wish to represent. To this end, we must (a) identify the con- 
straints which are implicit or explicit in SE; (b) describe the tests which must 
be performed to ascertain the degree to which each constraint is satisfied; and 
(c) specify the manner in which the degrees in question or, equivalently, the par- 
tial test scores are to be aggregated to yield an overall test score. In general, 
the overall test score would be represented as a vector whose components are num- 
bers in the unit interval or, more generally, possibility/probability distributions 
over this interval. 
Spelled out in greater detail, the process of meaning-representation in test-score 
semantics involves three distinct phases. In Phase 1, an explanatory database 
frame or EDF, for short, is constructed. EDF consists of a collection of rela- 
tional frames each of which specifies the name of a relation, the names of its at- 
tributes and their respective domains,with the understanding that the meaning of 
each relation in EDF is known to the addressee of the meaning-representation pro- 
cess. Thus, the choice of EDF is not unique and is strongly influenced by the de- 
sideratum of explanatory effectiveness as well as by the assumption made regarding 
the knowledge profile of the addressee of the meaning-representation process. For 
example, in the case of the proposition p 4 During much of the past decade Pat --- -- 
earned far more than all of his close friends put together, the EDF might consist ---7----- ----- of the relational frames 
FRIEND [Namel; Name2; p], where p is the degree.to which Name1 is a friend of 
Name2; INCOME [Name; Income; Year], where Income is the income of Name in year 
Year, counting backward from the present; MUCH [Proportion; ~1, where in is the de- 
gree to which a numerical value of Proportion fits the meaning of much in the con- 
text of p; and FAR.MORE [Numberl; Number2; P]. in which p is the degree to which 
Number1 fits the description far more in relation to NumberP. In effect, the com- 
position of EDF is determined by the information that is needed for an assessment 
of the compatibility of the given SE with any designated object or, more generally, 
a specified state of affairs in the universe of discourse. 
In Phase 2, a test procedure is constructed which upon application to an explan- 
atory database -that is, an instantiation of EDF - yields the test scores, 
428 L.A. ZADEH 
Tl,... 
bv the 
3Tn, which represent the degrees to which the elastic constraints induced 
constituents of SE are satisfied. For example, in the case of p', the test 
ppocedure would yield the test scores for the constraints induced by close friend, 
@, far more, etc. -- 
In Phase 3, the partial test scores obtained in Phase 2 are aggregated into an 
overall test score, T, which serves as a measure of the compatibility of SE with 
ED, the explanatory database. As was stated earlier, the components of T are num- 
bers in the unit interval or, more generally, possibility/probability distributions 
over this interval. In particular, when the semantic entity is a proposition, p, 
and the overall test score, T, is a scalar, 'I may be interpreted as the truth of 
p relative to ED or, equivalently, as the possibility of ED given p. In this in- 
terpretation, then, the classical truth-conditional semantics may be viewed as a 
special case of test-score semantics which results when the constraints induced 
by p are inelastic and the overall test score is allowed to be only pass or fail -- 
The test procedure which yields the overall test score T is interpreted as the 
meaning of SE. 
To illustrate the phases in question, we shall consider a few simple examples 
(a) SE 4 Ellen resides in a'small city near Oslo. 
In this case, EDF is assumed to comprise the following relational 
frames ( + stands for union ): 
EDF 4 RESIDENCE [Name; City.Name]+ 
POPULATION [City.Name; Population]+ 
SMALL [Population; PI+ 
NEAR [City.Namel; City.Name2; lo] 
In RESIDENCE, City.Name is the name of the city in which Name resides; in POPULA- 
TION, Population is the number of residents in City.Name; in SMALL, P is the de- 
gree to which a city with a population equal to the value of Population is small; 
and in NEAR, P is the degree to which City.Namel is near City.NameZ. 
The test procedure which leads to the overall test score T -- and thus represents 
the meaning of SE - is described below. In this procedure, Steps 1 and 2 involve 
the determination of the value of an attribute given the values of other attri- 
butes; Steps 3 and 4 involve the testing of constraints; and Step 5 involves an 
aggregation of the partial test scores into the overall test score T. 
1. Find the name of the residence of Ellen: 
RE! c,ty RameRESIDENCEIName=Ellen] 
which means that the value of Name is set to Ellen and the value of City.Name is 
read, yielding RE, the residence of Ellen. 
2. Find the population of the residence of Ellen: 
n 
PRE = Population PDPULATION[City.Name=RE] 
3. Test the constraint induced by SMALL: 
r,guSMALLIPopulation=RE] 
where ~~ denotes the resulting test score. 
4. Test the constraint induced by NEAR: 
T2=uNEAR[City.Name=Oslo; City.Name2=RE] 
5. Aggregate ~~ and T2: 
T = T1 ,. T2 
where A stands for min in infix position, and T is the overall test score. This 
'TEST-SCORESEMANTICSFORNATURALLANGUAGES 429 
mode of aggregation implies that, in SE, the denotation of conjunction is taken to 
be the Cartesian product of the denotations of the conjuncts (Zadeh (1981)). 
(b) SEA During much of the past decade Pat earned far more than all of 
his close friends put together. 
In this case, we shall employ the EDF described earlier, that is: 
EDF 2 INCOME[Name; Year; Amount]+ 
FRIEND[Namel; Name2; u]+ 
FAR.MORE[Numberl; NumberP; n]+ 
MUCH[Proportion; u] 
The test procedure comprises the following steps: 
1. Find the fuzzy set of Pat's friends: 
FP4 NamelxnFRIEND [Name2 = Pat] 
in which the left subscript Namelxu signifies that the relation FRIEND [NameP=Pat] 
is projected on the domain of the attributes Name1 and u, yielding the fuzzy set of 
friends of Pat. 
2. Intensify FP to account for the modifier.*: 
CFP 4 FP2 
in which FP* denotes the fuzzy set which results from squaring the grade of member- 
ship of each component of FP. The assumption underlying this step is that the 
fuzzy set of close friends of Pat may be derived from that of friends of Pat by in- 
tensification. 
3. Find the fuzzy multiset of incomes of close friends of Pat in year 
Year; , i=l,...,lO: 
ICFP. 4 , AmountINCOMEIName = CFP; Year=Yeari] 
In stipulating that the right-hand member be treated as a fuzzy multiset, we imply 
that the identical elements should not be combined, as they would be in the case of 
a fuzzy set. With this understanding, ICFPi will be of the general form 
ICFPi = 6,/e1+6,/e+...+6,/em . 
where el,..., e m are the incomes of Name ..., Name 1' m, 
respectively, in Year., andsl,...,,m 6 are the grades of membership of Name,;.-, 
Namem in the fuzzy se t of close friends of Pat. 
4. Find the total income of close friends of Pat in Yeari , i=l;.., 10: 
TICFPi =6,el+...+ 6 e mm 
which represents a weighted arithmetic 
in Yeari. 
5. Find Pat's income in Yeari: 
IPi 4AmountINCOME[Name=Pat; 
6. Test the constraint induced 
sum of the incomes of close friends of Pat 
Year=Yeari].

7. Find the sigma-count (Zadeh (1981)) of years during which Pat's income 
was far.greater than the total income of all of his close friends:
