Abstract 
In this paper, we report a survey of lan-
guage resources in Indonesia, primarily of 
indigenous languages. We look at the offi-
cial Indonesian language (Bahasa Indone-
sia) and 726 regional languages of Indone-
sia (Bahasa Nusantara) and list all the 
available LRs that we can gathered. This 
paper suggests that the smaller regional 
languages may remain relatively unstudied, 
and unknown, but they are still worthy of 
our attention. Various LRs of these endan-
gered languages are being built and col-
lected by regional language centers for 
study and its preservation. We will also 
briefly report its presence on the Internet. 
 
1 Introduction 
It is not hard to get a picture of just how linguisti-
cally diverse Indonesia is. There are 726 languages 
in the country; making it the world?s second most 
diverse, after Papua New Guinea which has 823 
local languages (Mart? et al, 2005:48). 
The languages of Indonesia are part of a com-
plex linguistic situation that is generally seen as 
comprised of three categories: Indonesian lan-
guage, the regional indigenous languages, and for-
eign languages. (Alwi and Sugono, 2000).   
The indigenous languages of Indonesia - also re-
ferred to as vernaculars or provincial languages, 
collectively called as Bahasa Nusantara - exhibits 
great variation in numbers of speakers. Thirteen of 
them have a million or more speakers, accounting 
for 69.91% of the total population ? Javanese 
(75,200,000 speakers), Sundanese (27,000,000), 
Malay (20,000,000), Madurese (13,694,000), Mi-
nangkabau (6,500,000), Batak (5,150,000), Bugis-
nese (4,000,000), Balinese (3,800,000), Acehnese 
(3,000,000), Sasak (2,100,000), Makasarese 
(1,600,000), Lampungese (1,500,000), and Rejang 
(1,000,000). (Lauder, 2004: 3-4). Of these 13 lan-
guages, only 7 languages have presence on the 
Internet (Riza 2006).  
The remaining 713 languages have a total popu-
lation of only 41.4 million speakers, and the major-
ity of these have very small numbers of speakers. 
For example, 386 languages are spoken by 5,000 
or less; 233 have 1,000 speakers or less; 169 lan-
guages have 500 speakers or less; and 52 have 100 
or less (Gordon, 2005). These languages are facing 
various degrees of language endangerment (Crys-
tal, 2000). 
There is evidence from census data over three 
decades that the growth in the numbers of speakers 
of Indonesian is reducing the numbers of speakers 
of the indigenous languages (Lauder, 2005). Con-
cerns that this kind of growth would give Indone-
sian the potential to replace the regional languages 
were aired as early as the 1980s. (Poedjosoedarmo, 
1981; Alisjahbana, 1984).  
 
2 Language Resources 
Many language centers in Indonesia have em-
barked in various research and development in 
creation of language resources (LRs). Unfortu-
nately, this development mainly only focused on 
creating LRs for the official language Bahasa In-
donesia. In the followings, we describe the present

and ongoing LRs research projects with emphasis 
on the indigenous languages. 
2.1 Indonesian Electronic Dictionary System 
(KEBI) 
Our laboratory has worked to enlarge and improve 
the quality of Indonesian electronic dictionaries. 
Starting 1987, it took us at least 4 years to develop 
all necessary components for CICC-MMTS, result-
ing with many first-ever Indonesian language re-
sources, primarily electronic dictionaries and 
grammar rules for language analysis and genera-
tion. This extension have resulted in a collection of 
500,000 word entries and more than 2 million 
derivational and inflected words. As part of this 
research, we built an online access to the dictionar-
ies (http://nlp.inn.bppt.go.id/kebi) enabling users to 
add new words and definition. KBBI electronic 
dictionary is scheduled to be launched in 2008, 
during 100 years celebration of the official Bahasa 
Indonesia. 
2.2 BPPT-ANTARA Corpus 
This parallel corpus was developed as extension to 
Indonesia National Corpus Initiative (INCI) which 
was earlier created to support the development of a 
hybrid stochastic-symbolic system BIAS-II. Cur-
rently, a pure statistical MT system based on Phar-
aoh is developed by BPPT and National News 
Agency (ANTARA) using 500K sentences pair, 
expected to have better accuracy and robustness 
and could enhance the quality of translation (cur-
rent BLEU score 0.72).  
2.3 Regional Languages Mapping (National 
Language Center) 
For the past 15 years, the Indonesia National Lan-
guage Center have been collecting information re-
garding all indigenous languages. By the end of 
this year, this project will be completed and all re-
sult and findings will be open to public. 
2.4 Dictionaries of  Bahasa Nusantara, Indo-
nesian Linguistics Association (MLI)  
Masyarakat Linguistik Indonesia (MLI) is a group 
of institutions, organizations and corporation, 
working together on mutually defined goals and 
projects that seek to provide a specification of  LRs 
of all languages of Indonesia. MLI also help mem-
bers to use the specification for tools and applica-
tions; find the best means to disseminate the speci-
fications, tools and applications and  encourage an 
open standard-based approach to the creation and 
interchange of LRs. It also demonstrate how MLI 
can be applied to Asian Language Resource (ALR) 
through making the results of collaborative en-
deavors available throughout the members of  the 
group and wider associations; provide training, 
awareness and educational events and share with 
each other their work on related issues.  
2.5 Speech Corpus 
In a mission to improve the quality of automatic 
speech recognition (ASR), a collaboration of 
Telkom RDC and ATR-Japan has constructed 
speakers? corpus (40 speakers, 2000 sentences) 
which is expected to improve the accuracy of ASR 
to 90% level.  
2.6 Other Corpus 
Other monolingual corpus is found online. The 
major news articles corpora on the web is Tem-
pointerakif.com (56,471 articles). Kompas corpus 
(71,109 articles) can be found at 
http://ilps.science.uva.nl/Resources/BI.
