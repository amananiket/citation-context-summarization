ABSTRACT 
In cooperative man-machine interaction, it is necessary but not sufficient for a system to respond 
truthfully and informatively to a user's question. In particular, if the system has reason to believe that its 
planned response might mislead the user, then it must block that conclusion by modifying its response. 
This paper focusses on identifying and avoiding potentially misleading responses by acknowledging types 
of "informing behavior" usually expected of an expert. We attempt o give a formal account of several 
-types of assertions that should be included in response to questions concerning the achievement of some 
goal (in addition to the simple answer), lest the questioner otherwise be misled. 
1. Introduction\] 
In cooperative man-machine interaction, it is necessary but not sufficient for a system to respond 
truthfully and informatively to a user's question. In particular, if the system has reason to believe that its 
planned response might mislead the user to draw a false conclusion, then it must block that conclusion by 
modifying or adding to its response. 
Such cooperative behavior was investigated in \[5\], in which a modification of Grice% Mazim of Quality 
- "Be truthful" - is proposed: 
If you, the speaker, plan to say anything which may imply for the hearer something that you 
believe to be false, then provide further information to block it. 
This behavior was studied in the context of interpreting certain definite noun phrases. In this paper, we 
investigate this revised principle as applied to responding to users' plan-related questions. Our overall aim 
is to: 
1. characterize tractable cases in which the system as respondent (R) can anticipate the 
possibility of the user/questioner (Q) drawing false conclusions from its response and hence 
alter it so as to prevent his happening; 
2. develop a formal method for computing the projected inferences that Q may draw from a

particular response, identifying those factors whose presence or absence catalyzes the 
inferences; 
3. enable the .system to generate modifications of its response that can defuse possible false 
inferences and that may provide additional useful information as well. 
In responding to any question, including those related to plans, a respondent (R) must conform to 
Grice's first Maxim of Quantitlt as well as the revised Maxim of Quality stated above: 
Make your contribution as informative as is required (for the current purposes of the 
exchange). 
At best, if R's response is not so informative, it may be seen as uncooperative. At worst, it may end up 
violating the revised Maxim of Quality, causing Q to conclude something R either believes to be false or 
does not know to be true: the consequences could be dreadful. Our task is to characterize more precisely 
what this expected informativeness consists of. la question answering, there seem to be several quite 
different types of information, over and beyond the simple answer to a question, that are nevertheless 
expected. For example, 
1. When a task-related question is posed to an expert {R), R is expected to provide additional 
information that he recognizes as necessary to the performance of the task, of which the 
qt:estioner (Q) may be unaware. Such response behavior was discussed and implemented by 
Alien \[1\] in a system to simulate a train information booth attendant responding to requests 
for schedule and track information. In this case, not providing the expected additional 
information is simply uncooperative: Q won't conclude the train doesn't depart at any time if 
?~ fails to volunteer one. 
: ~=~ i :~ respect o discussions a ld /or  arguments, a speaker contradicting another is expected to 
supp~'~ his contrary contention. Again, failing to provide support would simply be viewed as 
u.~c~,o~erative \[2, 3\]. 
. With respect o an expert's responses to questions, if Q expects that R would inform him of P 
!f P were true, then Q may interpre t R's silence regarding P as implying P is not true. s Thus if 
I:~ k.qows P to be true, his silence may lead to Q's being misled. This third type of expected 
informativeness i  the basis for the potentially misleading responses that we are trying to 
avoid a.~d that constitute the subject of this paper. 
What is of interest o us is characterizing the Ps that Q would expect an expert R to inform him of, if 
they hold. Notice that these Ps differ from script-based expectations \[8\], which are based on what is 
taken to be the ordinary course of events in a situation. In describing such a situation, if the speaker 
d,,esn't explicitly reference some element P of the script, the listener simply assumes it is true. On the 
other hand, the Ps of interest here are based on normal cooperative discourse behavior, as set out in 
Grice's maxims. If the speaker doesn't make explicit some information P that the listener believes he 
would possess and inform the listener of, the listener assumes it is false. 
In this paper, we attempt to give a formal account of a subclass of Ps that should be included (in 
addition to the simple answer) in response to questions involving Q's achieving some goal 4 - e.g., ? Can I 
3This is an interactional version of what Reiter \[IS l has called the "Closed World Assumption" and what McCarthy \[O\] has 
discussed in the context of "Circumscription'. 
4A companion paper \[6 ! discusses responses which may mislead Q into assuming some default which R knows not to hold. 
Related work \[4\] discusses providing indirect or  modified responsel to yes/no questions where a direct response, while 
truthful, might mislead Q.

drop CIS5777", "I want to euroi in CIS5777", 'How do I get to/ViarGh Creek on the Exl~ressway?', etc., 
lest that rzsponse otherwise mislead Q. In this endeavor, our first step is to specify that knowledge that an 
expert R must have in order to identify the Ps that Q would expect o be informed of, in response to his 
question. Our second step is to formalize that knowledge and show how the system can use it. Our third 
step is to show how the system can modify its planned response so as to convey those Ps. In this paper, 
Section 2 addresses the first step of this process and Sections 3 and 4 address the second. The third step 
we mention here only in passing. 
2. Factors in Computing Likely Informing Behavior\] 
Before discussing the factors involved in computing this desired system behavior, we want to call 
attention to the distinction we are drawing between actions and events, and between the stated goal of a 
question and its intended goal. We limit the term action to things that Q has some control over. Things 
beyond Q's control we will call events, even if performed by other agents. While events may be likel3/or 
even necessary,, Q and R nevertheless can do nothing more than wait for ~hem to happen. This distinction 
between ~ctions and events shows up in R's response behavior: if an action is needed, R can suggest hat 
Q perform it. If an event is, R can do no more than inform Q. 
Our second distinction is between the stated goal or "S-goal = of a request and its intended goal or 
=I-goal =. The former is the goal most directly associated with Q's request, beyond that Q know the 
information. That is, we take the S-goal of a request to be the goal directly achieved by using the 
information. 
Underlying the stated goal of a request hough may be another goal that the speaker wants to achieve. 
This intended goal or ?l-go3!" may be related to the S-goal of the request in any of a number of ways: 
? The l-goal may be the same as the S-goal. 
? The l-goal may be more abstract than the S-goal, which addresses only part of the I-goal. 
(This is the standard goal/sub-goal relation found in hierarchical planning \[14\].) For example, 
Q's S-goal may be to delete some files (e.g., *How can I delete all but the last version of 
FOO.MSS??), while his l-goal may be to bring his file usage under quota. This more abstract 
goal may also involve archiving some other files, moving some into another person's directory, 
etc. 
* The S-goai may be an enablinK condition for the I-goal. For example, Q's S-goal may be to get 
read/write access to a file, while his I-goal may be to alter it. 
The l-goal may be more ~eneral than the S-goal. For example, Q's S-goal may be to know how 
to repeat a control-N, while his l-goal may be to know how to effect multiple sequential 
instances of a control character. 
Conversely, the l-goal may be more specific than the S-goal - for example, Q's S-goal may be 
to know how to send files to someone on another machine, while his I-goal is just to send a 
particular file to a local network user, which may allow for a specialized procedure. 
Inferring the l-goal corresponding to an S-goal is an active area.of research \[1, Carberry83, 10, 11\]. We 
assume for the purposes of this paper that R can successfuUy do so. One problem is that the relationship 
that Q believes to hold between his S-goal and his I-goal may not actually hold: for example, the S-goal 
181 
may not fulfill part of the bgoal, or it may not instantiate it, or it may not be a pre-condition for it. In 
fact, the S-goal may not even be possible to effect! This failure, under the rubric "relaxing the 
appropriate-query assumption' ,  is discussed in more detail in \[10, nl. It is also reason for augmenting R's 
response with appropriate Ps, as we note informally in this section and more formally in the next. 
Having drawn these distinctions, we now claim that in order for the system to compute both a direct 
answer to Q's request and such Ps as he would expect to be informed of, were they true, the system must 
be able to draw upon knowledge/beliefs about 
? the events or actions, if any, that can bring about a goal 
? their enabling conditions 
? the likelihood of an event occuring or the enabling conditions for an action holding, with 
respect o a state 
? ways of evaluating methods of achieving goals - for example, with respect o simplicity, other 
consequences ( ide effects), likelihood of success, etc. 
? general characteristics of cooperative xpert behavior 
The roles played by these different types of knowledge (as well as specific examples of them) are well 
illustrated in the next section. 
3. Formalizing Knowledge for Expert Response 
In this section we give examples of how a formal model of user beliefs about cooperative xpert behavior 
can be used to avoid misleading responses to task-related questions - in particular, what is a very 
representative s t of questions, those of the form =How do I do X? =. Although we use logic for the model 
because it is clear and precise, we are not proposing theorem proving as the means of computing 
cooperative behavior. In Section 4 we suggest a computational mechanism. The examples are from a 
domain of advising students and involve responding to the request ?I want to drop CIS577". The set of 
individuals includes not only 
change states, we represent 
corresponding to events or 
convenient: 
q 
R 
Sc 
RB(P) 
RBQB(P) 
admissible(4S)) 
likely(a,S) 
holds(P,S) 
want(x,P) 
students, instructors, courses, etc. but also states. Since events and actions 
hem as (possibly parameterized) functions from states to states. All terms 
actions will be underlined. For these examples, the following notation is 
the  user 
the expert 
the current state of the student 
R believes proposition P
R believes that Q believes P
event/action e can apply in state S 
a is a likely event/action in state S 
P, a proposition, is true in S 
x wants P to be true 
To encode the preconditions and consequences of performing 2n action, we adopt an axiomatization of 
STRIPS operators due to \[Chester83, 7 15\]. The preconditions on an action being applicable are encoded 
using "holds" and "admissible" (essentially defining "admissible'). Namely, if cl ..... ca are precondltions 
on an action a, 
182 
holds(cl,s) &...~ holds(ca,s) =~ admissible(a(s)) 
a's immediate consequences pl ..... pm can be ~tated as 
admissible(a(s)) =, holds(pl, a(s)) a ... & holds(pm, a(s)) 
A frame axiom states that only pl ..... pm have changed. 
-~(p=pl) ~ ... ~ ~(p fpm)  & holds(p,s)3 ,% admissible(a(s)) t hoids,a(s)) 
In particular, we can state the preconditions and consequences of dropping CIS577. (h acd n are 
variables, while C stands for CIS577.) 
RB(holds(enrolled(h, C, fall), n) & holds(date(n)<Novl6, n) 
admissible( drop (h, CX . ) ) ) 
RB( admissible( drop(h, CX n ) ) =~ holds(-~enrolled( h,C,fall),drop(h, CX n ) ) ) 
RBl-(p=enrolled(h,C,fall)) admissible(drop(h,C)(n)) holds(p,.) 
holds(p,drop(h,C)(n))) 
Of course, this only partially solves the frame problem, since there will be implications of pl ..... pm in 
general. For instance, it is likely that one might have an axiom stating that one receives a grade in a 
course only if the individual is enrolled in the course. 
Q's S-goal in dropping CIS577 is not being in the course. By a process of reasoning discussed in \[10, 11\], 
R may conclude that Q's likely intended goal (l-goal) is not failing it. That is, R may believe: 
RBQB(holds(-ffaii(Q,C), drop(Q,C~(Sc)))5 
RB(want(Q,-4aii(Q,C))  
What we claim is: (1) R must give a truthful response addressing at least Q's S-goal; (2) in addition, R 
may have to provide information in order not to mislead Q; and (3) R may give additional information to 
be cooperative in other ways. In the subsections below, we enumerate the cases that R must check in 
effecting (2). In each case, we give both a formal representation of the additional information to be 
conveyed and a possible English gloss. In that gloss, the part addressing Q's S-goal wiil appear in normal 
type, while the additional information will be underlined. 
For each case, we give two formulae: a statement of R's beliefs about the current situation and an 
axiom stating R's beliefs about Q's expectations. Formulae of the first type have the form RB(P). 
Formulae of the second type relate such beliefs to performing an informing action. They involve a 
statement of the form 
~lP l  =~ likely(i, Se), 
where i is an informing act. For example, if R believes there is a better way to achieve Q's goal, R is 
likely to inform Q of that better way. Since it is assumed that Q has this belief, we have 
QB( RB\[P\] = likely(i, Sc)). 
Sit will also be the ease that RBQB(admlssible(drop(Q,C~S?))) if Q's asks "How can ! drop CIS5777", but not if he asks 
"Can i drop CIS577f'. in the latter e ra ,  Q must of course believe that it may be admissible, or why ask the question. !a 
either ease, R's subsequent behavior dot~a't seem contingent on hil beliefs ab '~ '~ beliefs about admissibility. 
183 
where we can equate ?Q believes i is likely" with "Q expects i." Since R has no direct access to Q's 
beliefs, this must be embedded in R's model of Q's belief space. Therefore, the axioms have the form 
(modulo quantifier placement) 
RBQB( RB\[P l =, likely{i, So) ). 
An informing act is meant to serve as a command to a natural language generator which selects 
appropriate i xical items, phrasing, etc. for a natural anguage utterance. Such an act has the form 
inform-that(R,Q,P) R informs Q that P istrue. 
3.1. Fa i lu re  o f  enabl ing eondli~lona 
Suppose that it is past the November 15th deadline or that the official records don't show Q enrolled in 
CIS577. Then the enabling conditions for dropping it are not met. That is, R believes Q's S-goal cannot be 
achieved from So. 
\[1\] RB(want(Q,-ffail(Q,C)) & -,admissible(drop(Q,C~Sc))) 
Thus R initially plans to answer "You can't drop CIS577". Beyond this, there are two possibilities. 
3.1.1. A way 
If R knows another action b that would achieve Q's goals (cf. formula \[2\]), Q would expect to be 
informed about it. If not so informed, Q may mistakenly conclude that there is no other way. Formula 
\[3\] states this belief that R has about Q's expectations. 
I21 RB((3b)\[admissible(b(Sc)) & holds(-,fail(Q,C), b(Sc))i) 
\[31 RBQB(RBIwant(Q,-faiI(Q,C)) & -,admissible(drop(Q(C\](Sc)) i & 
nB\[(3b)\[admissible(b(Se)) ~ holds(--faii(Q,C),6(~c))l\] 
=* likely(inform-that(R, Q
(fib) \[admis~ibh:(b(Sc)) e; hold~Ofail(Q,C),b(Sc)) 
can(Q,b)),Sc)\]) 
R's full response is therefore "You can't drop 577; you can b." For instance, bcould be changing status to 
auditor, which may be performed until December I. 
3.1.2. No way 
If R doesn't know of any action or event that could achieve Q's goal (cf. \[4\]), Q would expect to be so 
informed. Formula \[5\] states this belief about Q's expectations. 
\[4\] RB(-,(3a)Iadmissible(a(Sc)) & holds(-,fail(q,C),a(Sc))l) 
\[5\] RBqB(RB(want(q,--fail(q,c)) & -,(3a)\[admissibleia(S?)) 
" ~ holdsl--ffail(q,c), a(Sc))\]) 
=~ likely(inform-that(R, Q -(3a )\[admissible(a(Se)) 
8 hol~('.$ait(Q.C),a(Sc)}\]),Se)) 
To say only that Q cannot drop the course does not exhibit expert cooperative behavior, since Q would be 
uncertain as to whether R had considered other alternatives. Therefore, R's full response is "You can't 
drop 577; there isn ~ anything you can do to prevent failing.= 
Notice that R's analysis of the situation may turn up additional information which a cooperative xpert 
184 
could provide that does not involve avoiding misleading Q. For instance, R could indicate enabling 
conditions that prevent here being a solution: suppose the request o drop the course is made after the 
November 15th deadline. Then R would believe the following, in addition to \[1\] 
RB(holds(enrolled(Q,C,fall),Sc)/~ hold6(date(Sc)>Nov15,Sc D 
More generally, we need a schema such as the following about Q's beliefs: 
RBQB(RB\[want(Q,'~fail(Q,C D 
& (holds(Pl, S) &...& hoids(Pn, S) =~ admissible(a(S))) 
& (-~tholds(Pi, S), for some Pi above)\] 
=~ iik ely ( in f orm-t hat (R, Q,-,hol ds(Pi, S )),S ) ) 
In this ease the response should be "'You can't drop 577; Pi isn~ true." Alternatively, the language 
generator might paraphrase the whole response as, "if Pi were true, you could drop." 
Of course there are potentially many ways to try to achieve a goal: by a single action, by a single 
event, or by an event and an action ....  In fact, the search for a sequence of events or actions that would 
achieve the goal may consider many alternatives. If all fail, it is far from obvious which blocked condition 
to notify Q of, and knowledge is needed to guide the choice. Some heuristics for dealing with that problem 
~ .. given in \[12\]. 
3.2. An nonproduct ive  act 
Suppose the proposed action does not achieve Q's l-goal, cL \[6\]. For example, dropping the course may 
still mean that failing status would be recorded as a WF (withdrawal while failing). R may initially plan to 
answer "You can drop 577 by ...'. However, Q would expect o be told that his proposed action does not 
achieve his l-goal. Formula \[7\] states R's belief about this expectation. 
\[6\] RB(-holds(-fail(Q,C), drop(Q,C\](Sc)) & admissible(drop(Q,C}(Sc)) ) 
\[7\] RBQB(RB\[ want(Q,-,fail(Q,c)) & -,holds(-fail(Q,C),drop(Q,C\](Sc)) 
I~ admissible( drop (Q, C\]( Sc ) )\] 
likely( in f orm-t h at (Fl, Q , 
-hold~(-/ail(Q,C),drop(Q,C)(Sc))),Sc)) 
R's full response is, "You can drop 577 by .... However, you will still fail." Furthermore, given the 
reasoning in section 3.1.1 above, R's full response would also inform Q if there is an action b that the user 
can take instead. 
3.3 .  A bet ter  way  
Suppose R believes that  there is a better way to achieve Q's 1-goal, cf. \[8\] - for example, taking an 
incomplete to have additional time to perform the work, and thereby not losing all the effort Q has 
already expended. Q would expect that R, as a cooperative xpert, would inform him of such a better 
way, ef. \[9 I. If R doesn't, R risks misleading Q that there isn't one. 
\[8\] RB((3b)\[holds(-fail(Q,C), b(Sc}) & 
admissible(b(Sc)) & better(b,drop(Q,C)(Sc\])\]) 
I91 RBQB(RB\[want(Q,-4ail(Q,C))\] ,~ 
RB\[(3b)\[holds(-~fail(Q,C), b(Sc)) & admissible(b(Sc)) 
better(b,drop(Q,C)(Sc)) 
=* like ly ( i n form -t h a t (R, Q , 
185 
(3b )\[holda(-., f ail(Q,C),b(Sc)) ~Y admissible(b(Se)) 
better(b, drop(Q,C)(Sc))l\], Se)\]) 
R's direct response is to indicate how f can be done. R's full response includes, in addition, "b is a better 
way.  ~ 
Notice that if R doesn't explicitly tell Q that he is presenting a better way (i.e., he just presents the 
method), Q may be misled that the response addresses his S-goal: i.e., he may falsely conclude that he is 
being told how to drop the course. (The possibility shows up clearer in other examples - e.g., if R omits 
the first sentence of the response below 
Q: How do I get to Marsh Creek on the Expressway? 
R: It's faster and shorter to take Route 30. Go out 
Lancaster Ave until .... 
Thus even when adhering to expert response behavior in terms of addressing an I-goal, we must keep the 
system aware of potentially misleading aspects of its modified response as well. 
Note that R may believe that Q expects to be told the best way. This would change the second axiom to 
include within the scope of the existential quantifier 
(Va){-,(a=b) =~ \[holds(-,fail(Q,C), a(Sc)) ,.% admissible(a(Sc)) & better(b,a)\]} 
3.4. The  only way 
Suppose there is nothing inconsistent about what the user has proposed - i.e., all preconditions are met 
and it will achieve the user's goal. R's direct response would simply be to tell Q how. However, if R 
notices that that is the only way to achieve the goal (of. \[10\]), it could optionally notify Q of that, el. \[111. 
\[101 RB((3la)\[holds(-,fail(q,C),a(Sc)) & admissible(a(Sc)) & a--=drop(Q,C)(Sc~) 
\[1 X l RBQB(RB(want(Q,-fail(Q,C))) 
& RB((3la)\[holds(-ffail(Q,C), a(S?)) & admissible(a(Sc)) & a=drop(Q,C)(Sc~) 
=~ likely(inform-that(R, Q
(3!a )\[holds(- f ait(Q,C),a(Sc)) 
ff admi,eible(a(Sc)) ~ a=drop(Q,C)(Sc)\]), So)) 
R's full response is "You can drop 577 by .... That is the only way to prevent failing." 
3.5.  Someth ing  Turn ing  Up 
Suppose there is no appropriate action that Q can take to achieve his I-goal. That is, 
RB( ~(3 a)\[admissible(a(Se)) & holds(g, a.\[Sc))\]) 
There may still be some event e out of Q's control that could bring about the intended goal. This gives 
several more cases of R's modifying his response. 
3.5.1. Unl ikely event  
If e is unlikely to occur (cf. \[12\]), Q would expect R to inform him of e, while noting its implausibility, cf. 
\[131 
\[12\] RB((3e)\[admissible(e(Sc)) & holds(-,fai!(Q,C), e(Sc)) 
,% -,likely(e, Sc)! ) 
186 
\[,3l RBQB(RB(want(Q,-f~(Q,C)) & o 
RB(-(\]a)\[~missible(a(Sc)) & hold,,(-fail(q,c),a(Se))\] 
(3e)ladmissibl~e(Se)) J~ holds(-fail(Q,C),e(Sc)) 
,~ likely(e,Sc)l) 
=~ likely(inform-that(R, Q
(3 e ffadmissible(e, Sc) ~ holds(- f ail(Q,C), e(Sc)) 
- -  '-,J likelJl(e, Se)\]), So)) 
Thus R's full response is, "You can't drop 577. I f  e occurs, you will not fail  577, but e is unlikely." 
3.5.2. L ikely event  
If the event e is likely (cf. \[14\]), it does not seem necessary to state it, but it is certainly safe to do so. A 
formula representing this case follows. 
\[14\] RB((3 e)\[a.df missihle(e(Sc)) 
holds(fail(q,C),4Sc)) & likely(e,Sc)D 
R's beliefs about Q's expectations are the same as the previous case except that likely(e, Sc) replaces 
-likely(e, Sc). Thus R's full response may be "You can't drop 577. However, e is likely to occur, in which 
case you will not fail  577. s 
3.5.3.  Event  fol lowed by act ion 
If event e brings about a state in which the enabling conditions of an effective action a are true, cf. \[15\] 
\[15\] RB((3e)(3a)\[~lmissible(e(Sc)) & admissible(a(~Sc))) & 
holds(-~rail(q,c), a(e(Sc)))\]) 
!,81 RBqB(12B((3e)(3a)\[want(q,-,fail(q,c)) & admissible(e(Sc)) 
& admi.~ible(a(e(Sc))) & holds(-fail(Q,C),a(e(Sc)))\]) 
=~ likely( in f orm-that(R,Q, 
Oe)Oa ) l oles(-, f ,,i fQ, C),a(e(Sc)))) 
a dmi$sible(a(?(Sc))\])),Sc)) 
then the same principles about informing q of the likelihood or unlikelihood of e apply as they did before. 
In addition, R must inform Q of a, cf. \[16\]. Thus R's full response would be "You can't drop 577. I f  e 
were to occur, which is (un)likely, you could a and thus not fail  577." 
4. Reasoning 
Our intent in using logic has been to have a precise representation language whose syntax informs R's 
reasoning about Q's beliefs. Having computed a full response that conforms to all these expectations, R 
may go on to 'trim' it according to principles of brevity that we do not discuss here. 
Our proposal is that the informing behavior is "pre-compiled'. That is, R does not reason explicitly 
about Q's expectations, but rather has compiled the conditions into a case analysis similar to a 
discrimination net. For instance, we can represent informally several of the cases in section 3. 
If admizsibl~(drop(~f,C~Se)) 
then if holds(fail(q,C),d,' (Q,C Sc)) 
then  begin nonproductive act 
i f  (3b)\[admissible(b(Sc)) ~fi'olds(-f~il(Q,C),b(Sc))\] 
then  a way 
elae n...o way 
end 
else i f  (3b)\[admissible(/~Sc)) & 
187 
holds(-~fail(Q,C),b(Sc)) & better(b,f)\] 
then  a better 
else i f  (3 b)\[ad~s~e(b(Sc}} & holds(-~fail(Q,C), b(Sc))\] 
then  a way 
else n.._o way 
Note that we are assuming that R assumes the most demanding expectations by Q. Therefore, R can 
reason solely within its own space without missing things. 
5. Conclus ion 
Since the behavior of expert systems will be interpreted in terms of the behavior users expect of 
cooperative human experts, we (as system designers} must understand such behavior patterns so as to 
implement them in our systems. If such systems are to be truly cooperative, it is not sufficient for them to 
be simply truthful. Additionally, they must be able to predict limited classes of false inferences that users 
might draw from dialogue with them and also to respond in a way to prevent hose false inferences. The 
current enterprise is a small but non-trivial step in this direction. \[n addition to questions about achieving 
goals, we are investigating other cases where a cooperative xpert should prevent false inferences by 
another agent, including preventing inappropriate default reasoning \[6, J~,VW84nonmon\]. 
Future work should include 
s identification of additional eases where an expert must prevent false inferences by another 
agent, 
? formal statement of a general principle for constaining the search for possible false inferences, 
and 
s design of a natural language planning component to carry out the informing acts ~sumed in 
this paper.
