1. In t roduct ion  
When using hierarchical formalisms for lexical infor- 
mation, the need arises to insert (i.e. classify) lexical 
items into these hierarchies. This includes at least the 
following two situations: (1) testing generalizations 
when designing a lexical hierarchy; (2) transferring 
large numbers of lexical items from raw data files to a 
finished lexical hierarchy when using it to build a large 
lexicon. Lip until now, no automated system for these 
insertion tasks existed. INSYST (INserter SYSTem), 
we describe here, can efficiently insert lexical items 
under the appropriate nodes in hierarchies. It currently 
handles hierarchies specified in the DATR formalism 
(Evans and Gazdar 1989, 1990). The system uses a 
classification algorithm that maximizes the number of 
inherited features for each entry. 
2. The  INSYST-Arch i tec ture  
The following information is required by the INSYST- 
Classifier module: i) the features that can be inherited 
from each node of the hierarchy, and ii) the features of 
the item to be inserted. Since the answer to i) is not 
explicitly stated in the DATR specification of a node, 
three modules preprocess the input DATR theory: the 
INSYST-Compiler and the INSYST-Inheritance 
Closure modules. The INSYST-Interface to the 
database answers question (ii). The modules are 
implemented in C. Figure 1 presents a pictoral view of 
the interactions between INSYST modules. 
2.1 The INSYST-Compiler and Inheritance Closure 
modules 
The INSYST-Compiler eads the input DATR theory 
from a file, creates nodes and inserts the path-value 
pairs into them as they are encountered. 
The Inheritance Closure module loops through the 
node list provided by the Compiler, calling a recursive 
function that "expands" path-value pairs, for each path- 
value pair in each node. This "expansion" is necessary 
because of the complex DATR inheritance 
mechanisms: default inheritance (anode inherits all the 
values for paths that start with a certain prefix from a 
parent node), global inheritance, mbedded paths, lists, 
etc. In a first pass (Inheritance Closure I), all inheri- 
tances are resolved and listed, except for the global 
(quoted) paths. These are resolved on a second pass 
(Inheritance Closure II), when a node is being inserted, 
because the values for the global paths are taken from 
that node currently being inserted. 
2.2 The INSYST-Classifier 
The INSYST-Classifier algorithm (s. Light, forthc.) 
strives to maximize the number of path-value pairs a 
new entry node inherits while minimizing the number 
of parents. It uses the following heuristic: choose the 
parent from which the node being inserted can inherit 
the most path-value pairs while counting clashes 
between a potential parent node path-value pair and a 
new entry path-value pair. The algorithm is computa- 
tionally tractable and always produces a reasonable 
solution. However, a solution involving fewer parents 
may exist. 
3. Conc lus ion  
By building an inserter system for DATR with its 
particulary complex inheritance f atures (default inhe- 
ritance, embedded paths, etc.), we have shown the 
plausibility of our design. We feel that INSYST or 
systems like it will become a standard tool for 
researchers u ing or designing lexical hierarchies.
