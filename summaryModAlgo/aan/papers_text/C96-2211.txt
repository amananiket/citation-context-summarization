The source a.nd target rules, that is, the CFG rules with 
no constraints, are called the CFG skdeton of the pat- 
terns. The notion of a syntactic hea.d is simila.r to that 
used in unification grammars, although the hea.ds in our 
pa.tterns are simply ene\[~ded a.s cha.racter strings ra.ther 
than as complex feature structures. A head is typica.lly 
introduced 5 in pretermina.1 rules such a.s 
lea~e ~ V V ~- partir 
where, two w~rbs, '"leave" a.nd "partir," are associated 
with the heads of the nonterminal  symbol V. This is 
equiwdently expressed as 
lea~e:l --* V:I V:I +-- pa.rtir:l 
which is physica.lly implemented as a.n entry of a. lexicon. 
A set T of transla.tion patterns is said to accept an 
input s iff there is a. deriva.tion se, quence Q for s using 
the source CFG skeletons of T, a.nd every head constra.int 
a.ssoeia.ted with the CFG skeletons in Q is sa.tisfied. Sim- 
ilarly, T is sa.id to translate s iff there is a synchronized 
derivation sequence Q for s such tha.t T accepts s, and 
every hea.d and link constraint associa.ted with the source 
and ta.rget CFG skeletons in Q is satisfied. The deriw> 
lion Q then produces a transla.tion t a.s the, resulting se- 
quence of terminal symbols included ill the ta.rget CFG 
skeletons in Q. Transla.tion of an input string s essen- 
tially consists of the following thre, e steps: 
? Parsing s by using the source CFG skeletons 
? Propagat ing link eonstra.ints from source to target 
CFG skeletons to build a ta.rget CFG deriva.tion se- 
qllen(:e 
? Generat ing t from the target CFG deriva.tion se- 
quence 
The third step is trivia.1 a.s in the case. of STAG transla.- 
tion. 
Some imlnedia.te results follow from the a.bove defini- 
tions.(Takeda., 1996) 
1. Let a. CFG gramma.r (4 be a. set of source CFG skele- 
tons in T. Then, T accet)ts a. context-free, la.nguage 
(CFL), de.noted by L(1 ), such tha.t L('I ) L(G). 
2. Let a CFG grammar H be a. subset of source CFG 
skeletons in T snch tha.t a. source CF(\] skeleton k is 
in It iff k has no head constraints assoeia.ted with it. 
rl3 tl(} II , :\[~ ~1'(; (' I '  t S '1, ~11 \ [ '~et  IJ(\]~) Of I \ [ l , ' \ [gl '  }l,g(~ L (~\ ] )  . 
3. L(T) is a proper subset of L(G) if, for exami)le , 
there exists a. pa.ttern p (C T) with a sonrce CFG 
rule X ~ Xi ' "Xv  such tha.t 6 
(a.) p has a. head constraint h :X  for some nonter- 
minal symbol Xi (i = 1,2, . . . ,  h). 
(b) T ha.s a, deriva.tion sequence X --4 . .. -4 'w such 
tha.t X is assoeia,ted with a head g (h, ;/: g), 
and T has no se, quenee of nonterminal  symbols 
~q. . .}~ that derives exactly the same set of 
strings a.s X does. 
5A nonterminal symbol X in a source or target CFG rule X -~ 
XI" "  Xk can only be consl.rained to have one of the heads in 
the RHS .X1 " ' Xk. Thus, monotonicity of he~d cnnstraints holds 
throughout the parsing process. 
"This is not a necessary condition for L(T) C L(G'). It is prov- 
able that for any set T of patterns, there exists a (weakly) equiva- 
lent CFG grammar F, with possibly exponentially more grammar 
rules, such that L(T) = L(F). A decision problem of two Cl.'l,s, 
L(T) C L(G), is solwdJle if\[ L(b') = L(G). 'Fhis includes an un- 
decidable problem, L(F) = E*. Theret'ore, we can conclude that 
L(T) C L(G) is mtdecidable. Similar discussions ean be found in 
the literature on Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar(Gaz(lar 
et al, 1985). 
Although our "pa.tterns" have no more deseriptiw'~ 
power than CFG, they c, an provide considerably better 
descriptions of the domain of locality than ordinary CFG 
rules. For example, 
be:V:1 year:NP:2 old --, VP:I VP:I 4-- avoir:V:il au:NP:2 
can h~ndle sueh NP pairs as "one yea.r" and "un a.n," 
a.nd "more than two yea.rs" a.nd "l)hls que deux alIS," 
which would haare to be covered by a la.rge numl)er of 
plain CFG rules. TAGs, on the other ha.nd, are known 
to be "mildly context-sensitive" gra.mma.rs, and they ea.n 
ca.pture a wider ra.nge of synta.etic dependencies, such as 
cross-serial depe, ndencies. The computat ional  complex- 
ity of pa.rsing fbr TAGs, however, is ()(\[G\]n?), which is 
t3.r greaW, r than tha.t of CFG parsing. Moreover, defin- 
ing a. new STAG rule is not a.s easy for the users as just 
adding an entry into a. dietiona.ry, beca.use ca.oh STAG 
rule ha.s to be speeifie, d a.s a. pair of synta.etic tree struc- 
tures. Our pa.tterns, on the other hand, ca,n be spe, cified 
as easily as 
to leave * -- de quitter * 
to l)e yea.r:* old = d'avoir an:* 
by the users, lie, re, the wildcard "*" stands for a.n NP by 
defa.nlt. The prepositions %o" a.nd "de" a.re merely ttsed 
to specify that these patterns are for VPs, and they a.re 
removed when compiled into interna.\[ forms so tha.t these 
pa.tterns axe a.pplica.ble to finite a.s well a.s infinite forms. 
Simila.rly, "to be" is used to show that the phrase is a 
be,-verb and its complement. The wiklea.rds ca.n be con- 
stra.ined with a. hea.d, a.s in "year:*" and %a:*". It, addi- 
tion, they ca.n be a.ssociated with a.n explMt nonterminal  
symbol such a.s "V:*" or "A\])JP:*" (e.g., '"leave:V:*"). 
By defining a. few such nota.tions, these, pa.tterns ca.n 1)e 
successfully conw~,rted into the forma.1 representations de- 
fined a.bow:. The notations a.re so simple tha.t even a. 
novice PC user should ha.re no trouble in writ ing our 
pa.tte, rns, a.s if it(; or site were lnaking a. voca.bula.ry list 
for English or French ex~mls. 
3 Pat tern -Based  Trans la t ion  A lgor i thm 
A parsing a.lgorithm for translat ion patterns ca.n be any 
of the known CFG parsing algorithms, including CKY 
and Ea.rley a.lgorithms. It should be first noted, however, 
that CFG could produce exponentb~lly ambiguous parses 
for some input, in which ease we can only apply heuristic 
or stochastic measurement to select the most promising 
pa.rse. 
It is known tha.t an l!\]a.rley-ba.sed parsing a.lgo- 
r ithm can be made to run in O(\](;\]Kn a) :ra.ther tha.n 
O(JaJ2n:'),(iVla.ruya.ma., 1993; Graham et al, 1980) 
where K is the number of distinct nonternfinal symbols 
in the gramma.r G. We ca.n expect a. very etfide.nt pa.rser 
tbr our pa.tterns, r The input string ca.n a.lso be scanned 
to reduce the number of relewmt gramma.r ules before 
pa.rsing, e The combined process is a.lso known as offline- 
parsing in LTAC,. 
Handling aml)iguous parses is a. difficult task. The ba- 
sic strategy for choosing a candida.te pa.rse during Eaxley- 
based pa.rsing ix a.s tbllows: 
1. Prei~;r a pa.ttern p with a source CFG skeleton X --~ 
Xt ' "  Xk over a.ny other pa.ttern q such that the 
source CFG ske, leton of q is X -4 X , . . .X t : ,  and 
such tha.t Xi in p ha.s a head constraint h, if q has 
h. : Xi (i = 1 , . . . , k ) .  The pa.ttern p is said to be 
mort: specific tha, n q. This relation is similar to a. 
subsumt)tion rela.tionship(Pollard and Sag, 1987). 
rSchabes and Waters(Schabes and Waters, 1995) also discuss 
sewu'al techniques for optimizing parsing algoritlmm. 
SSuch scanning is essential for some languages with no explicit 
word bounda.ries ( uch as Japanese and Chinese).
