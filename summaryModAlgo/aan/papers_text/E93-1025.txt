Abstract 
We give an analysis of ellipsis resolution 
in terms of a straightforward iscourse 
copying algorithm that correctly predicts 
a wide range of phenomena. The treat- 
ment does not suffer from problems inher- 
ent in identity-of-relations analyses. Fur- 
thermore, in contrast o the approach of 
Dalrymple t al. \[1991\], the treatment di- 
rectly encodes the intuitive distinction be- 
tween full NPs and the referential elements 
that corefer with them through what we 
term role linking. The correct predictions 
for several problematic examples of ellip- 
sis naturally result. Finally, the analysis 
extends directly to other discourse copying 
phenomena. 
1 Introduction 
A simple example of verb phrase (VP) ellipsis is given 
in sentence (1): 
(1) John likes his mother, and Bill does too. 
The stranded auxiliary in the second clause indi- 
cates the deletion of a verb phrase, the meaning of 
which is to be determined from another clause, in 
this case, the first clause. Following Dalrymple, et 
al. \[1991\], we term the clause that the VP is copied 
from the source clause, and the clause which contains 
the elided VP the target clause. As is well established 
in the literature, referential elements 1 in the source 
clause VP may give rise to strict/sloppy ambiguities 
1 For present purposes, we will use the term referential 
elements as synonymous with pronouns. In Section 5 we 
discuss how this class may be extended to include implicit 
arguments as well. 
in the target clause; for example in sentence (1) the 
target clause may receive one of two readings, namely 
one in which Bill likes John's mother (the strict read- 
ing), and one in which Bill likes his own mother (the 
sloppy reading). 
In this paper we address the distribution of 
strict and sloppy readings in VP-ellipsis and other 
anaphoric phenomena. In Section 2 we discuss prob- 
lems with past approaches, as well as support our 
decision to treat ellipsis resolution as a primarily se- 
mantic process. In Section 3 we give a representation 
for events that exhibits what we term role linking 
between referential elements and their referents, and 
describe an algorithm for ellipsis resolution that uses 
this representation. Section 4 demonstrates how use 
of this representation and algorithm results in the 
correct analysis of several problematic cases of ellip- 
sis without appeal to additional constraints. In Sec- 
tion 5 we argue that the strict/sloppy distinction is 
not a property of ellipsis alone, but is instead inher- 
ent in what we term the discourse copying process. 
Several discourse copying phenomena t the event 
and NP level are shown to be accounted for by our 
algorithm. We conclude in Section 6. 
2 Past Approaches 
Much attention has been paid to the ellipsis prob- 
lem in linguistics (e.g., \[Dahl, 1972; Dahl, 1974; 
Fiengo and May, 1990; Gawron and Peters, 1990; 
Ha'lk, 1987; Hellan, 1988; Klein, 1987; Lappin, 1992; 
Sag, 1976; Williams, 1977\]), as well as in natural 
language processing (e.g., \[Dalrymple t al., 1991; 
Hardt, 1992; Lappin and McCord, 1990; Priist et 
al., 1991\]). We begin by briefly pointing out several 
problems with some of these approaches. 
.Syntactic accounts of ellipsis (e.g., \[Fiengo and 
May, 1990; Ha'/k, 1987; Hellan, 1988; Lappin, 1992; 
203 
Lappin and McCord, 1990\]) posit the copying of syn- 
tactic structure from the source clause representation 
to the target clause representation. 2 Such accounts 
fail to explain certain empirical facts. First, an ac- 
tive voice target clause can obtain its representation 
from a passive voice source clause (and vice versa), 
but in these cases there is no surface syntactic VP 
constituent to copy: 
(2) A lot of this material can be presented 
in a fairly informal fashion, and often I
do. (from text of \[Chomsky, 1982\]) 
(3) This problem was to have been looked 
into, but obviously nobody did. 
(Vincent Della Pietra, in conversation) 
Second, an elliptical clause can obtain its referent 
from an event representation evoked into the dis- 
course world by a nominalization: 
(4) Meanwhile, they sense a drop in visitors 
to the city. Those who do, they say, axe 
not taking cabs. (Chicago Tribune, 
courtesy Gregory Ward) 
Third, an elliptical clause may have multiple an- 
tecedents: 
(5) Mary wants to go to Spain and Fred 
wants to go to Peru, but because of limited 
resources, only one of them can. 
(\[Webber, 1978\]) 
Several semantic accounts of ellipsis utilizing log- 
ical forms have been proposed. Following Dalrym- 
ple et at. \[1991\], we distinguish between identity-of- 
relations analyses (e.g., \[Gawron and Peters, 1990; 
Klein, 1987; Sag, 1976; Williams, 1977\]) and non- 
identity analyses \[Dalrymple t al., 1991\]. Identity- 
of-relations analyses treat source clauses as having 
ambiguous derivations, with target clauses receiving 
one such derivation. For example, the source clause 
in example (1) would have derivations that (at some 
level) lead to the following two interpretations: 
John has the property P where: 
(6) P = likes John's mother 
(7) P = likes his own mother 
These two properties lead to the same reading for 
the source clause. However, under an identity-of- 
relations analysis, if the target receives a strict inter- 
pretation, then necessarily (6) is the correct interpre- 
tation for the source, whereas if the target receives 
a sloppy reading, then (7) is necessarily the correct 
interpretation. 
The following example, from Dalai \[1972\], is 
termed as n case of cascaded ellipsis in Dalrymple, et 
al. \[1991\], and is problematic for identity-of-relations 
analyses: 
2Fiengo and May \[Fiengo and May, 1990\] actually 
posit copying of LF representations, but their analysis 
shares the problems of the syntactic accounts. 
(8) John realizes that he is a fool, but Billi 
does not, even though hisi wife does. 
An acceptable, and perhaps preferred, reading for (8) 
is: 
(9) John realizes that John is a fool, but 
Bill does not realize that Bill is a fool, 
even though Bill's wife realizes Bill is a fool. 
Example (8) contains two cases of ellipsis; the 
reading in (9) results from the second clause receiv- 
ing a sloppy interpretation from the first and the 
third clause receiving a strict interpretation from 
the second. An identity-of-relations analysis, how- 
ever, specifically predicts that the reading given in 
(9) does not exist. Because the second clause will 
have the sloppy derivation received from the first, 
the strict derivation that the third clause requires 
from the second will not be present. 
Dalrymple, et at. \[1991\] (henceforth DSP) give an 
account of ellipsis resolution based on an equational 
analysis utilizing higher-order unification. Unlike 
identity-of-relations accounts, no unmotivated am- 
biguity is predicated to exist for VPs with pronouns, 
instead the ambiguity exists in the resolution process. 
As a result, reading (9) for sentence (8) is correctly 
predicted to exist. 
We step through DSP's analysis of example (1) to 
acquaint he reader with their system. The repre- 
sentation of the source clause in this example is: 
(10) likes(John, mother_of(John)) 
The ellipsis is resolved by deriving a property P such 
that xepresentation (10) results from applying it to 
John: 
(11) P( John) = likes(John, mother_of(John)) 
This derivation yields two solutions: 3 
(12) P = Az.likes(z, mother_of(John)) 
(13) P = Az.likes(z, mother_of(x)) 
To generate a reading for the target clause, either 
one of these representations may he applied to the 
element in the target clause that is parallel to John, 
in this case Bill. 4. Applying relation (12) to Bill 
yields the strict reading in (14); applying relation 
(13) yields the sloppy reading given in (15): 
(14) P( Bill) = likes(Bill, mother_of(John)) 
(15) P( Bili) = likes(Bill, mother_of(Bill)) 
While the DSP account is comprehensive, some 
flaws remain. First, they claim that their analysis 
covers cases of stripping as well as ellipsis. Consider 
the case of stripping in example (16): 
3Strictly speaking, there are four solutions to equation 
(11). DSP employ a notion of primary occurrence to 
constrain property derivation to only these two solutions. 
This point is tangential to our purposes; the interested 
reader should consult Daltymple et at. \[1991\]. 
4The DSP analysis separates the processes of paral- 
lel element determination and ellipsis resolution. Their 
algorithm models the latter process. 
204 
(16) John likes his mother, and Mary's too. 
This sentence has only the following reading: 
(17) John likes John's mother, and John 
likes Mary's mother. 
The representation for the source clause in DSP's 
system is given by: 
(lS) likes(John, mother_of(John)) 
After deriving two possible properties P, either of the 
two readings given in (19) and (20) may be derived: 
(19) P = 2z.likes(John, mother_of(x)) 
P( M ary) = likes(John, mother_of(Mary)) 
Reading: John likes Mary's mother 
(20) P = ~x.likes(z, mother_of(z)) 
P(Mary) = likes(Mary, mother_of(Mary)) 
Reading: Mary likes Mary's mother 
However, only reading (19) actually exists for sen- 
tence (16), so DSP's system overgenerates in this 
case. We return to this example in Section 4.3. 
Second, to account for missing reading exam- 
ples and the 5-reading sentence, DSP postulate an 
unspecified "suitable definition of generalized an- 
tecedent linking", and need to impose an addi- 
tional constraint on property derivation requiring 
that when an element is abstracted over, so must 
its generalized antecedent. These examples are dis- 
cussed in Sections 4.4 and 4.5. Third, their account 
does not extend cleanly to similar phenomena at the 
noun phrase level, a topic we return to in Section 5. 
3 An  Event  Representat ion  and  
A lgor i thm 
We seek an analysis of ellipsis that preserves the ad- 
vantages of the DSP analysis but remedies the prob- 
lems we have noted. The following sections describe 
the event representation a d the resolution algorithm 
that embody our analysis. 
3.1 Event  Representat ion 
To highlight he general mechanism of our approach 
we will utilize a simple, Davidsonian-style data struc- 
ture where events are reified as variables \[Davidson, 
1967\]. For example, sentence (21) will be represented 
by the feature-based vent structure in (23); this cor- 
responds to the more standard logical form given in 
(22)5: 
(21) John sees Mary 
(22) el: see(et), agent(el, John), 
theme(el, Mary) 
5We use semantic role names llke agent and theme 
somewhat loosely. 
(23) el: \[ predicate: see 
agent: John 
theme: Mary \] 
An additional requirement that we impose on the 
representation is what we term role linking. In order 
to link referential elements to their referents, func- 
tions are used to retrieve the value of roles in event 
structures. For example, the function agent(el) 
would be used to link a referential element to John in 
the representation of el in (23), likewise theme(et) 
would be used to link to Mary. Consider sentence 
(24) and its event structure (25): 
(24) Johni likes hisi mother 
(25) e2: \[predicate: likes 
agent: John 
theme: \[obj: mother 
po : agent(e ) \] \] 
The representation of his is a function bearing the 
role of the entity it refers to in the sentence. In 
contrast o the DSP approach, the representation for 
a full NP will appear in an event structure only when 
it is explicitly mentioned in the discourse, e.g., John 
would have appeared twice in (25) only if sentence 
(24) were John likes John's mother. 
When there are several referential elements in a 
clause that are coreferential, each has several poten- 
tial antecedents with which role linking may be es- 
tablished. The following rule governs role linking in 
this case: 
(26) A referential element is linked to the 
most immediate coreferential e ement 
that c-commands it in the syntax. 
Because we encode the distinction between full 
NPs and the referential elements that refer to them, 
we naturally account for the stripping example, as 
discussed in Section 5.3. The fact that we link refer- 
ential elements through the role that their referents 
have in their events, in conjunction with rule (26), al- 
lows us to account for the missing readings examples 
discussed in Section 5.4 and the 5.reading example 
discussed in Section 5.5 without appeal to any ad- 
ditional constraints on the algorithm. We describe 
this algorithm in the next section. 
3.2 Resolut ion Algor i thm 
The discourse copying algorithm utilized by ellipsis 
resolution is summarized as follows: 
1. Identify the source clause representation and 
formulate a parallel structure with unfilled roles 
and modifiers for the target. 
2. Fill roles with entities given in the target clause. 
3. Copy remaining empty role fillers from the 
source: 
(a) Identify parallel elements, i.e., the objects 
in the source representation corresponding 
205 
to the empty roles in the target, s 
(b) All role fillers may be (i) referred to, where 
the appropriate function is used to link the 
role filler to the corresponding object in 
the source representation. In the case that 
the role filler is a function with a link to 
the source event, it may also be (ii) copied, 
where a new instantiation of the function 
is created and the source event variable is 
replaced with its corresponding parallel tar- 
get event variable. 
As with the DSP analysis, this discourse copying 
method oes not assume any ambiguity in the source 
clause. Ambiguities are generated by the choice 
given in Step 3b; referring will result in a strict read- 
ing and copying will result in a sloppy reading. 
4 T reatment  o f  Phenomena 
We show how our algorithm accounts for a variety 
of ellipsis phenomena. Section 4:1 illustrates that 
a basic case of strict and sloppy ambiguity is cor- 
rectly analyzed. Section 4.2 shows that the algo- 
rithm accounts for the cascaded ellipsis case, thereby 
retaining the advantages of the DSP approach over 
identity-of-relations anMyses. The remaining subsec- 
tions show how our algorithm accounts for the cases 
cited as problematic for DSP in Section 2. Section 
5 will then move beyond VP-ellipsis to discuss how 
related non-elliptical phenomena are accounted for. 
4.1 El l ipsis 
We consider example (1) again, renumbered as (27): 
(27) John likes his mother and Bill does too. 
The representation for the source clause in (27) is: 
(28) el: \[ predicate: like 
agent: John 
theme: \[obj: mother 
poss: agent(el) \]\] 
The parallel event for the target is constructed 
(Step 1), and Bill is added as the agent (Step 2): 
(29) e2: \[ predicate: 
agent: Bill 
theme:\]  
Step 3b can only refer to the value of the predi- 
cate role. 7 Since the theme of the source event con- 
tains a referential link to the source event itself, Step 
eWe follow the DSP analysis in distinguishing the pro- 
cess of determining paxallel elements from the process of 
performing resolution. For all of the examples considered 
in this paper, one can assume that parallel elements share 
the same thematic role in their respective vents. The 
reader is advised to consult Dalrymple t al. \[1991\] for 
arguments on why this constraint should be broadened. 
7Step 3a of the algorithm as stated requires that 
a function be used when referring, i.e., technically we 
should fill the predicate role of e2 with the function 
predicate(el). To improve readability, when the object 
3b allows the theme to either be referred to with a 
function or copied by creating a new instantiation of
the function occupying thetheme and replacing the 
event variable el with its parallel event variable e2. 
Referring to the theme role of el yields the strict 
reading in (30): 
(30) e2: \[predicate: like 
agent: Bill 
theme: theme(el) \]
Reading: Bill likes John's mother 
Conversely, copying the theme role of el yields the 
sloppy reading in (31): 
(31) eu: \[ predicate: like 
agent: Bill 
theme: \[obj: mother 
poss: agent(e2) \] \] 
Reading: Bill likes Bill's mother 
Note that if the his in sentence (27) refers to 
the mother of someone in external discourse, say 
agent(co), then Step 3b must leave this intact since 
the link is not to the source event. This correctly 
yields the only available reading for the target clause 
in this case. 
4.2  Cascaded Ell ipsis 
We show how our analysis accounts for the cascaded 
ellipsis case discussed in Section 2, repeated below: 
(32) John realizes that he is a fool, but Billi 
does not, even though hisi wife does. 
In particular, we work though the derivation of 
example (32) that leads to reading (33), the reading 
that is problematic for identity-of-relations analyses: 
(33) John realizes that John is a fool, but 
Bill does not realize that Bill is a fool, 
even though Bill's wife realizes Bill is a fool. 
The representation for the first clause in (32) is 
given in (34): 
(34) el: \[ predicate: realize 
agent: John 
theme: e2: \[ predicate: be 
agent: agent(el) 
be_pred: fool \] \] 
The clause represented by (34) is the source for the 
elided second clause. To obtain the desired reading, 
Step 3b chooses the copy option to yield the sloppy 
reading. A new function is instantiated from the 
function in the agent role of e2, and the event variable 
el is replaced with its parallel event variable ca: 
being referred to contains no links to any event, we will 
opt to reproduce the value in the role of the target rep- 
resentation rather than use a function. 
206 
(35) es: \[predicate: realize 
polarity: negative 
agent: Bill 
theme: e4: \[predicate: be 
agent: agent(el) 
be_pred: fool \] \] 
Reading: Bill does not realize that Bill is a fool 
The clause represented by (35) is the source for 
the elided third clause. In this case Step 3b chooses 
to refer to the agent of e4 using a function, deriving 
the strict reading: s 
(36) e~: \[predicate: realize 
agent: \[ obj: wife 
poss: agent(ea) \]
theme: e6: \[predicate: be 
agent: agent(e4) 
be_pred: fool \] \] 
Reading: Bill's wife realizes that Bill is a fool 
Thus, the reading not derivable by identity-of- 
relations analyses is derivable by our algorithm. 
4.3 Str ipping 
We now show how our analysis accounts for the strip- 
ping example discussed in Section 2, repeated below: 
(37) John likes his mother, and Mary's too. 
In the DSP analysis it is possible to derive the 
following non-existent reading: 
(38) John likes John's mother, and Mary 
likes Mary's mother. 
Our algorithm generates only the correct reading 
for sentence (37). The representation for the source 
clause in example (37) is: 
(39) el: \[predicate: like 
agent: John 
theme: \[obj: mother 
poss: agent(el)\]\] 
To derive a representation for the target clause, 
we create a parallel event structure (Step 1) and fill 
in the parallel element representation for Mary (Step 
2). The remaining empty role fillers are that for the 
predicate and agent roles. Since neither contains a 
link to the source event, Step 3b only has the option 
of referring to it: 
(40) e2: \[predicate: like 
agent: John 
theme: \[obj: mother 
poss: Mary \] \] 
Reading: John likes Mary's mother 
SWe omit the feature for polarity when it is positive, 
as in representation (36). 
This yields the correct interpretation for the target 
clause. Because Mary is parallel to the only element 
in the source clause that contains a role link in exam- 
ple (37), Step 3b(ii) of the algorithm is never entered. 
As a result, no ambiguity exists and therefore (40) is 
the only derivable reading. 
4.4 Missing Readings 
One might expect hat for source VPs which contain 
N referring elements, 2N readings would be possi- 
ble. However, Dahl \[1974\] noticed that the following 
example has only three readings, not four: 
(41) Bill believed that he loved his wife, and 
Harry did too. 
Out of the expected readings (42a)-(42d), reading 
(42d) is missing: 
(42a) Harry believed that Bill loved Bill's wife. 
(42b) Harry believed that Harry loved Harry's 
wife. 
(42c) Harry believed that Harry loved Bill's wife. 
(42d) # Harry believed that Bill loved Harry's 
wife. 
Because he c-commands his in sentence (41), by 
rule (26) the pronoun his is linked to the pronoun he 
instead of directly to Bill. The event structure for 
the source clause in (41) is therefore: 
(43) el: \[ predicate: believe 
agent: Bill 
theme: e2: \[ predicate: love 
agent: agent(el) 
theme: \[obj: wife 
poss: agent(e2)\]\]\] 
We show that the reading in (42d) is correctly pre- 
dicted not to exist by applying the algorithm to de- 
rive all possible readings for the target clause. Step 
3b will have two options for each of the role links 
occupying the agent role of e~ and the poss role of 
the theme role of e2, resulting in a total of four pos- 
sibilities. In the first case both objects are referred 
to, yielding the all-strict reading given in (42a): 
(44) el: \[predicate: believe 
agent: Harry 
theme: el: \[predicate: love 
agent: agent(e2) 
theme: theme(e~) \] \] 
Reading: Harry believed that Bill loved Bill's wife 
In the second case both functions are copied, yielding 
the all-sloppy reading given in (42b): 
(45) e3: \[ predicate: believe 
agent: Harry 
theme: e4: \[predicate: love 
agent: agent(e3) 
theme: \[obj: wife 
po : agent(e4)\]\]\] 
207 
Reading: Harry believed that Harry loved 
Harry's wife 
In the third case the function occupying the agent 
role of e2 is copied and the structure occupying the 
theme role of eg. is referred to, yielding reading (42c): 
(46) ca: \[predicate: believe 
agent: Harry 
theme: e4: \[predicate: love 
agent: agent(ca) 
theme: theme(e~) \] 
Reading: Harry believed that Harry loved 
Bill's wife 
These three readings are the acceptable ones for the 
target clause in (41). The algorithm also allows for 
a fourth possibility in which the function occupying 
the agent role of eg. is referred to, and the function 
occupying the theme role of e2 is copied: 
(47) ca: \[predicate: believe 
agent: Harry 
theme: e4: \[ predicate: love 
agent: agent(e2) 
theme: \[obj: wife 
poss: agent(e4)\]\]\] 
Reading: Harry believed that Bill loved Bill's 
wife 
In this case the function agent(e4) returns the value 
of agent(e2), namely Bill, which again yields the all- 
strict reading in (42a). Thus, the non-existent read- 
ing given in (42d) is not derivable by the algorithm. 
This behavior is a result of our choosing to link 
referential elements to their referents via their roles 
in the event structures. During the derivation of the 
representation given in (47), we chose the sloppy op- 
tion for the second referential element. Instead of 
replacing the element itself with its parallel element 
in the event structure as other accounts do, we re- 
placed it with a link to its parallel role in its parallel 
event. This process was "sloppy" in th~ the result- 
ing link is to the agent of e4 instead of to the agent 
of ez; however, the resulting effect is "strict" because 
the agent of e4 is the same as e2 in this case. 
The use of c-command as the linking criterion ex- 
plains why m~ny speakers get al four expected read- 
ings in (48) and (49), which ~re otherwise very sim- 
ilar to (41): 
(48) Bill believed that his wife loved him, 
and Harry did too. 
(49) Bill believed that his wife loved his 
brother, and Harry did too. 
Since neither pronoun c-commands the other in these 
cases, the event structure for the source clause would 
have both directly linked to Bill, and the algorithm 
would derive all four readings for the target clause. 
Sag \[1976\] however notes that example (50) only has 
three readings: 
(50) Edith said that finding her husband 
nude had upset her, and Martha did too. 
Out of the four possibilities for the target, reading 
(51) is missing: 
(51) # Martha said that finding Martha's 
husband nude had upset Edith. 
The algorithm derives only the three correct read- 
ings if the first instance of her in sentence (50) 
is linked to the second. Since neither pronoun c- 
commands the other, this violates the linking rule. 
However, as noted by Reinhart \[1983\] (pp. 179- 
180), "experiencing" verbs such as upset often pose 
problems for linguistic analyses utilizing c-command. 
What is required for the linking rule is a notion of a 
reflexive context that applies to pronouns of all cases 
(for which c-command is an imperfect approxima- 
tion). For instance, the NP her husband in sentence 
(50) is in a reflexive context, i.e., replacing 'her hus- 
band' with an accusative pronoun referring to Edith 
requires the reflexive form: 
(52) ... finding herselfi/*heri nude had upset her/. 
Because the her in her husband in sentence (50) is 
in the reflexive context of the second her, the cor- 
responding role link is required in the event struc- 
ture. Thus, the algorithm works correctly for exam- 
ple (50); the flaw arises from using c-command in the 
linking rule to model reflexive contexts. In the fu- 
ture we expect o revise the linking rule by adopting 
rules superseding c-command for predicting reflex- 
ivization. The question of whether our analysis can 
be considered purely semantic rests on the question 
of whether eflexivization is syntactically or seman- 
tically controlled. 
4.5 5-Reading Example 
DSP discuss the following example (from Gawron 
and Peters \[1990\]) as a point of departure among 
previous analyses: 
(53) John revised his paper before the teacher 
did, and Bill did too. 
DSP claim that this sentence has five readings; we 
agree. The DSP analysis as presented erives six 
readings. To obtain only the correct five readings, 
they appeal to the constraint on abstracting over 
generalized antecedents mentioned in Section 2; how- 
ever, a precise method for linking elements to gener- 
alized antecedents i  not given. Our algorithm gen- 
erates only the correct five readings without appeal 
to any additional constraints or processes. 
The notably absent reading for the third clause in 
this case is given in (54): 
(54) Bill revised John's paper before the 
teacher evised Bill's paper. 
We step through the derivation of some of the 
readings to show that no representation for reading 
208 
? ? .  
(54) is derived. 9 We first derive the possible read- 
ings for the first ellipsis. The representation for the 
source clause is: 
(55) el: \[predicate: revise 
agent: John 
theme: \[ obj: paper 
poss: agent(el) \] \] 
We add the temporal modifier, parallel event 
structure, and role fillers for the representation of
the first elided clause: 
(56) ex: \[predicate: revise 
agent: John 
theme: \[obj: paper 
poss: agent(el) \] 
time: \[relation: before 
obj: e2: \[predicate: revise 
agent: teacher 
theme:\]  \ \] 
The filler of the theme role in the representation 
for the source event contains a link to that, so there 
are two options. First, the theme may be referred to, 
yielding the strict reading: 
(57) el: \[ predicate: revise 
agent: John 
theme: \[obj: paper 
poss: agent(el) \] 
time: \[ relation: before 
obj: e2: \[predicate: revise 
agent: teacher 
theme: theme(et)\]\]\] 
Reading: The teacher evised John's paper 
Alternatively, the theme may be copied, yielding 
the sloppy reading: 
(58) el: \[predicate: revise 
agent: John 
theme: \[obj: paper 
poss: agent(el) \] 
time: \[relation: before 
obj: e2: 
\[ predicate: revise 
agent: teacher 
theme: \[ obj: paper 
poss: agent(e2)\]\]\] 
Reading: The teacher evised the teacher's paper 
We now consider the readings for the second el- 
lipsis. Unlike the case of cascaded ellipsis, in this 
example the second ellipsis has the entire conjoined 
clause as its source. We first consider the readings 
derived from the strict reading represented in (5?). 
9We thank an anonymous reviewer for pointing out a 
flaw with a slightly different manifestation f this account 
in predicting the correct readings for this example. 
In each of the following derivations event ea is par- 
allel to event el, and event e4 is parallel to e2. Af- 
ter the event and non-referential role information is 
copied, there are four options. Referring to both of 
the roles containing links to a source event results in 
the all-strict reading: 
(59) ca: \[ predicate: revise 
agent: Bill 
theme: theme(et) 
time: \[relation: before 
obj: e4: \[predicate: revise 
agent: teacher 
theme: theme(e~)\]\]\] 
Reading: Bill revised John's paper before the 
teacher evised John's paper 
In the second possibility, both roles can be copied, 
resulting in the all-sloppy reading: 
(60) ca: \[ predicate: revise 
agent: Bill 
theme: \[ obj: paper 
poss: agent(ca) \]
time: \[ relation: before 
obj: e4: \[ predicate: revise 
agent: teacher 
theme: theme(ca) \]\]\] 
Reading: Bill revised Bill's paper before the 
teacher evised Bill's paper 
Third, the poss role of the theme role of el may be 
copied and the theme role of e2 may be referred to: 
(61) ca: \[ predicate: revise 
agent: Bill 
theme: \[obj: paper 
poss: agent(ez) \]
time: \[ relation: before 
obj: e4: \[ predicate: revise 
agent: teacher 
theme: theme(e2) \]\]\] 
Reading: Bill revised Bill's paper before the 
teacher evised John's paper 
Finally, the poss role of the theme role of el may 
be referred to and the theme role of e2 may be copied: 
(62) ca: \[ predicate: revise 
agent: Bill 
theme: theme(el) 
time: \[ relation: before 
obj: e4: \[predicate: revise 
agent: teacher 
theme: theme(ea) \]\]\] 
Reading: Bill revised John's paper before the 
teacher evised John's paper 
Note that the reading (62) is the same as the 
strict/strict reading in (59). Thus, the algorithm so 
209 
far has generated three readings and has not gener- 
ated the non-existent reading (54). We leave it to the 
reader to determine that when using representation 
(58) as the source for the final ellipsis, the following 
two readings are generated: 
(63) Bill revised John's paper before 
the teacher evised the teacher's paper 
(64) Bill revised Bill's paper before 
the teacher evised the teacher's paper 
The algorithm therefore derives all and only the 
correct five readings for example (53). Recall that 
the algorithm's ability to avoid the non-existent 
reading in the missing reading cases in Section 4.4 
was due to our choosing to link referential elements 
to their referents through their roles in the event 
structures. In that case, the critical point that im- 
plicitly eliminated the missing reading occurred ur- 
ing a derivation where the sloppy option was chosen. 
The ability of the algorithm to avoid generating the 
missing reading given in sentence (54) is also due to 
our role linking scheme, but in this case the crucial 
step was in choosing the strict option in the deriva- 
tion of the first ellipsis (which resulted in represen- 
tation (57)). Because the algorithm referred to the 
theme of el through its role instead of replicating it, 
the representation for the non-existent reading could 
not be derived during the resolution of the second 
ellipsis. In either case, accounts that rely on paral- 
lel elements cannot avoid these readings without ap- 
peal to additional constraints. Our analysis requires 
no such constraints; the correct readings naturally 
result from the mechanism itself. 
5 Beyond Ellipsis 
The hallmark of the discourse copying process is the 
need not only to refer to a previously mentioned en- 
tity or event, but to create a new instantiation of it. 
VP-ellipsis is one such process; the meaning of the 
source clause serves as both the referent and the ob- 
ject from which a new, more general instantiation is
created. Here we claim that the strict/sloppy distinc- 
tion is an inherent property of the discourse copying 
process, and therefore not of VP-ellipsis resolution 
alone. Our algorithm is directly applicable to a wide 
variety of discourse copying phenomena at both the 
VP and NP levels. 
All of the following reference phenomena re- 
quire discourse copying, and therefore exhibit 
strict/sloppy ambiguities: 
? VP-ellipsis: John likes his mother, and Bill does 
too. 
? Pronominal Event Anaphora: John got shot by 
his father. That happened to Bob too. 
? Definite Event Anaphora: John kissed his wife, 
and Bill followed his example. (\[Dalai, 1972\]) 
? 'Only': Only John loves his mother. 
s 'One' Anaphora: Although John bought a picture 
of his son, Bill snapped one himself. 
Definite NPs and pronouns referring to NPs may also 
require discourse copying in certain restricted con- 
texts. In these cases, strict/sloppy ambiguities are 
present: 
? De f in i te  NPs :  John actually remembered his 
wife's birthday. Most men forget this important 
date. 
? 'Lazy' Pronouns: The man who gives his pay- 
check to his wife is wiser than the man who 
spends it. (\[Karttunen, 1969\]) 
We make a distinction between the processes of 
determining when discourse copying applies and per- 
forming the resolution. We show how the represen- 
tations of some of these examples are resolved by our 
algorithm. 
The pronouns it and that can be used to refer to 
events. Usage such as that in example (65) requires 
discourse copying since a new instantiation of an ex- 
isting event needs to be applied to the target repre- 
sentation: 
(65) John got shot by his father. 
That happened to Bill too. 
That is, both (66) and (67) are possible readings for 
(65): 
(66) Bill was shot by John's father. 
(67) Bill was shot by Bill's father. 
These readings are generated by the algorithm in 
analogous fashion to the ellipsis cases. The represen- 
tation for the source clause is: 
(68) el: \[ predicate: shot 
agent: \[ obj: father 
poss: theme(el) \]
theme: John \] 
Assuming that Bill is the theme of the target event, 
referring to the agent role yields the representation 
for the strict reading in (69), and copying it yields 
the representation for the sloppy reading in (70): 
(69) e2: \[ predicate: shot 
agent: agent(el) 
theme: Bill \] 
Reading: Bill was shot by John's father 
(70) e2: \[ predicate: shot 
agent: \[ obj: father 
poss: theme(e~) \] 
theme: Bill \] 
Reading: Bill was shot by Bill's father 
Dalai \[1972\] gives similar examples involving a form 
of definite event reference: 
210 
(71) John thinks he is smart, and Bill 
suffers from the same delusion. 
(72) John kissed his wife. Bill followed his 
example. 
Once the VP in the targets are recognized as event 
referential, the algorithm readily applies to these 
cases (with parallel elements being John and BilO, 
as it does not require any degree of syntactic or logi- 
cal form parallelism between the referring expression 
and the referent. 
'One' anaphora lso requires a form of discourse 
copying, although for discourse entities instead of 
events: 
(73) John bought a picture of his son, while 
Bill snapped one himself. 
Most speakers find sentence (73) to be ambiguous 
between strict and sloppy readings, i.e., one could 
refer to a picture of John's son or of Bill's son. 1? 
By applying our analysis to the discourse copying of 
objects, these readings naturally result. The source 
representation for sentence (73) is given in (74): 
(74) el: \[ predicate: bought 
agent: John 
theme: \[ obj: picture 
arg: \[ obj: son 
po : agent(el) \] \]\] 
We construct a representation for the informa- 
tion given in the target sentence without the 'one'- 
anaphoric NP: 
(75) e2: \[predicate: snap 
agent: Bill 
theme:\] 
Step 3b of the algorithm operates in the same way 
as it does for ellipsis; the two choices yield the strict 
reading in (76) and the sloppy reading in (77): 
(76) e2: \[predicate: snap 
agent: Bill 
theme: theme(et) \]
(77) e2: \[predicate: snap 
agent: Bill 
theme: \[obj: picture 
arg: \[ obj: son 
poss: agent(e2) \]\]\] 
As our analysis predicts, no sloppy reading exists if 
his refers to an intersentential discourse object (e.g., 
Fred). 
The cases involving definite NPs and lazy pro- 
nouns can be handled in an analogous fashion to 
'one'-anaphora. However, whereas 'one'-anaphora by
its nature involves discourse copying, the contexts in 
which definite NPs and pronouns can copy as well 
1?Obtaining the sloppy reading may be aided by con- 
sidering a relevant context, such as one where John's and 
Bill's families are on vacation together. 
as refer are more limited. Therefore, the challenge 
in handling these latter cases is in determining when 
discourse copying is licensed. 
As a final note, we point out that the class of 
what we have termed referential elements can be 
extended to include implicit arguments as well as 
pronouns. For instance, consider examples (78) and 
(79), adapted from Partee \[1989\]: 
(78) John went to a local bar to watch 
the Superbowl, and Bob did too. 
(79) George drove to the nearest hospital, 
and Fred did too. 
In sentence (78), local has an implicit argument 
that is linked to John, likewise for nearest and George 
in sentence (79). In each case there are strict and 
sloppy readings for the target clause; e.g., the target 
in example (78) can mean that Bob went to the bar 
local to John, or a bar local to himself. As is the case 
with pronouns, if the implicit argument is instead 
linked to external discourse (e.g., "local" interpreted 
as being to the speaker instead of to John in sentence 
(78)), then there is only one reading for the target; 
no sloppy reading exists. 
Nominalizations can also contain implicit argu- 
ments that give rise to strict and sloppy readings, 
as in example (80): 
(80) The CS500 final exam is tomorrow. 
John fears failure and his brother does too. 
Assuming that John fears his own failure, then 
John's brother may either fear John's failure or his 
own failure. Our algorithm readily handles these 
cases with the appropriate role linking of implicit 
arguments. 
Not included in the class of referential elements 
are empty pronouns within infinitival clauses; these 
do not give rise to strict readings. For example, in 
(81) 
(81) John wants to leave, and Bill does too. 
there is only a sloppy reading for the target; it can- 
not be taken to mean that Bill wants John to leave. 
In our algorithm, the representation for empty pro- 
nouns will always have to be copied. 
6 Summary  
We have given an analysis of ellipsis resolution in 
terms of a straightforward iscourse copying algo- 
rithm that correctly predicts a wide range of phe- 
nomena. The treatment does not suffer from prob- 
lems inherent in identity-of-relations analyses. Fur- 
thermore, in contrast o the approach of Dalrymple 
et al \[1991\], the treatment directly encodes the in- 
tuitive distinction between full NPs and the referen- 
tial elements that eorefer with them, thus allowing 
the correct analysis of the stripping example. Fur- 
thermore, we establish this distinction via the role 
linking scheme we have defined, which also allows 
211 
the correct predictions in the missing readings and 
5-readings cases to come as a natural result. Finally, 
the analysis extends directly to other discourse copy- 
ing phenomena. Future work includes extending the 
analysis to interact with quantificational phenomena.
