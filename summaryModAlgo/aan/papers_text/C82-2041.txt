(b )  how do we go on f rom here  when we want to  exp l i ca te  se -  
mant ic  coherence  w i th in  c lauses  and texts?  
FOr ~hte  spec i f i c  p rob lem i t  i s  impor tant  to  show how 
- and how far  - semant ic  coherence  ta l l i es  w i th  syntact i c  
coherence  and whether  we need cer ta in  t rans format ions  in  
o rder  to  insure  ta l l y ing .  
For  our  purpose ,  namely ,  to  deve lop  a conceptua l  natur -  
a l  l anguage unders tand ing  sys tem for  German (VIE-LANG) we 
used Brachman?s (Brachman 1978) outline of a semantic net to 
construct a conceptual knowledge base. We included ideas from 
a "semanti.clzsd" valence theory, a "semanticIzed" dependency 
~smmar ,  and l ingu is t i c  semant ics  in  genera l .  
We w i l l  now g ive  a shor t  descr ip t ion  o f  the  semant ic  
net  as  used  in  our  p ro jec t .  There  i s ,  a t  f i r s t ,  a h ie rarch ic -  
a l  " layer"  o f  concepts ,  cor respond ing  to  a categor ica l  the -  
saurus  sys tem.  Each  concept  i s  s t ruc tured  v ia  so -ca l led  
ro les  th rough other  concepts  and i t  i s  here  where the  lex ica l  
mean ings  f ind  the i r  p lace .  Ro les  e i ther  resemble  deep cases  
- 171  - 
in a case  grammar - so far, we have identified about 50 cases 
- or they are other vital "constituents'of the semantic con- 
cept to which they belong (e.g. properties). Whereas in the 
hlerarchioal "layer'the relations are those of hyponomy/hypero- 
moray, the relations which lead from concepts via roles to 
conceptual restrlotlons may be interpreted as relations of 
semant ic  compat ib i l i ty  ( se lec t iona l  res t r i c t ions ) ,  to  be 
spec i f ied .  
There  i s  no exp l i c i t  d ichotomy between syntax  and se -  
mant ics .  Syntax  i s  seen  as  a "coarse"  semant ic  (p re - )o rder ing  
- w i th  loopho les  wh ich  have  to  be br idged by t rans format ions .  
Each  concept  in  the  semant ic  net ,  inc lud ing  i t s  ro les  and 
conceptua l  res t r i c t ions ,  can ,  there fore ,  be  in terpreted  e i ther  
as  a semant ic  de f in i t ion ,  o r  as  a semant ic  sentence  pat tern .  
The latter approach accounts for the applicability of a ?se- 
mantlcIzed" valence theory and a "semanticized'dependency 
grammar. 
How do we apply this system to the problem of semantic 
coherence in clauses and texts? The first practical step 
consisted in olasslfylng the forms of semantic coherence and 
integrating them into our system. Accordingly, semantic coher- 
ence is expressed via 
1. Proforms 
1.1. Profornm which can be identified morphologically and 
morphologlcally/syntactlcally 
1.1.1. Purely morphologically: lexemes which can be identif- 
ied as proforms on a purely morphological basis (per- 
sonal pronouns, certain adverbial proforms). 
1.1.2.  Morpho log ica l ly / syntact i ca l ly :  lexemes  wh ich  can  be 
ident i f ied  as  poss ib le  pro forms on a morpho log ica l  
bas i s  but  we need syntact i c  ev idence  fo r  the  dec is ion  
o f  whether  they  rea l ly  a re  pro forms:  possess ive  pro -  
nouns  ( funct ion  as  pro forms on ly  when i so la ted  - non-  
-a t t r ibut ive) ,  cer ta in  adverbs  wh ich  may a l so  funct -  
- 172  - 
i on  as con junct ions ,  cer ta in  in ter rogat ive  pronouns 
which have the same morpho log ica l  shape as re la t ive  
pronotuls ? 
1 .2 ,1 ?  Border l ine  cases ,  border ing  on 1olo.  lexemes and syn-  
tagmas which cannot be ident i f ied  morpho log ica l ly / syn-  
tac t i ca l l y  as proforms, but of  which we know from 
exper ience  that  they do ocouz as proforms:  Din~, tun.  
~eschehen, aus diesem Grund, e tc .  
1.2o2o Semantic proforms per  se:  th i s  group cons is ts  (mainly)  
of  "synonyms',  and, perhaps,  a l l  those lexemes which 
stand in  a cer ta in  subconcept /superconcept  re la t ion  to 
one another ,  ee g . ,  l i ke  Engl ,  oar and veh ic le .  
2. Semantic coherence wi thout  proforms.  These are  de-  
monstrated best  b I an example: In  
(I) Das Haus gehoert mlr. Leider ist das Dach 
(This is my house? Unfortunately the roof is 
sohon baufaelllg, 
in bad shape?) 
we cannot apply any of the abovementioned olassiflcat- 
ion criteria, although it is obvious that semantically 
Haus and Dac_._~h belong together ?  
A f te r  having es tab l i shed  th i s  c lass i f i ca t ion  a mat r ix  
was developed which cod i f ies  a l l  the ava i lab le  morpho log ica l  
~nd syntact i ca l  in fo rmat ion ,  p lus  in fo rmat ion  de l ivered  by the  
concept - ro le  s t ruc ture  of the  net .  In  the matr ix  we f ind  In form-  
a t ion  such as whether a proform subst i tu tes  fo r  a noun phrase,  
a dependent c lause ,  an independent c lause ,  a text ,  an adverb 
e tc? ,  or  a combinat ion of  them, which prepos i t ion  to  expect  in  
an answer to a quest ion  us ing a spec i f i c  in ter rogat ive  pronoun, 
e tc ?  
I t  has a l ready  been es tab l i shed  (Hobbs 1978) that  the 
in fo rmat ion  conta ined in  the morpho log ica l - syntact i c  par t  of 
the matr ix  i s  not  su f f i c ient  to ident i fy  semant ic  coherence in  
- !73  - 
a c lause  or  text .  Even fo r  the  pro forms o f  1 .1 .  i t  i s  not  
su f f i c ient  to  re ly  on the  gender  of  the  pre form to  f ind  the  
cor rect  antecedent .  In  the  exe~nple- 
(2) Der Fisch wird auf den Teller gelegt. Dann esse ich lhn. 
(The fish is put on the plate. Afterwards I eat it.) 
Identification via gender provides us with the information 
that either Fisc h or Teller may be the antecedent of lhn. 
Our concept-role structure, on the other hand, informs us 
that - given ordinary circumstances - only fish are to be 
eaten, whereas plates are not. This is to say that morpholog- 
ical and syntactical knowledge give us an indication where to 
look for semantic coherence in a clause or text (syntax as 
"coarse* semantic (pre-) orderingl), but that we need criter- 
ia from the semantic net in order to be reasonably certain 
of what the proform stands for, or where semantic coherence 
is to be found in case there are no proforms. 
A good example of how the system VIE-LANG works is 
delivered by those syntagmatic adverbial proforms which stand 
for sentences or texts and which belong to 1.2.1.: 
(3) Das Restaurant ist heute geschlossen. Aus diesem Grund 
essen wir zu Hause. (The restauraunt is closed. For this 
reason we have dinner at home.) 
On the semantic "surface" there is nothing which relates 
Grund (reason) to anything else in either one of the two 
clauses. However, from our matrix we do know that aus diesem 
Grund may belong to 1.2.1 and, moreover, that its antecedent 
can only be a main clause or a text which immediately p reced-  
es aus diesem G~do The system also recognizes that Restau- 
rant and essen belong to the same semantic neighborhood. Thus 
it follows that Das Restaurant ist lheute geschlossen assume 
the role +CAUSE with respect to essen wir zu Hause. 
From these examples it should be obvious that semantic 
coherence according to 2, has to be based exclusively on the 
- 174  - 
concept-role structure of the net. F.i., in example (1) se- 
mantic coherence can be made clear only when we know that 
Hau_~s and Dac...~h belong together semantically. How can we achieve 
that? Some scholars assume that a kind of inferencing guides 
us from Hau_..~s to Dach. In our system the lexeme "Haus" would 
be connected  w i th  the  concept  BUILDING, in  which there  ex is ts  
a ro le  ROOF, which i s  the net -s t ruc ture  the  lexeme *Dech ? 
would lead  to .  Ins tant ia t ion  of  a ro le  a lways compr ises  the  
ins tant ia t ion  of the  concept  i t  be longs  to  and the  va lue-  
- res t r i c t ion  respect ive ly .  The re la t ionsh ip  between "Haus" 
and "Dach" becomes c lear  by mere ly  access ing  the  net ,  w i thout  
any in ferences  at  a l lw
