The knowledge representat ion method is introduced 
to be appl ied in  the ICAI system to teach prog~-  
min~ language? Knowledge about syntax and seman- 
ties of that language is represented by a set of 
axioms w~itten in the predicate calculus language, 
The directed graph of concepts is mentioned as a 
method to represent an instr~ct lonal  structure of 
the domain knowledge. The pros\[ procedure to ans- 
wer student's questions is described. 
INTRODUCTION 
The early 70S have brouF~at the Intel l igent CAI / ICAI /  systems \[3~4~o 
In  these systems all  course material  is represented independent ly of 
teachin~ procedures. The goal of ICAI research is to obtain an indi-  
v idual izat ion of inst1~aotion by providin~ an abi l i ty of answerln~ 
studentts questions as wel l  as genel~atin~ remedial  oomments~problems 
and advioes~ aeco1~Lin~ly to current studentPs respormos and his abi-  
l it ies and preferences in general. 
ICAI researchers have f i rst ly focused their invest igat ions on repre- 
sentation of the subject matter .  Mostly semant ic  nets have been used 
as representat ion of static \[~J and procedural  \[~p~\] domain knowled- 
Ge. Database of an instz~ct lo~Ll  system includes also a representa- 
t ion of cur r l cu lumto  or~n lze  an instz~uotlon of new knowledge \[~pY~ 
It is helpful  in  seleotln~ material  to be presented to the student. 
Th?s  paper  presents  the  knowledge representat ion  method based  on pre -  
d icate  calculus in  an intel l igent C AT system~ which is appl ied to 
teach the programmi~ language \[J\]o The prototype of the presented 
approach  w~s an appl icat ion of predloate calculus to descr ibe pro~- 
ramsp wr i t ten in  ALGOL~ to l~ove their oozTe?tness~ introduced by 
~sta l l  \[2\]. The ~aowledge about syntu  and semantlos of" the prog- 
rmmni~ lan6~a~e has been represented in the form of a set of f irst 
oz~er logic axloms~ 
Them are  g iven  some notes  how to  const ruct  the  pred icate  ca lcu lus

Let  us cons ide~ a subset  of an  ALGOL- l l ke  progx~ammin~ lan~uage~con-

subst i tu t ion  and  cond i t iona l  and  o ~  ins t ruct ions .  We assume that 
each ins t ruc t ion  has been  wr i t ten  in  a separate  l ine of program. 
The pred icate  ca lcu lus  language deve loped  to represent  knowledge  a-

Some sorts j  funct ions  and  pred icates  are in t roduced  to represent  
syntax  of the prog~ammlng lan~uage.0thers  represent  its semant ics .  
N o t a t i o n. The  ord inary  pred icate  ca lcu lus  notat ion  has been  
used. Some mod i f i ca t ions  improve  the readab i l i ty  of s tatements :

- parenthes is  a re  used  in  the  ord inary  mean in~ 
- c lauses  are separated  by dots. 
P r o g r a m s y n t a x. The program syntax  has  been  descr ibed  
by a set of c lauses w~i t ten  in  the pred icate  ca lcu lus  language.

DIRECTED GRAPH AS A D~rHOD OF INSTRUCTIONAL STRUCTURE REPRESENTATION 
An assumpt ion is done that al l  knowledge to be tau6ht can be divided 
to instruct ional  units.Thus the f irst step to oonstr~ot an instruc-  
t ional structure representat ion is to select such units /concepts/.  
Each of them has a name and at  least one sentence can be told about 
it /unreal  concepts are not a l lowed/ .Some introductory concepts are 
assumed to  be known to  the student. 
The next step is to specify al l  relat ions between concepts.These re- 
lations could be: 
/a /  Concept X is a part of Y, 
/b/  Concept X has a property~ represented by Z~ 
~ oncept X is a reason Or  a Just i f icat ion of T, 
Concept X belongs to the object class represented by K, 
/e /  Concept X is an alternat ive of A~ 
/ f /  Concept X is equivalent to W at least in  some circumstances. 
Each re lat ion corresponds with a graph, which nodes represent con- 
cepts from an introduced set of concepts.The composit ion of al l  ob- 
tained 6~aphs rerults in  a f inal  graph~whlch represents an instruc-  
t ional structure of the subject matter .Because of the di f ferent in- 
terpretat ion of the part icular  arches of this ~Taph /which are de- 
scr ibed by various re lat ionships/  the "superior- infer ior" re lat ion 
is introduced as the universal  one which represents every re lat ion 
between concepts.Thus the dlrested ~phhas  been obtained,~ith ar- 
rows directed to the super ior  concepts. 
A set of axioms is associated with each node of the concept graph. 
Also some other in format ion may be associated with it. 
ANSWERING STUDENT'S QUESTIONS 
The fo l lowin~ problems have to be solved| 
- choice and specify in~ of classes of user 's  quer ies,which can  
be answered by the ICAI system~ 
- reco@~nition of a main  subject of the query, 
t ranslat ion of the query f rom natural  language to the predicate 
calculus language fo rmula ,  
- appl icat ion of the automated theorem-provin~ techniques to re- 
tr ieve an answer, 
- generat in~ of an answer in natura~ language form. 
Three classes of queries have been qonsidered: 
/ I /  Dec is ion queries of gener~l \ form in natural  language 
<interrogative particle> < sentence> 7 
where: <interrogative part io le>/exist in~ in Pol ish/  deter-

An analysis Of a userts quex-y should f lx  the main subject of it in 
the terms of a subset of conoepts~represented on the concept g~ph.  
A do f iD / t lon  of acceptable language of user 's  queries involves the 
form of translat ion rules f rom n~tux~tl lan~u.age into the predloate 
calculus formula. It is worth not lo ln~ that: 
- querles in  the natural  lar~ua~e ?orm have the threefold nature~ 
it means they can be counted into the three ment ioned above olasses~ 
- queries fragments in  the form of indicat ive clauses are bui lt  
f rom expressed in natural  language p~edloates~introduee~ in the pre-  
sent ed f or~alization~ 
- in respect of quantity of expressions the language of user's 
queries is comparable wi th  the laa1&~e obtained in  the process of 
translat ion of p~ed/oate calculus axioms into natural  lan~ua~e~ 
- lan@uaGe o~ user's queries and the predloate calculus l~a~e 
have a common base of basle concepts because the sorts of ob~eots~ 
functions and pFedicates introduced in the predloate calculus lan- 
guage correspond with some specif ied natural  language expressions. 
It has been submitted that quest lon-answering problem m~y be  solved 
with an appl icat ion o~ auto~te~ theorem-pyo~,in~ teohnlques~ namely 
on the base o\[ the resolut ion principle \[8\] ,This method~ based only 
on the s~rnteac o f  olauses~ doesn't require to control the proo~ pro- 
cedure by the user,The resolut ion prlnelple requires to convert al l  
formulas into the Skolem conjunctive form. Thus each formula beco- 
mes a set of olauses~ each of them bei~E a d ls junot ion of l iterals, 
The quest ion-ans~ering procedure for  deols lon queries tries to pro- 
~e that a negat ion of formula ~ ob%alned after  translat ion of the qu- 
e r~ is false, I? it 's so~ an answer is "Yes". If a proo~ procedure 
appl ied to  the formula in  its a~firmati~/e ~or~ provides a sucoess~ 
an answer is "NO".Some questions may be unsolvable in  the lack of 
kno~le~e.  
The proof procedure ?or  objective queries examines a ?ormula 
~~x (w (x} ~ A (x)) 
18 B. BEGIER 
which is supposed to be fa lse.The proof prroedure tries to retr ieve 
a counter-example, if i% exists, which wi l l  be subst i tuted in the 
place of X o 
I% has been assumed that problem queries are in the impl icat ion form 
after the translat ion proeess. Quest ion-answerin~ procedure for  this 
class of queries has been reduced to such onetwhich tries to retr ie- 
ve an answer f rom one axiom. For the f i rst  subclass of problem que- 
ries a search is made for  an axiom in the impl icat ion form, ~hich 
conclusion embodies the conclusion of the formula obtained f rom the 
tx~ansformed query. The premises of this axiom are an answer? The 
proof procedure appl ied to answer a quest ion of the second subclass 
tries to f ind an axiom~ which premises are impl ied by premises of 
the formula obtained f~om the transformed query. The conclus ion of 
this axiom is an answer. 
The proper way to reduce a number  of clauses taking a part in the 
resolut ion process is to constr,~ct an init ia l  act ive set of clauses 
as a set containing only clauses of axioms concerning concepts reco- 
~LIzed in the query and clauses of formula obtained f rom the query. 
The translat ion rules,appl ied to transform axioms f rom the predica- 
te calculus language into the natural  language expressions t can be 
used also to translate the retr ieved answer to the natural  language? 
CONCLUSIONS 
Descr ibed above ~1o~le~e representat iom method based on predicate 
calculus has been appl ied to the large subset of FORTRAN 1900 \[I\] . 
I% has been sho~n that this method satisf ies cr i ter ia required in 
the ICAI system. An appl icat ion of the predicate calculus language 
to descr ibe knowledge about the programming language provides the 
automated answering of student's quest ions,whlch is the main  advan- 
tage of this method. 
T~Lis method is appl icable to those domains of ~owledge ,  which can 
be represented by the set of f irst or~er logic axioms, wi th  regard 
to their formal ized nature.
