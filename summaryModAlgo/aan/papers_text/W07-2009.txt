Abstract
In this paper we describe the English Lexical
Substitution task for SemEval. In the task,
annotators and systems find an alternative
substitute word or phrase for a target word in
context. The task involves both finding the
synonyms and disambiguating the context.
Participating systems are free to use any lex-
ical resource. There is a subtask which re-
quires identifying cases where the word is
functioning as part of a multiword in the sen-
tence and detecting what that multiword is.
1 Introduction
Word sense disambiguation (WSD) has been de-
scribed as a task in need of an application. Whilst
researchers believe that it will ultimately prove use-
ful for applications which need some degree of se-
mantic interpretation, the jury is still out on this
point. One problem is that WSD systems have been
tested on fine-grained inventories, rendering the task
harder than it need be for many applications (Ide
and Wilks, 2006). Another significant problem is
that there is no clear choice of inventory for any
given task (other than the use of a parallel corpus
for a specific language pair for a machine translation
application).
The lexical substitution task follows on from
some previous ideas (McCarthy, 2002) to exam-
ine the capabilities of WSD systems built by re-
searchers on a task which has potential for NLP
applications. Finding alternative words that can
occur in given contexts would potentially be use-
ful to many applications such as question answer-
ing, summarisation, paraphrase acquisition (Dagan
et al, 2006), text simplification and lexical acquisi-
tion (McCarthy, 2002). Crucially this task does not
specify the inventory for use beforehand to avoid
bias to one predefined inventory and makes it eas-
ier for those using automatically acquired resources
to enter the arena. Indeed, since the systems in
SemEval did not know the candidate substitutes for
a word before hand, the lexical resource is evaluated
as much as the context based disambiguation com-
ponent.
2 Task set up
The task involves a lexical sample of nouns, verbs,
adjectives and adverbs. Both annotators and sys-
tems select one or more substitutes for the target
word in the context of a sentence. The data was
selected from the English Internet Corpus of En-
glish produced by Sharoff (2006) from the Inter-
net (http://corpus.leeds.ac.uk/internet.html). This is
a balanced corpus similar in flavour to the BNC,
though with less bias to British English, obtained
by sampling data from the web. Annotators are not
provided with the PoS (noun, verb, adjective or ad-
verb) but the systems are. Annotators can provide
up to three substitutes but all should be equally as
good. They are instructed that they can provide a
phrase if they can?t think of a good single word sub-
stitute. They can also use a slightly more general
word if that is close in meaning. There is a ?NAME?
response if the target is part of a proper name and
?NIL? response if annotators cannot think of a good
substitute. The subjects are also asked to identify
48
if they feel the target word is an integral part of
a phrase, and what that phrase was. This option
was envisaged for evaluation of multiword detec-
tion. Annotators did sometimes use it for paraphras-
ing a phrase with another phrase. However, for an
item to be considered a constituent of a multiword,
a majority of at least 2 annotators had to identify the
same multiword.1
The annotators were 5 native English speakers
from the UK. They each annotated the entire dataset.
All annotations were semi-automatically lemma-
tised (substitutes and identified multiwords) unless
the lemmatised version would change the meaning
of the substitute or if it was not obvious what the
canonical version of the multiword should be.
2.1 Data Selection
The data set comprises 2010 sentences, 201 target
words each with 10 sentences. We released 300 for
the trial data and kept the remaining 1710 for the
test release. 298 of the trial, and 1696 of the test
release remained after filtering items with less than
2 non NIL and non NAME responses and a few with
erroneous PoS tags. The words included were se-
lected either manually (70 words) from examination
of a variety of lexical resources and corpora or au-
tomatically (131) using information in these lexical
resources. Words were selected from those having a
number of different meanings, each with at least one
synonym. Since typically the distribution of mean-
ings of a word is strongly skewed (Kilgarriff, 2004),
for the test set we randomly selected 20 words in
each PoS for which we manually selected the sen-
tences 2 (we refer to these words as MAN) whilst for
the remaining words (RAND) the sentences were se-
lected randomly.
2.2 Inter Annotator Agreement
Since we have sets of substitutes for each item and
annotator, pairwise agreement was calculated be-
tween each pair of sets (p1, p2 ? P ) from each pos-
sible pairing (P ) as
?
p1,p2?P
p1?p2
p1?p2
|P |
1Full instructions given to the annotators are posted at
http://www.informatics.susx.ac.uk/research/nlp/mccarthy/files/
instructions.pdf.
2There were only 19 verbs due to an error in automatic se-
lection of one of the verbs picked for manual selection of sen-
tences.
Pairwise inter-annotator agreement was 27.75%.
73.93% had modes, and pairwise agreement with the
mode was 50.67%. Agreement is increased if we re-
move one annotator who typically gave 2 or 3 sub-
stitutes for each item, which increased coverage but
reduced agreement. Without this annotator, inter-
annotator agreement was 31.13% and 64.7% with
mode.
Multiword detection pairwise agreement was
92.30% and agreement on the identification of the
exact form of the actual multiword was 44.13%.
3 Scoring
We have 3 separate subtasks 1) best 2) oot and 3)
mw which we describe below. 3 In the equations
and results tables that follow we use P for precision,
R for recall, and Mode P and Mode R where we
calculate precision and recall against the substitute
chosen by the majority of annotators, provided that
there is a majority.
Let H be the set of annotators, T be the set of test
items with 2 or more responses (non NIL or NAME)
and hi be the set of responses for an item i ? T for
annotator h ? H .
For each i ? T we calculate the mode (mi) i.e.
the most frequent response provided that there is a
response more frequent than the others. The set of
items where there is such a mode is referred to as
TM . Let A (and AM ) be the set of items from T
(or TM ) where the system provides at least one sub-
stitute. Let ai : i ? A (or ai : i ? AM ) be the set
of guesses from the system for item i. For each i
we calculate the multiset union (Hi) for all hi for all
h ? H and for each unique type (res) in Hi will
have an associated frequency (freqres) for the num-
ber of times it appears in Hi.
For example: Given an item (id 9999) for happy;a
supposing the annotators had supplied answers as
follows:
annotator responses
1 glad merry
2 glad
3 cheerful glad
4 merry
5 jovial
3The scoring measures are as described in the doc-
ument at http://nlp.cs.swarthmore.edu/semeval/tasks/task10/
task10documentation.pdf released with our trial data.
49
then Hi would be glad glad glad merry merry
cheerful jovial. The res with associated frequencies
would be glad 3 merry 2 cheerful 1 and jovial 1.
best measures This requires the best file produced
by the system which gives as many guesses as the
system believes are fitting, but where the credit
for each correct guess is divided by the number of
guesses. The first guess in the list is taken as the
best guess (bg).
P =
?

|T | (2)
Mode P =

bgi?AM 1 if bg = mi
|AM | (3)
Mode R =

bgi?TM 1 if bg = mi
|TM | (4)
A system is permitted to provide more than one
response, just as the annotators were. They can
do this if they are not sure which response is bet-
ter, however systems will maximise the score if they
guess the most frequent response from the annota-
tors. For P and R the credit is divided by the num-
ber of guesses that a system makes to prevent a sys-
tem simply hedging its bets by providing many re-
sponses. The credit is also divided by the number of
responses from annotators. This gives higher scores
to items with less variation. We want to emphasise
test items with better agreement.
Using the example for happy;a id 9999 above, if
the system?s responses for this item was glad; cheer-
ful the credit for a9999 in the numerator of P and R
would be
3+1
2
7 = .286
For Mode P and Mode R we use the system?s
first guess and compare this to the mode of the anno-
tators responses on items where there was a response
more frequent than the others.
oot measures This allows a system to make up to
10 guesses. The credit for each correct guess is not
divided by the number of guesses. This allows for
the fact that there is a lot of variation for the task and
we only have 5 annotators. With 10 guesses there is
a better chance that the systems find the responses
of these 5 annotators. There is no ordering of the
guesses and the Mode scores give credit where the
mode was found in one of the system?s 10 guesses.

mw measures For this measure, a system must
identify items where the target is part of a multiword
and what the multiword is. The annotators do not all
have linguistics background, they are simply asked
if the target is an integral part of a phrase, and if so
what the phrase is. Sometimes this option is used
by the subjects for paraphrasing a phrase of the sen-
tence, but typically it is used when there is a mul-
tiword. For scoring, a multiword item is one with
a majority vote for the same multiword with more
than 1 annotator identifying the multiword.
Let MW be the subset of T for which there
is such a multiword response from a majority of
at least 2 annotators. Let mwi ? MW be the
multiword identified by majority vote for item i.
Let MWsys be the subset of T for which there is a
multiword response from the system and mwsysi
be a multiword specified by the system for item i.

3.1 Baselines
We produced baselines using WordNet 2.1 (Miller et
al., 1993a) and a number of distributional similarity
measures. For the WordNet best baseline we found
the best ranked synonym using the criteria 1 to 4
below in order. For WordNet oot we found up to 10
synonyms using criteria 1 to 4 in order until 10 were
found:
1. Synonyms from the first synset of the target
word, and ranked with frequency data obtained
from the BNC (Leech, 1992).
2. synonyms from the hypernyms (verbs and
nouns) or closely related classes (adjectives) of
that first synset, ranked with the frequency data.
3. Synonyms from all synsets of the target word,
and ranked using the BNC frequency data.
4. synonyms from the hypernyms (verbs and
nouns) or closely related classes (adjectives) of
all synsets of the target, ranked with the BNC
frequency data.
We also produced best and oot baselines using
the distributional similarity measures l1, jaccard, co-
sine, lin (Lin, 1998) and ?SD (Lee, 1999) 4. We took
the word with the largest similarity (or smallest dis-
tance for ?SD and l1) for best and the top 10 for oot.
For mw detection and identification we used
WordNet to detect if a multiword in WordNet which
includes the target word occurs within a window of
2 words before and 2 words after the target word.
4 Systems
9 teams registered and 8 participated, and two of
these teams (SWAG and IRST) each entered two sys-
tems, we distinguish the first and second systems
with a 1 and 2 suffix respectively.
The systems all used 1 or more predefined inven-
tories. Most used web queries (HIT, MELB, UNT)
or web data (Brants and Franz, 2006) (IRST2, KU,
4We used 0.99 as the parameter for ? for this measure.
SWAG1, SWAG2, USYD, UNT) to obtain counts for
disambiguation, with some using algorithms to de-
rive domain (IRST1) or co-occurrence (TOR) infor-
mation from the BNC. Most systems did not use
sense tagged data for disambiguation though MELB
did use SemCor (Miller et al, 1993b) for filtering in-
frequent synonyms and UNT used a semi-supervised
word sense disambiguation combined with a host of
other techniques, including machine translation en-
gines.
5 Results
In tables 1 to 3 we have ordered systems accord-
ing to R on the best task, and in tables 4 to 6 ac-
cording to R on oot. We show all scores as per-
centages i.e. we multiply the scores in section 3
by 100. In tables 3 and 6 we show results using
the subset of items which were i) NOT identified as
multiwords (NMWT) ii) scored only on non multi-
word substitutes from both annotators and systems
(i.e. no spaces) (NMWS). Unfortunately we do not
have space to show the analysis for the MAN and
RAND subsets here. Please refer to the task website
for these results. 5 We retain the same ordering for
the further analysis tables when we look at subsets
of the data. Although there are further differences
in the systems which would warrant reranking on an
individual analysis, since we combined the subanal-
yses in one table we keep the order as for 1 and 4
respectively for ease of comparison.
There is some variation in rank order of the sys-
tems depending on which measures are used. 6 KU
is highest ranking on R for best. UNT is best at find-
ing the mode, particularly on oot, though it is the
most complicated system exploiting a great many
knowledge sources and components. IRST2 does
well at finding the mode in best. The IRST2 best
R score is lower because it supplied many answers
for each item however it achieves the best R score
on the oot task. The baselines are outperformed by
most systems. The WordNet baseline outperforms
those derived from distributional methods. The dis-
tributional methods, especially lin, show promising
results given that these methods are automatic and

6There is not a big difference between P and R because
systems typically supplied answers for most items.

5.1 Post Hoc Analysis
Choosing a lexical substitute for a given word is
not clear cut and there is inherently variation in the
task. Since it is quite likely that there will be syn-
onyms that the five annotators do not think of we
conducted a post hoc analysis to see if the synonyms
selected by the original annotators were better, on
the whole, than those in the systems responses. We
randomly selected 100 sentences from the subset of
items which had more than 2 single word substitutes,
no NAME responses, and where the target word was

not one of those identified as a multiword (i.e. a ma-
jority vote by 2 or more annotators for the same mul-
tiword as described in section 2). We then mixed the
substitutes from the human annotators with those of
the systems. Three fresh annotators7 were given the
test sentence and asked to categorise the randomly
ordered substitutes as good, reasonable or bad. We
take the majority verdict for each substitute, but if
there is one reasonable and one good verdict, then
we categorise the substitute as reasonable. The per-
centage of substitutes for systems (sys) and original
annotators (origA) categorised as good, reasonable
and bad by the post hoc annotators are shown in ta-
ble 8. We see the substitutes from the humans have
a higher proportion of good or reasonable responses
by the post hoc annotators compared to the substi-
tutes from the systems.
6 Conclusions and Future Directions
We think this task is an interesting one in which to
evaluate automatic approaches of capturing lexical
meaning. There is an inherent variation in the task
because several substitutes may be possible for a
given context. This makes the task hard and scoring
is less straightforward than a task which has fixed
choices. On the other hand, we believe the task taps
into human understanding of word meaning and we
hope that computers that perform well on this task
will have potential in NLP applications. Since a
pre-defined inventory is not used, the task allows us
to compare lexical resources as well as disambigua-
tion techniques without a bias to any predefined in-
ventory. It is possible for those interested in disam-
biguation to focus on this, rather than the choice of
substitutes, by using the union of responses from the
annotators in future experiments.
