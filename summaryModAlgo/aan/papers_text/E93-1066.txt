1 Introduction 
This poster paper describes a full scale two-level mor- 
phological description (Karttunen, 1983, Kosken- 
niemi, 1983) of Turkish word structures. The 
description has been implemented using the PC- 
KIMMO environment (Antworth, 1990) and is based 
on a root word lexicon of about 23,000 roots words. 
Almost all the special cases of and exceptions to 
phonological and morphological rules have been im- 
plemented. 
Turkish is an agglutinative language with word 
structures formed by productive affixations of deriva- 
tional and inflectional suffixes to root words. Turkish 
has finite-state but nevertheless rather complex mor- 
photactics. Morphemes added to a root word or a 
stem can convert he word from a nominal to a ver- 
bal structure or vice-versa, or can create adverbial 
constructs. The surface realizations of morphologi- 
cal constructions are constrained and modified by a 
number of phonetic rules such as vowel harmony. 
2 Two-level description of Turkish 
morphology 
The phonetic rules of contemporary Turkish have 
been encoded using 22 two-level rules while the mor- 
photactics of the agglutinative word structures has 
been encoded as finite-state machines for verbal, 
nominal paradigms. Our lexicons are based on the 
comprehensive word list that we have compiled for 
our spelling checker developed earlier (Solak and 
Oflazer, 1992). We have lexicons for nouns, ad- 
jectives verbs, compound nouns, proper nouns, pro- 
nouns, adverbs, connectives, exclamations, postposi- 
tions, acronyms, technical words, special cases, There 
are total of 18,500 nominal (nouns + adjectives) 
roots and about 2,450 verbal roots. There are about 
100 lexicons for suffixes. 
3 Example Output

mentation (slightly edited for proper orthography):

4 Conclusions 
This poster has presented a summary of the first 
full scale implementation f two-level description of 
Turkish morphology. We have been using this de- 
scription as a morphological parsing module in a 
number of applications like LFG parsing, ATN pars- 
ing and semantics analysis of Turkish sentences.
