1. \ ] ioU~t l~ ~ B~c l~ro~d 
A review of the various means by which 
medica l  knowledge is represented in symbolic 
fo rm \[6,7\] led us to fo rmulate  the \[o\[Iowing 
speetrun~: 
Human.  Machine 
Processible Processible 
Spectrum of 
Medical Knowledge Representation 
Schemes 
The two endpoints of the spectrum represent 
the limiting cases wherein 
knowtedge is difficult, or impossible,  to 
process algorithmically, but transparent 
to medical personnel, e.g. free text; 
or easily processibte algorithmicatty, and 
dil~cuit to process by humans untrained 
in applied mathemat ics  or computer sci- 
ence. e.g. a mat r ix  of Bayesian probabil i -  
t ies, or a semantic network. 
Those attending this conference will be familiar 
with work at both ends of the spectrum, if not in 
medicine, then in other knowledge domains. 
Most will concede  that  the greates t  "successes"  
in the field of exper t  sys tems has  been  ach ieved 
by those working at or near the right-hand end 
of the spectrum; and that progress has been 
most  diff icult to achieve at the Left-hand end of 
the  spect rum.  We conc luded  that .  for the  shor t  
run at least, those successes at the right-hand 
end would prove to be self-limiting - knowledge 
that was not readily accessible to and modifiable 
by the medical community at large could not 
remain in the mainstream of medical practice. 
Similarly, we saw no immediate prospects for a 
breakthrough in the algorithmic understanding 
of free text. though ~npressecL with accomplish- 
ments in the area of natural language access to 
databases \[9, I0\]. 
The di lemma these observations implied led 
us to formulate the following question: 
Co~r~ knowledge ubo=t diseases 6e 
1"e:presen.f.ed in. n fo'mw, f~ha/, is ea.s'i2y

Our initial a t tempts  to answer  this  quest ion led 
us to fo rmulate  yet  another  knowledge 
representat ion scheme, one which operated 
somewhat  o the r ight  of the human-process ib le  
end of the spectrum. Conceding the important 
role of zvo~-ds (rather than text) as conveyers of 
meaning in medicine, we focused on a hierarchi- 
ca/ nominal-attribute model, wherein nominals 
(e lectrons ,  cells, lungs, eta)  were "defined" in 
te rms  of a t t r ibutes  (spin, neoplast ic ,  congested,  
etc.).  Obviously, nomina ls  could be a t t r ibutes  of 
o ther  h igher  level nominals ,  and a t t r ibutes  
could be nomina ls  at a lower level. The principle 
resu l t  of this model  was the observat ion that 
some words had mean ing  only at certain levels - 
electrons could not be congested or neoplastic, 
nor  could Lungs or  cells have spin. While the 
idea of "levels of descr ipt ion" is not new, such 
levels were observed to be both well separated 
and powerful  determiners  of context in medi-

surprisingly, well determined meanings for 
words, diminishing the need for syntax to clarify 
or disambiguate meanin 8. 
Our search for an body of knowledge on 
which to explore certain hypotheses regarding 
such a nominal-attr ibute model in medicine led 
us to regard a familiar but little used resource 
ill medicine in a new light. A corpus of com- 
puter  readable disease deflmtions was seen to 
be a crude instantiat ion of the model. In this 
corpus each disease was given a name (a nomi- 
nal). and defined by its (usually clinical) attri- 
butes - the original motivation for the corpus 
being the standardization of disease nomencla- 
lure. The attr ibutes were written in a tale- 
graphic, but otherwise asily readable style, and 
organized, for each disease, in a relatively stable 
format - a form we have chosen to call s t~c-  
t~d ttzt. 
Superficially. the corpus had but one level 
of description, at t r ibutes of diseases. But each 
disease definition was divided, explicitly, into 
"contexts" (etiology. symptoms . . . . .  lab. x-ray. 
...). and each disease was place in one (or. at 
most  two) "body systems" (whole body. skin ..... 
urogenital . . . .  ). These contexts and systems 
were obviously strong, if imprecise, determiners  
of context. 
Early exper iments  \[3.4\] with this corpus. 
the computer  eadable version of Cto-rtn2 Msd/- 
c,., I, tfo,',nu.~n ~ T~n~o~ (C~IT), 4?h 
Edition \[II\]. explored the selective and associa- 
tive power of the words it employed, and 
confirmed our hypothesis that word use in it was 
both relatively consistent and systematic.  We 
soon realized that the sharpest  est  of the abil- 
ity of words to convey meaning in this context 
was to evaluate the corpus as a knowledge base 
for a "diagnoses program" which would accept a 
description of the patient in the form of a l ist of 
words, such as 'pain. fever, jaundice .... '. The 
specific diagnostic problem we addressed was 
that of formulating a "differential diagnosis ''z 
\[12. 15\]. which included, as alluded to by Scad- 
ding \[21, 5\]. diseases that a physician might not 
othaT~ise think of. but. perhaps,  should think of. 
Important to our attempt to formulate a 
diagnostic prompting program was not only that 
the knowledge base should be readily 
comprehensible, but, if the disease "prompts" 
were to be credible, the "reasoning" by which 
diseases were retrieved and ranked had to be 
equally accessible - a consultative criterion 
noted by Shortlfffe and co-workers \[P~. 23\]. 
In addition, the availability of a knowledge 
base contmning in excess of 3000 disease 
descr ipt ions  has allowed us to study phenomena 
that would be hard to reproduce in the context 
of most "expert systems". ~ For example.

appended to this paper is a t ranscr ipt  of an 
interact ion with RECONSIDER regarding a case 
of methanol poisoning supplied by one of the 
authors (SIN). None of the pat ient findings are 
part icularly specific, but  RECONSIDER places 
the correct  diagnosis in Oth place, and deter- 
mines that  most  of the diseases near the top of 
the differential are "whole body" diseases, a 
group containing most  toxicity diseases. If this 
differential were selected f rom among a few hun- 
dred diseases, or even from a knowledge base of 
toxicity diseases, the result  would he more  open 
to a variety of less favorable interpretat ions.  
Put differently, when one is retrieving f rom such 
a large knowledile base. one is more tolerant 
about the appearance of "false positives" 
(diseases that shouldn't  be there) in the 
interests  of minimizing the number  of "false 
negatives" (diseases that  should be there, but 
are not). 
Finally. RECONSIDER provides a test bed 
for the evaluation of some hypotheses regarding 
the kind of problems encountered represent ing 
and utilizing knowledge about the 'natural ' ,  as 
opposed to 'artificial'. world. Briefly. RECON- 
SIDER benefits from the high degree of struc- 
ture observable in diagnostic medicine, in spite 
of our ignorance in many areas, and the other- 
wise general ly unapprec iated stabil ity and 
specificity of medical language regarding this 
structure.  
2. Zxtmtetattons? 
Non-medical audiences hould be reminded 
of differing expectat ions regarding such mean- 
ing representat ion experiments.  As computer  
scientists, two of us (MST & DDS) "knew" that 
meaning could not be represented  satisfactori ly 
by words alone: words were ambiguous, in gen- 
eral. and, besides, syntax was a partner with 
semantics, and to separate the two was to 
grossly distort the meaning of either. 4 We 
regarded early efforts as potential ly interesting 
from the point of view of statistical linquistics - 
how did words and contexts associate? However. 
the medically trained member  of the initial 
team (MSB) predicted the successful perfor- 
mance  of RECONSIDER once he saw the results 
of  some early word-counting experiments. 
Later. SN, an internist with a background in 
mathematics, anticipated the performance lim- 
iting aspect of RECONSIDER without ever using 
the program! (He predicted that inadequacies 
in the knowledge base would be more  important 
than any shortcomings in the algorithms by 
which descriptions of patients were "matched" 
w~th the descriptions of the diseases.)

-3. An Example of 'S t ruc tured  Text' 
CMIT was designed first for human users, as 
a reference of s tandard disease names  (in book 
form it is about the size of the World Almanac), 
and second for computer  applications. (The 
RECONSIDER-formatted CKIT definition of 
.tet/~yl 0~co/wL, to~c~t~J appears in the appendix 
of this paper.)  The "st ructure"  imposed on CMIT 
definitions is Largely external to the language of 
those definitions. 
First. the entire text of C~T iS organized in the 
aforement ioned noTm~t~-c~tr~b~e form. the 
disease names  being the nominals and the 
descr ipt ions consisting of the attributes of the 
disease, s 
Second. each disease is assigned to one. or pos- 
sibly two, bod~j s 't jsts~s:

g ~s ~s'o ~ e s ~nu~ 
zu~g~i~a~ 
e'n~ocr~ae

Third, each disease is described in po~ts:  
O ~  terms (synonyms x, eponyrns)

Fourth. within each :DaFt, the descending hierar- 
chy of se~.ences, ct~zuaes, and phrases (all 
inferrable from punctuation) are used relatively 
consistently to denote appropr iate "chunks" of 
meaning. 
Thus, in this instance, structured tezt is 
tightly edited prose written in nominal-attribute 
form, employing external markers, and rela- 
tively consistent punctuation,  style, and vocabu- 
Lary. Put differently. CMIT can be "structurally" 
parsed without the need to /ztfer any of the 
semant ics  f rom the text. (Again. a port ion of 
this "parse" is what produces the "display" of 
the deflnLtaon of methy l  - l cotwl ,  toz~c-iZy shown 
in the appendix.)

4. The Current  I~CONSIDKR Implementat ion  
4-. L The Inverted File 
Using abst rac t  syntax to represent  the 
s t ruc ture  in the text. C?41T was scanned and 
"parsed ''~ to produce a sequence of ts~w.~, each 
with the following attr ibutes:  
ordinal position of teem in phrase 
ordinal position of phrase  in clause 
ordinal position of clause in sentence 
ordinal position of sentence in part  
name of part  
disease 
body system(s)  of disease 
Thus. a dict ionary (containing in excess of 
20.000 such terms)  was formed and CM.IT 
"inverted", so that each dictionary entry was fol- 
Lowed by pointers to every occurrence of that 
entry in CMIT. Included with every pointer were 
the seven attributes associated with each 
occur rence  of that term. There are 333.211 
terra occur rences  in CMIT. for an average of 
about  102 terms per  disease, or 79 unique te rms 
per  disease, the difference being te rms that  are 
used more  than once in a given deflnitior~ In 
principle, this "dictionary" could be used to 
reconst ruct  CMIT, as it  r~preswrtts, in aZter,ta- 
t~ve for.7.at, e=actty tlw saw~ ~nformat~rn! 
This Large inverted file allows et~cient 
searching for terms in the text. The searches 
can be (I) constrained to a context (diseases of 
the skin). (2) constra ined to textual  proximity 
(adjacency. or membersh ip  within a clause), or 
(3) constrained to a definition part  (symptoms 
only). 
4.2~ Synonym Dictionary 
A 15.388 te rm "synonym" dictionary a. 
includes words not in CMIT which are synonyms 
of words used in the CMIT definitions and words 
already in CMIT that  are synonyms of each other  
(e.g. prur~tu,s and i tcAg)  These are parti- 
t ioned a_mongst 4.165 "synonym classes" (the 
two or more words within each class are 
synonyms of each other). Search options allow 
searches with or without equiv~dencmg the 
synonyms, and with or without invoking 
hierarchical synonyms. The term "synonym" is 
used generously, as the dictionary is actually 
functioning as a kind of semant ic  net - connect-  
ing words with strong conceptual  Links. It should 
also be noted that RECONSIDER does not 
employ "stemming".  All variants of a term (and 
some phrases,  e.g. abdominal  penn ). including. 
in some cases, mis-speLlings, appear  wittun a sin- 
gle ? 'synonym class". Though we have not proven 
this, it is our opinion that this synonym diction- 
ary is what converts an interesting tool for 
research  into medical term-use, into something

-that functions not unlike an expert  system. 
4.3. Searches 
Searches for a set of te rms can require a 
match on every term. or a match on one or 
more of the terms in the set. In the latter case. 
matches  are scored in a manner  reminiscent of 
techniques used for l i terature and infm-mation 
retrieve/ by Salton. ~parck-Jones and others. 
and in part icu lar  Doszkocs \[8\]. The scoring a/go- 
r i thm is i l lustrated in the next section. 
4. 4. The User- Interface 
RECONSIDER is an interactive user inter- 
face running on top of the inverted file and the 
search algorithms. It accepts terms, search 
modifiers, and requests for one of the two 
matching algorithms, formulates the appropri -  
ate query, searches the inverted files, computes 
the score of the diseases retr ieved (if 
requested),  constructs  a body-system histogram 
(if requested),  ranks the diseases if appropriate, 
and displays any disease definitions elected for 
viewing or browsing by the user. 
5. Per fo rmance  
S.L & Compartsen with two lY~ncet /e  Expert  
When applied Lo the published cases diag- 
nosed by INTERNIST and PIP \[R0.17,16\], 
RECONSIDER produced the correct  diagnosis 
(or diagnoses) at. or near, the top of the disease 
List produced by enterin~ the positive findings 
given Lo these programs \[5\]. (Again. CADUCEUS 
considers 300 diseases from internal medicine, 
and PIP considers 20 diseases featuring edema.) 
While these cases were often complex, a large 
amount  of clinical information was available for 
each patient. 
5.2. Diagnostic Pr~npt in~:  An Example 
We believe that RECONSIDER performs 
better, and much more usefully, at an earl ier 
point in the diagnostic process, at a time prior 
to any extensive patient work-up, when the 
physician's "cognitive span" is widest \[2\]. 
For example, a patient presents with 
findings as noted at the beginning of the appen- 
dix. RECONSIDER begins by prompting for 
terms.  The prefix ~s/is used by the physician- 
user to indicate that the succeeding terms are 
to be searched ~or in either the s'y~npton~s, or 
s~\]rts portions of Lhe disease descriptions. This 
grouping, a union of the two vocabularies, was 
necessitated by the non-consistent usage of 
terms in these contexts. ~The phrase oObdo~r~,,/ 
pmL't will match  (given the RECONSIDER options 
setected to run this case) any co-occurrence of 
these two words (or its synonyms) within a si~gie 
ctause. RECONSIDER responds with the 
synonyms it knows for the terms entered, and 
sThe ~ of terms withe CMIT did not follow t~e ~dioal 
do~rrm as to what was ? ~m;~om, and what w,,, a ssgn. 
the number  of diseases containing one of mor'e 
occurrences  of each of the te rms within the ss /  
context. The response =bdo.tinaL pain\[ 191+80\] 
indicates that the pah" abdom~n~ pen occurs  in 
191 diseases and that 80 additional diseases 
have been retr ieved by the synonyms for ~bdom- 
paL-t, namely ccL/c\[3~\], csL~ck~/~16\], end 
pWut /n  abdom4~48\] .  The fact that  3.5?15+48 
exceeds 80. and 191+35+18+48 exceeds 
191+180, indicates that  some d iseue  definitions 
contain more than one te rm from this synonym 
class. 
The score (a measure of selectivity) for 
abdom~n~ p~n is 
0.917 = 1 - (271/3262)  
where 271 is the number  of "disease 
occurrences"  of abdomma~ p~,  and 3252 is the 
total nurnbar of diseases in CMIT. A disease's 
score is the sum of the scores of the te rms its 
descript ion matched. 
Most physicians would probably conclude 
that  the observation that the patienL smoked 
was not relevant to the patient's illness, but  the 
te rm smo~ was entered here to show its obvi- 
ous effect on the disease List (it brings n~.ott~ur, 
to=/?/~ and ~g ~pende.ce ,  ma=-/h~m~ 
nearer  to the top, partly because it is so "seLec- 
tive"). It is not clear which 'part '  of the disease 
descr ipt ions the te rm ~wlo~g will be found in. 
so its search context is al l / .  and the same deci- 
sion is made with respect  o =e/dos.iv. An/on gap 
~/dos /8  is not used in C~\]T, so we enter  the 
more  genera/  form. I? Entering swto~lk~g in the 
a~/context  has the disadvantage that  it brings 
in a reference to smoky, which is used as an 
adjective. 
The histogram displays the body system 
frequencies for the diseases near the top of the 
disease list (the top 4~, was selected by the user 
to include about the first "screen's  worth" of the 
disease List - 8?9 diseases containing one or 
more  of the te rms entered, or  their synonyms). 
A physic ian-user viewing the first screen- 
full of this ~st (the port ion shown in the appen- 
dix) would next formulate a strategy for resolv- 
ing it, assuming the diagnosis was still noL 
immediately apparent.  A methodical approach 
would note first that no disease matched all five 
entries (as no disease has a score of 4.738). 
Similarly, diseases #I, #2. and #3 would be ruled 
out by asking the patient appropr iate questions. 
(If the patient were f rom Matin County, here in 
the Bay Area. we might focus our initial aLLen- 
Lion on #2, rn~.sh~'oont, toe'S.city, in response to

"~owledge that is not available tu RECON- 
SIDER.) Disease #4, ec to~p~,  raises a more 
interesting issue. RECONSIDER does not have a 
model  of gender  (or of anyth ing  else), so a 
disease that occurs dur ing pregnancy is not 
automatically ruled out when the patient is 
male.  WhAle unders tandab ly  d is t ract ing  at first.

s"It ?o~ reveals  that  it is usual ly  accompan ied  
by a r ich complex of symptoms, so while it can  
not  be ru led out at  th is  point, it becomes  
ext remely  unlikely. Since the pat ient  is not an 
alcoholic, the definit ion of d i sease  #6, rn.ethTjt

occupat iona l  exposure (perhaps  percutaneous  
or respkatory ) .  Once cons idered,  an appropr i -

substance in the  body. 
8. /k~l-Umr Experience 
We have not permi t ted  RECONSIDER to be 
used '~iva" in a clinical context. In addition to 
the fact that evaluation of the program is not 
complete ,  the knowledge base is known to be out  
of date.  Nonethe less  ince we have been  able to 
move RECONSIDER to the MIS-UCSF VAX 11/750 
runn ing  UNIX~ (Berkeley 4.1) s tudents ,  post-  
doctora l  fellows and some facul ty  have been able 
to use the program. The initial reaction usually 
consists of the following three observations: (I) 
"Why is that disease there?" (sometimes it's 
there  Legitimately, and somet imes  not), (2) "How 
does such a dumb program do so well?" (refer- 
ring to RECONSIDER's lack of evident reasoning 
power), and (3) "What I need  to be able to do now 
is ..." (1111 in your favorite interactive- 
knowledge-base user-feature). 
We to lerate  the probiem alluded to by ques- 
tion (I) because it is more  important, at this 
stage of development, not to miss important 
diseases, and because it is easier for a 
physician-user to reject totally inappropriate 
diseases than it is for the program to do so. 
Question (2) alludes to the point ra ised by the 
title of this paper. RECONSIDER can only be 
considered an "expert"  (if at all) because its 
knowledge base is so Large (relative to what a 
phys ic ian can keep readi ly  avai lable in his or her  
head), and because of its performance. It is 
obviously not  like a human "expert"  un the way it 
a~'~ves at the disease list. And question (3) we 
take to be a comphment  that reveals, among 
other things, that occasionally the utility of 
RECONSIDER is iu~uted not by the knowledge it 
eonteuns, but by the means  we currently have of 
accessing it through the narrow window of a 23- 
line CRT terminal. 
Question (1) deserves  fu r ther  comment .  
The author (MST) has observed  considerable 
user-discomfort caused by CMIT hexing diseases 
from several body systems near the top of a 
eUN1X is a produc~ of Ben Telephone Laboratories, ~nc. 
sor ted  disease list. Apparently,  the  cognit ive 
d issonance is usual ly  avoided by th ink ing about  
d iseases  by system,  an the discomfort can be 
rel ieved by rest r ic t ing the  search  (and thus  the 
sor ted  list) to a single body sys tem.  The prob- 
lem with the la t ter  pract ice  is that  the  pre l im-  
inary results of our evaluation reveals that con- 
textless (0~/searches) are the most e~Lcacious. 
on average. AS this is also the opposite of the 
behavior predicted by our model of context in a 
norruna/-attribute knowled4\[e base. further study 
is suggested.  In any case, it  may prove neces- 
sary to re-des ign the user - in tor face  to accomo-  
date some users '  need to view deseases  by sys-  
tem, within a contextless search. 
7. Evaluation 
A formal evaluation of RECONSIDER on i00 
ser ial  admiss ions  to a te r tmry  care  medica l  
ward. is in p rogress  (and will be repor ted  else- 
where),  but  the pre l im/nary  resu l t s  are both  
encouraging and in terest ing .  They  are 
encourag ing  because  the  cor rec t  d iagnoses  is 
inc luded so often in the  first f rame or two (and 
usual ly higher),  and in teres t ing  because  the 
di f ference between d iagnost ic  p rograms,  and 
d iagnost ic  p~rn4~g programs is made quite 
clear, The fo rmer  have a very  specif ic goal. and  
it is easy to tell whether  it is reached or not. A 
prompt ing  program is eva luated  against a 
dif ferent s tandard;  not  whether  it is cor rec t  but  
whether  it is ha lp fu i  And judging whether  some-  
thing is helpful or not may be a subtle matter. 
If the correct diagnosis is included h~h on the 
List, the performance can be given a hiKh score. 
But if, instead, a l isted disease closely related to 
the correct one has the result of directing the 
physician's attention to the correct body sys- 
tem, and finally the  cor rec t  diagnosis,  how is 
this to be scored? 
8. Suspected  \[~mitat/ons: 
8.1. The \]Qaowtedge 
As has been the exper ience  with s imi lar  
projects, computer processing subjects 
"knowledge" to a harsh  and unyie ld ing l~ht .  We 
anticipate that a half a man-year of "tuning" 
would significantly improve RECONSIDEEs per- 
fo rmance,  but  that  the  next and much more  
ser ious Limitation will be the  quality, uni formity,  
completeness ,  and t imel iness  of CMIT and the 
synonym dictionary. Given the opportunity to 
rewrite CMIT (and continue to do so on an on- 
going basis), or in t roduc ing A\] techn iques  to 
RECONSIDER (we have rece ived many sugges- 
tions), we would choose the former .  
8.2, Other l Jrnit~Uol~ 
Our experience to date has taught us that, 
in this context, negatives are ~nportant. Terms 
such  as fe~r  u~b.se~tt are teated  as i f /e-vet  were 
a posit ive finding: while not fatal, such retr ievals  
inc rease  the number  of false posit ives. Also 
users  often wish to search using "rule-out",  e.g. 
el i rmnate all d i seases  f rom cons iderat ion  
128 
conta in ing  a cer ta in  te rm.  or te rms.  Especial ly 
t r icky would be in teract ions  between these  two 
uses  of negation.  
On a more  global level. CMITs homogeniza-  
t ion of d iseases  cont r ibutes  to confus ion and 
loss of information.  Congestive hear t  fai lure is 
l isted as a d isease under  ~r( .  fa~,ui'e, cov~ss- 
tt~e. as a symptom under  ~ar t .  AMoe~tm,~mye. 
~e- -e .  as a sign under  Har t ,  AV/m,-tT~pA V,
/mm-t. f~tv  0kge~rt  and ~ s ta~a '~.  
,fu.bv,dvuZar, and as a complication in, for exam- 
pie. t r~pznaso~a~s, ~awm~c~m. And to il lus- 
t ra te  the s t ress  on the process  of a t tempt ing  to 
fo rm a closed set  of synonyms,  the symptoms 
and signs of c0n~es~e ~m'~ ~ s  are 
descr ibed at various points as in cm-dio~.,~o- 
pa?A!@, but the phrase  conges~bue heart f ~  
does not  occur  in that  descr ipt ion.  
9. Futuure Imp{ementaU~um 
Given an opportun i ty  to re-brnplement CMIT. 
we would re t reat  h-ore our  original not ion that  it 
should not be modified (so as to prove that 
s t ruc tured  text  could be used, intact,  as a 
knowledge base). Rather  we would mainta In  the  
inver ted  files dynamical ly,  in a relat ional  data-  
base. so as to faci l itate modif ications, and 
exper iments  with a l ternat ive knowledge 
representat ions  and retr ieval  techn iques .  
Specifically. we would invest igate the diff iculty 
of re-writIng CM1T to improve the  quality and 
t imel iness  of the informat ion it contained,  to 
use a more  s tandard  model  of d isease nomenc la -  
ture  \[ 1\]. to evaluate a l ternat ive ways of handl ing 
negat ion  (such as 2m~ug~e -bsent ) .  and the  
allow users  to specify necess /~ (a term m.usf 
occur, or not occur, In a disease description for 
it to be retr ieved).  
RECONSIDER cur rent ly  requires some 20 
MB o{ disk space. A dynamically revisable ver- 
sion would require at least twice that. making 
RECONSIDER a little Like an orphan e lephant  in 
already pressed medical computing environ- 
ments. A "production" version of RECONSIDER 
might fit in 15 MB, leaving two alternatives for 
the future: running RECONSIDER on the large 
address-space micro-based systems now avail.- 
able with large hard disks, or making it available 
on a network. We are toot~n~ into both possibil i- 
t ies. 
10. Conc lumons  
In the  context  of medical  diagnoses, and 
perhaps  in o ther  appt icat ion areas.  "s t ruc tured  
text", as defined here, has been neglected as a 
means  of representin 8 information in a form 
accessible to both humans  and algorithms. If as 
Minsky has put it. "For a program, being smart 
is knowing a tot.", then carefulty edited and con- 
structed natural language text, available in 
computer-readable form, may facilitate the pro- 
cess by which programs come to "know a lot" 
and continue to "know a tot" as the knowledge 
evolves over t ime. 
We conc lude by not ing that  u l t imate ly  tile 
usefu lness  of d iagnost ic  aids such  as RECON- 
SIDER. must  await the verd ict  of users .  If the 
cost  and bother  of the i r  use  is less than  the 
benef i t  they  are found to provide, we can expect  
them to make  the i r  way Into clinical pract ice.  
Up unti l  the  present  thne.  no diagnost ic  suppor t  
program seems to have accomplished t~s.
