Abstract 
We are concerned with dependency- 
oriented morphosyntactic parsing of run- 
ning text. While a parsing grammar should 
avoid introducing structurally unresolvable 
distinctions in order to optimise on the ac- 
curacy of the parser, it also is beneficial 
for the grammarian to have as expressive a 
structural representation available as possi- 
ble. In a reductionistic parsing system this 
policy may result in considerable ambigu- 
ity in the input; however, even massive am- 
biguity can be tackled efficiently with an 
accurate parsing description and effective 
parsing technology. 
1 Introduction 
In this paper we are concerned with grammar-based 
surface-syntactic analysis of running text. Morpho- 
logical and syntactic analysis is here based on the 
use of tags  that express surface-syntactic relations 
between functional categories such as Subject, Mod- 
ifier, Main verb etc.; consider the following simple 
example: 
I PRON ~SUBJECT 
see  V PRES @MAINVERB 
a ART QDET>N 
bird N ~OBJECT

*The development of ENGCG was supported by 
TEKES, the Finnish Technological Development Center, 
and a part of the work on Finite-state syntax has been 
supported by the Academy of Finland. 
In this type of analysis, each word gets a mor- 
phosyntactic analysis I. 
The present work is closely connected with two 
parsing formalisms, Constraint Grammar  \[Karls- 
son, 1990; Karlsson et aI., 1991; Voutilainen et aI., 
1992; Karlsson et aI., 1993\] and Finlte-state syn- 
tax as advocated by \[Koskenniemi, 1990; Tapanai- 
nen, 1991; Koskenniemi et al, 1992\]. The Con- 
straint Grammar parser of English is a sequential 
modular system that assigns a shallow surface-true 
dependency-oriented functional analysis on running 
text, annotating each word with morphological and 
syntactic tags. The finite-state parser assigns a sim- 
ilar type of analysis, but it operates on all levels of 
ambiguity 2 in parallel rather than sequentially, en- 
abling the grammarian to refer to all levels of struc- 
tural description in a single uniform rule component. 
ENGCG,  a wide-coverage English Constraint 
Grammar and lexicon, was written 1989-1992, and 
the system is currently available 3. The Constraint 
Grammar framework was proposed by Fred Karls- 
son, and the English Constraint Grammar  was de- 
veloped by Afro Voutilainen (lexicon, morphological 
disambiguation), Juha Heikkil~i (lexicon) and Arto 
Anttila (syntax). There are a few implementations 
lit consists of a base form, a morphological reading 
- part-of-speech, inflectional and other morphosyntactic 
features - and a syntactic-functional t g, flanked by '@'.

3The ENGCG parser can currently be tested 
automatically via E-mail by sending texts of up 
to 300 words to engcg@ling.Helsinki.FI. The re- 
ply will contain the analysis as well as informa- 
tion on usage and availability. Questions can also 
be directly sent to avoutila@ling.Helsinki.FI or to

of the parser, and the latest, written in C by Pasi 
Tapanainen, analyses more than 1000 words per sec- 
ond on a Sun SparcStationl0, using a disambiguation 
grammar of some 1300 constraints. 
Intensive work within the finite-state framework 
was started by Tapanainen \[1991\] in 1990, and an op- 
erational parser was in existence the year after. The 
first nontrivial finite-state descriptions \[Koskenniemi 
etal., 1992\] were written by Voutilainen 1991-1992, 
and currently he is working on a comprehensive En- 
glish grammar which is expected to reach a consider- 
able degree of maturity by the end of 1994. Much of 
this emerging work is based on the ENGCG descrip- 
tion, (e.g. the ENGTWOL lexicon is used as such); 
however, the design of the grammar has changed con- 
siderably, as will be seen below. 
We have two main theses. Firstly, knowledge- 
based reductionistic grammatical nalysis will be fa- 
cilitated rather than hindered by the introduction 
of (new) linguistically motivated and structurally 
resolvable distinctions into the parsing scheme, al- 
though this policy will increase the amount of am- 
biguity in the parser's input. Secondly, the amount 
of ambiguity in the input does not predict he speed 
of analysis, so introduction of new ambiguities in the 
input is not necessarily something to be avoided. 
Next, we present some observations about the 
ENGCG parser: the linguistic description would be- 
come more economic and accurate if all levels of 
structural description were available at the outset of 
reductionistic parsing (or disambiguation f alterna- 
tive readings). In Section 3 we report on some early 
experiments with finite-state parsing. In Section 4 
we sketch a more satisfactory functional dependency- 
oriented escription. A more expressive representa- 
tion implies more ambiguity in the input; in Section 5 
it is shown, however, that even massive ambiguity 
need be no major problem for the parser. 
2 Constraint Grammar of English 
A large-scale description has been written within the 
Constraint Grammar (CG) framework. CG parsing 
consists of the following sequential modules: 
? Preprocessing and morphological nalysis 
? Disambiguation of morphological (e.g. part-of- 
speech) ambiguities 
? Mapping of syntactic functions onto morpholog- 
ical categories 
? Disambiguation f syntactic functions 
Here we shall be concerned only with disambigua- 
tion of morphological mbiguities - this module, 
along with the TWOL-style morphological descrip- 
tion ENGTWOL, is the most mature part of the 
ENGCG system. 
The morphological description is based on \[Quirk 
et al, 1985\]. For each word, a base form, a part of 
speech as well as inflectional and also derivational 
tags are provided, e.g. 
("<*i>" 
("i" <*> ABBR NOM SG) 
("i" <*> <NonMod> PRON PERS NOM SGI)) 
("<see>" 
("see" <SVO> V SUBJUNCTIVE VFIN) 
("see" <SVO> V IMP VFIN) 
("see" <SVO> Y INF) 
("see" <SVO> V PRES -SG3 VFIN)) 
(,,<~>,, 
("a" <Indef> DET CENTRAL ART SG)) 
("<bird>" 
("bird" <SV> V SUBJUNCTIVE VFIN) 
("bird" <SV> V IMP VFIN) 
("bird" <SV> V INF) 
("bird" <SV> V PRES -SG3 VFIN) 
("bird" S NOM SG)) 
(,,<$.>,') 
Ambiguities due to part of speech and minor cat- 
egories are common in English - on an average, the 
ENGTWOL analyser furnishes each word with two 
readings. The task of the morphological disambiguev 
tor is certainly a nontrivial one. 
The disambiguator uses a hand-written constraint 
grammar. Here, we will not go into the technicalities 
of the CG rule formalism; suffice it to say that each 
constraint - presently some 1,300 in all - expresses a 
partial paraphrase ofsome thirty more general gram- 
mar statements, typically in the form of negative re- 
strictions. - For instance, a constraint might reject 
verb readings in an ambiguous morphological nal- 
ysis as contextually illegitimate if the immediately 
preceding word is an unambiguous determiner. This 
can be regarded as a roundabout partial statement 
about the form of a noun phrase: a determiner is fol- 
lowed by a premodifier or a noun phrase head, so all 
morphological readings that cannot act as nominal 
heads or premodifiers are to be discarded. 
Here is the disambiguated representation f the 
sentence: 
("<*i>" 
("i" <*> <NonMod> PRON PERS NOM SGI)) 
("<see>" 
("see" <SVO> V PRES -SG3 VFIN)) 
("<a>" 
("a" <Indef> DET CENTRAL ART SG)) 
( *'<bird>" 
("bird" N NOM SG)) 
(,,<$.>,,) 
Overall, the morphological disambiguator has a 
very attractive performance. While the best known 
competitors - typically based on statistical methods 
(see e.g. \[Garside tal., 1987; Church, 1988\]) - make 
a misprediction about part of speech in up to 5% of 
all words, the ENGCG disambiguator makes a false 
prediction only in up to 0.3% of all cases \[Vouti- 
lainen, 1993\]. So far, ENGCG has been used in a 
395 
large-scale information management system (an ES- 
PRIT II project called SIMPR: Structured Informa. 
lion Management: Processing and Relrieval). Cur- 
rently ENGCG is also used for tagging the Bank of 
English, a 200-million word corpus established by 
the COBUILD team in Birmingham, England; the 
tagged corpus will become accessible to the research 
community. 
What makes ENGCG interesting for the present 
discussion is the fact that the constraints are es- 
sentially partial expressions of the distribution of 
functional-syntactic categories. In other words, the 
generalisations underlying the disambiguation con- 
straints pertain to a higher level of description than 
is explicitly coded in the input representation. 
The high number and also the complexity of most 
of the constraints mainly results from the fact that 
direct reference to functional categories i not pos- 
sible in the constraint grammar because syntactic 
functions are systematically introduced only after 
morphological disambiguation has become disacti- 
vated. Also explicit information about sentence- 
internal clause boundaries i missing, so a constraint, 
usually about clause-internal relations, has to ascer- 
tain that the words and features referred to are in 
the same clause - again in a roundabout and usually 
partial fashion. 
Indeed, it is argued in \[Voutilainen, 1993\] that if 
direct reference to all appropriate categories were 
possible, most or all of part-of-speech disambiguation 
would be a mere side-effect of genuine functional- 
syntactic analysis. In other words, it seems that the 
availability of a more expressive grammatical repre- 
sentation would make part-of-speech analysis easier, 
even though the amount of ambiguity would increase 
at the outset. 
The ENGCG disambiguator avoids risky predic- 
tions; some 3-6~ of all words remain partly am- 
biguous after part-of-speech disambiguation. Also 
most of these remaining ambiguities appear struc- 
turally resolvable. The reason why these ambiguities 
are not resolved by the ENGCG disambiguator is 
that the expression of the pertinent grammar rules 
as constraints, without direct reference to syntactic- 
function labels and clause boundaries, becomes pro- 
hibitively difficult. Our hypothesis that also most 
of the remaining part-of-speech ambiguities could be 
resolved if also clause boundary and syntactic de- 
scriptors were present in the input, even though this 
would imply more ambiguity at the outset of parsing. 
3 F i r s t  exper iences  w i th  F in i te -S ta te  
syntax  
Finite-state syntax, as originally proposed by Kos- 
kenniemi, s an emerging framework that has been 
used in lexicon-based reductionistic parsing. Some 
nontrivial English grammars of some 150-200 rules 
have been written recently. The main improvements 
are the following. 
? All three types of structural ambiguity- mor- 
phological, clause boundary, and syntactic - are pre- 
sented in parallel. No separate, potentially sequen- 
tially applied subgrammars formorphological disam- 
biguation, clause boundary determination, or syntax 
proper, are needed - one uniform rule component 
will suffice for expressing the various aspects of the 
grammar. In this setting, therefore, a genuine test 
of the justification of three separate types of gram- 
mar is feasible: for instance, it is possible to test, 
whether morphological disambiguation is reducible 
to essentially syntactic-functional grammar. 
? The internal representation f the sentence is 
more distinctive. The FS parser represents each 
sentence reading separately, whereas the CG parser 
only distinguishes between alternative word read- 
ings. Therefore the FS rules need not concern them- 
selves with more than one unambiguous, though po- 
tentially unacceptable, sentence reading at a time, 
and this improves parsing accuracy. 
? The rule formalism is more expressive and flexi- 
ble than in CG; for instance, the full power of regular 
expressions i  available. The most useful kind of rule 
appears to be the impl icat ion rule; consider the 
following (somewhat simplified) rule about the dis- 
tribution of the subject in a finite clause: 
Subject => 
_ .. F inVerbCha in ,  
F inAux  . . . . .  NonF inMainVerb  . . .  qUEST ION;  
It reads: 'A finite clause subject (a constant de- 
fined as a regular expression elsewhere in the gram- 
mar) occurs before a finite verb chain in the same 
clause ('..'), or it occurs between a finite auxiliary 
and a nonfinite main verb in the same clause, and 
the sentence nds in a question mark.' - If a sen-  
tence  reading contains a sequence of tags that is ac- 
cepted by the regular expression Subject and that is 
not legitimated by the contexts, the sentence read- 
ing is discarded; otherwise it survives the evaluation, 
perhaps to be discarded by some other grammar rule. 
hnplication rules express distributions in a 
straightforward, positive fashion, and usually they 
are very compact: several dozens of CG rules that 
express bits and pieces of the same grammatical phe- 
nomenon can usually be expressed with one or two 
transparent finite-state rules. 
? The CG syntax was somewhat shallow. The 
difference between finite and non-finite clauses was 
mostly left implicit, and the functional description 
was not extended to clausal constructions, which also 
can serve e.g. as subjects and objects. In contrast, 
even the earlier FS grammars did distinguish be- 
tween finite and non-finite constructions, although 
the functional description of these categories was still 
lacking in several respects. Still, even this modest 
enrichment of the grammatical representation made 
it easier to state distributional generalisations, al-
396 
though much still remained hard to express, e.g. co- 
ordination of formally different but functionally sim- 
ilar categories. 
3.1 A pilot exper iment 
To test whether the addition of clause boundary 
and functional-syntactic information made morpho- 
logical disambiguation easier, a finite-state grammar 
consisting of some 200 syntactic rules \[Koskenniemi 
et al, 1992\] was written, and a test text 4 was se- 
lected. The objective was to see, whether those 
morphological mbiguities that are too hard for the 
ENGCG disambiguator to resolve can be resolved 
if a more expressive grammatical description (and a 
more powerful parsing formalism) is used. 
Writing a text-generic omprehensive parsing 
grammar of a maturity comparable to the ENGCG 
description would have taken too much time to be 
practical for this pilot test. While most of the gram- 
mar rules were about relatively frequently occur- 
ring constructions, e.g. about the structure of the 
finite verb chain or of prepositional phrases, some 
of the rules were obviously 'inspired' by the test 
text: the test grammar is more comprehensive on
the structural phenomena of the test text than on 
texts in general. However, all proposed rules were 
carefully tested against various corpora, e.g. a man- 
ually tagged collection of some 2,000 sentences taken 
from \[Quirk et al, 1985\], as well as large untagged 
corpora, in order to ascertain the generality of the 
proposed rules. 
Thus the resulting rammar was 'optimised' in the 
sense that all syntactic structures of the text were 
described in the grammar, but not in the sense that 
the rules would have been true of the test text only. 
The test data was first analysed with the ENGCG 
disambiguator. Out of the 1,400 words, 43 remained 
ambiguous due to morphological category, and no 
misanalyses were made. Then the analysed ata 
was enriched with the more' expressive finite-state 
syntactic description, i.e. with new ambiguities, and 
this data was then analysed with the finite-state 
parser. After finite-state parsing, only 3 words re- 
mained morphologically ambiguous, with no mis- 
analyses. Thus the introduction of more descriptive 
elements into the sentence representations made it 
possible to safely resolve almost all of the remaining 
43 morphological mbiguities. 
This experiment suggests the usefulness of hav- 
ing available as much structural information as pos- 
sible, although undoubtedly some of the additional 
precision resulted from a more optimal internal rep- 
resentation of the input sentence and from a more 
expressive rule formalism. Overall, these results 
seem to contradict certain doubts voiced \[Sampson, 
1987; Church, 1992\] about the usefulness of syntac- 
tic knowledge in e.g. part-of-speech disambiguation. 
4An article from The New Grolier Electronic Encyclo- 
pedia, consisting of some 1,400 words 
Part-of-speech disambiguation is essentially syntac- 
tic in nature; at least current methods based on lexi- 
cal probabilities provide a less reliable approximation 
of correct part-of-speech tagging. 
4 A new tagg ing  scheme 
The above observations suggest that grammar-based 
analysis of running text is a viable enterprise - not 
only academically, but even for practical applica- 
tions. A description that on the one hand avoids 
introducing systematic structurally unresolvable am- 
biguities, and, on the other, provides an expressive 
structural description, will, together with a care- 
ful and detailed lexicography and grammar-writing, 
make for a robust and very accurate parsing system. 
The main remaining problem is the shortcomings 
in the expressiveness of the grammatical representa- 
tion. The descriptions were somewhat too shallow 
for conveniently making functional generalisations 
at higher levels of abstraction; this holds especially 
for the functional description of non-finite and finite 
clauses. 
This became clear also in connection with the ex- 
periment reported in the previous ection: although 
the number of remaining morphological mbiguities 
was only three, the number of remaining syntactic 
ambiguities was considerably higher: of the 64 sen- 
tences, 48 (75%) received a single syntactic analy- 
sis, 13 sentences (20%) received two analyses, one 
sentence received three analyses, and two sentences 
received four analyses. 
Here, we sketch a more satisfying notation that 
has already been manually applied on some 20,000 
words of running text from various genres as well 
as on some 2,000 test sentences from a large gram- 
mar \[Quirk et al, 1985\]. Together, these test cor- 
pora serve as a first approximation f the inventory 
of syntactic structures in written English, and they 
can be conveniently used in the validation of the new 
grammar under development.

syntactic tags:

Main clause 
Non-finite verbal fragment 
n-head Nominal f ragment 
a-head Adverb ia l  f ragment 
This list represents the tags in a somewhat ab- 
stract fashion. Our description also employs a few 
notational conventions. 
Firstly, the notation makes an explicit difference 
between two kinds of clause: the finite and the non- 
finite. 
A finite clause typically contains (i) a verb chain, 
one or more in length, one of which is a finite verb, 
and (ii) a varying number of nominal and adver- 
bial constructs. Verbs and nominal heads in a fi- 
nite clause are indicated with a tag written in the 
upper case, e.g. Sam/@SUBJ was/@MV a/@>N 
man/@SC. 
A verb chain in a non-finite clause, on the other 
hand, contains only non-finite verbs. Verbs and nom- 
inal heads in a non-finite clause are indicated with a 
tag written in the lower case, e.g. To/@auz be/@mv 
or/@CC not/@ADVL fo/@aux be/@mv. 
While a distinction is made between the upper and 
the lower case in the description of verbs and nominal 
heads, no such distinction is made in the description 
of other categories, which are all furnished with tags 
in the upper case, of. or/@CC not/@ADVL. 
Secondly, the notation accounts both for the inter- 
nal structure of clausal units and for their function in 
their matrix clause. Usually, all tags start with the 
'@' sign, but those tags that indicate the function of 
a clausal unit rather than its internal structure nd 
with the '~ '  sign. The function tag of a clause is at- 
tached to the main verb of the clause, so main verbs 
always get two tags instead of the ordinary one tag. 
An example is in order: 
How @ADVL 
to  @aux 
wr i te  @mv mainc@ 
books @obj 
Here write is a main verb in a non-finite clause 
(@mr), and the non-finite clause itself acts as an in- 
dependent non-finite clause (mainc@). 
4.2 Sample  analyses  
Next, we examine the tagging scheme with some con- 
crete examples. Note, however, that most morpho- 
logical tags are left out in these examples; only a 
part-of-speech tag is given. Consider the following 
analysis: 
@0 
smoking PCP1 @mv SUBJ@ Q 
c igaret tes  N Qobj @ 
inspires V @MV MAINC@ @ 
the DET @>N @ 
fat A @>N @ 
butcher ' s  N @>N @ 
wife N @OBJ @ 
and CC @CC @ 
daughters  N @OBJ @ 
FULLSTOP @@ 
The boundary markers '@@', '~' ,  '@/', '@<' and 
'@>' indicate a sentence boundary, a plain word 
boundary, an iterative clause boundary, the begin- 
ning, and the end, of a centre embedding, respec- 
tively. 
As in ENGCG, also here all words get a function 
tag. Smoking is a main verb in a non-finite con- 
struction (hence the lower case tag @my); cigarette 
is an object in a non-finite construction; inspires i a 
main verb in a finite construction (hence the upper 
case tag @MV), and so on. 
Main verbs also get a second tag that indicates the 
function of the verbal construction. The non-finite 
verbal construction Smoking cigarettes is a subject 
in a finite clause, hence the tag SUB J@ for Smok- 
ing. The finite clause is a main clause, hence the tag 
MAINC@ for inspires, the main verb of the finite 
clause. 
The syntactic tags avoid telling what can be eas- 
ily inferred from the context. For instance, the tag 
@>N indicates that the word is a determiner or a 
premodifier of a nominal. A more detailed classifica- 
tion can be achieved by consulting the morphological 
codes in the same morphological reading, so from the 
combination DET @>N we may deduce that the is 
a determiner of a nominal in the right-hand context; 
from the combination A @>N we may deduce that 
fat is an adjectival premodifier of a nominal, and so 
forth. 
The notation avoids introducing structurally un- 
resolvable distinctions. Consider the analysis of fat. 
The syntactic tag @>N indicates that the word is a 
premodifier of a nominal, and the head is to the right 
- either it is the nominal head of the noun phrase, 
or otherwise it is another nominal premodifier in be- 
tween. In other words, the tag @>N accounts for 
both of the following bracketings: 
\[\[fat butcher's\] wife\] 
\[ \[fat \[butcher' s wife\] 
Note also that coordination often introduces un- 
resolvable ambiguities. On structural criteria, it is 
398 
impossible to determine, for instance, whether fat 
modifies the coordinated aughters as well in the fat 
butcher's wife and daughters. Our notation keeps 
also this kind of ambiguity covert, which helps to 
keep the amount of ambiguity within reasonable lim- 
its. 
In our description, the syntactic function is car- 
ried by the coordinates rather than by the coordi- 
nator - hence the object function tags on both wife 
and daughters rather than on and. An alternative 
convention would be the functional abelling of the 
conjunction. The difference appears to be merely 
notational. 
A distinction is made between finite and non-finite 
constructions. As shown above, non-finiteness i  ex- 
pressed with lower case tags, and finite (and other) 
constructions are expressed with upper case tags. 
This kind of splitup makes the grammarian's task 
easier. For instance, the grammarian might wish 
to state that a finite clause contains maximally one 
potentially coordinated subject. Now if potential 
subjects in non-finite clauses could not be treated 
separately, it would be more difficult to express the 
grammar statement as a rule because xtra checks for 
the existence of subjects of non-finite constructions 
would have to be incorp6rated in the rule as well, at 
a considerable cost to transparency and perhaps also 
to generality. Witness the following sample analysis: 
@@ 
Henry g @SUBJ @ 
dislikes V @MV MAINC@ @

FULLSTOP @@ 
Apparently, there are two simplex subjects in the 
same clause; what makes them acceptable is that 
they have different verbal regents: Henry is a subject 
in a finite clause, with dislikes as the main verb, while 
her occurs in a non-finite clausal construction, with 
leaving as the main verb. 
With regard to the description of so early in the 
above sentence, the present description makes no 
commitments a to whether the adverbial attaches to 
dislikes or leaving - in the notational system, there 
is no separate tag for adverbials in non-finite con- 
structions. The resolution of adverbial attachment 
often is structurally unresolvable, so our description 
of these distinctions is rather shallow. 
Also finite clauses can have a nominal functions. 
Consider the following sample.

Here What makes them acceptable acts as a subject 
in a finite clause, and that they have different verbal 
regents acts as a subject complement. - Clauses in a 
dependent role are always subordinate clauses that 
typically have a more fixed word order than main 
clauses. Thus clause-function tags like SC@ can also 
be used in fixing clause-internal structure. 
Another advantage of the introduction of clause- 
function tags is that restricting the distribution of 
clauses becomes more straightforward. If, for in- 
stance, a clause is described as a postmodifying 
clause, then it has to follow something to postmodify; 
if a clause is described as a subject, then it should 
also have a predicate, and so on. More generally: 
previous grammars contained some rules explicitly 
about clause boundary markers, for instance: 
e /  => 
VFIN . . . . .  VFIN; 
In contrast, the grammar currently under develop- 
ment contains no rules of this type. Clause boundary 
determination is likely to be reducible to functional 
syntax, much as is the case with morphological dis- 
ambiguation. This new uniformity in the grammar 
is a consequence of the enrichment of the description 
with the functional account of clauses. 
Also less frequent of 'basic' word orders can be con- 
veniently accounted for with the present descriptive 
apparatus. For instance, in the following sentence 
there is a 'deferred' preposition; here the comple- 
ment is to the left of the preposition.

Here, and Tolstoy her greatest novelist is granted 
a clause status, as indicated by the presence of the 
iterative clause boundary marker '@/'. 
Note that clausal constructions without a main 
verb do not get a function tag because at present 
the clause function tag is attached to the main verb. 
If the ellipsis co-occurs with coordination, then the 
presence of the coordinator in the beginning of the 
elliptical construction (i.e. to the right of the itera- 
tive clause boundary marker '@/') may be a sufficient 
clue to the function tag: it is to the left, in the first 
coordinate. 
Verbless constructions also occur in simplex con- 
structions. Consider the following real-text example:

In the analysis of if necessary, there is a subject 
complement tag for necessary. Subject complements 
typically occur in clauses; clauses in general are as- 
signed a syntactic function in our description; here, 
however, no such analysis is given due to the lack of 
a main verb. Nevertheless, in this type of verbless 
construction there is a lexical marker in the begin- 
ning: a subordinating conjunction or a WH word, 
and from this we can imply that the verbless con- 
struction functions as an adverbial. 
An alternative strategy for dealing with the func- 
tional analysis of verbless constructions would be 
the assignment of clause-function tags also to nom- 
inal and adverbial heads. This would increase the 
amount of ambiguity at the outset, but on the other 
hand this new ambiguity would be easily control- 
lable: a clausal construction serves only one func- 
tion at a time in our description, and this restriction 
can be easily formalised in the finite-state grammar 
formalism. 
Next, let us consider the description of preposi- 
tional phrases. In general, the present grammar tries 
to distinguish here between the adverbial function 
(@ADVL) and the postmodifier function (@N<). In 
the following somewhat contrived sentence, the dis- 
tinction is straightforward to make in some cases.

Q~ 
The phrase with difficulty is an unambiguous ad- 
verbial because it is directly preceded by a verb, 
which do not take postmodifiers. Likewise, with a 
telescope and of honor are unambiguously postmod- 
ifiers: the former because postnominal prepositional 
phrases without a verb in the left-hand context are 
postmodifiers; the latter because a postnominal of_ 
phrase is always a postmodifier unless the left-hand 
400 
context contains a member of a limited class of verbs 
like 'consist' and 'accuse' which take an of-phrase as 
a complement. 
On the contrary, with the binoculars i a problem 
case: generally postnominal prepositional phrases 
with a verb in the left-hand context are ambigu- 
ous due to the postmodifier and adverbial functions. 
Furthermore, several such ambiguous prepositional 
phrases can occur in a clause at once, so in combi- 
nation they can produce quite many grammatically 
acceptable analyses for a sentence. To avoid this un- 
comfortable situation, an underspecific tag has been 
introduced: a prepositional phrase is described un- 
ambiguously as @ADVL/N< if it occurs in a con- 
text legitimate for adverbials and postmodifiers - 
i.e., all other functions of prepositional phrases are 
disallowed in this context (with the exception of of- 
phrases). In all other contexts @ADVL/N< is disal- 
lowed. 
This solution may appear clumsy, e.g. a new tag is 
introduced for the purpose, but its advantage is that 
description can take full benefit of the unambiguous 
'easy' cases without paying the penalty of unmanage- 
able ambiguity as a price for the extra information. 
- Overall, this kind of practise may be useful in the 
treatment of certain other ambiguities as well. 
In this section we have examined the new tag 
scheme and how it responds to our two main require- 
ments: the requirement of structural resolvability 
(cf. our treatment of premodifiers and prepositional 
phrases) and expressiveness of surface-syntactic re- 
lations (witness e.g. the manner in which the appli- 
cation of the Uniqueness principle as well as the de- 
scription of clause distributions was made easier by 
extending the description). 
It goes without saying that even the present an- 
notation will leave some ambiguities structurally un- 
resolvable. For instance, coordination is still likely 
to pose problems, cf. the following ambiguity due to 
the preposition complement and object analyses:

Although the present system contains a powerful 
mechanism for expressing heuristic rules that can be 
used for ranking alternative analyses, the satisfactory 
treatment of ambiguities like this one seems to re- 
quire some further adjustment of the tag scheme, e.g. 
further underspecification - something like our de- 
scription of attachment ambiguities of prepositional 
phrases. 
5 Ambigu i ty  reso lu t ion  w i th  a 
f in i te -s ta te  parser  
In a parsing system where all potential analyses are 
provided in the input to the parser, there is bound 
to be a considerable amount of ambiguity as the de- 
scription becomes more distinctive. Consider the fol- 
lowing sentence, 39 words in length: 
A pressure lubrication system 
is employed, the pump, driven 
from the distributor shaft 
extension, drawing oil from the 
sump through a strainer and 
distributing it through the 
cartridge oil filter to a main 
gallery in the cylinder block 
casting. 
If only part-of-speech ambiguities are presented, 
there are 10 million sentence readings. If each bound- 
ary between each word or punctuation mark is made 
four-ways ambiguous due to the word and clause 
boundary readings, the overall number of sentence 
readings gets as high as 1032 readings. If all syn- 
tactic ambiguities are added, the sentence represen- 
tation contains 10 ee sentence readings. Regarded in 
isolation, each word in the sentence is 1-70 ways am- 
biguous. 
If we try to enumerate all 10 ee readings and dis- 
card them one by one, the work is far too huge to be 
done. But we do not have to do it that way. Next 
we show that in fact the number of readings does 
not alone predict parsing complexity. We show that 
if we adopt a powerful rule formalism and an accu- 
rate grammar, which is also effectively applied, a lot 
of ambiguity can be resolved in a very short time. 
We have seen above that very accurate analysis 
of running text can be achieved with a knowledge- 
based approach. Characteristic of such a system 
is the possibility to refer to grammatical categories 
at various levels of description within an arbitrar- 
ily long sentence context. - Regarding the viability 
of essentially statistical systems, the current experi- 
ence is that employing a window of more than two 
or three words requires excessively hard computing. 
Another problem is that even acquiring collocation 
matrices based on e.g. four-grams or five-grams re- 
quires tagged corpora much larger than the current 
manually validated tagged ones are. Also, mispredic- 
tions, which are a very common problem for statis- 
tical analysers, tend to bring in the accumulation ef- 
fect: more mispredictions are likely to occur at later 
stages of analysis. Therefore we do not have any rea- 
son to use unsure probabilistic information as long as 
we can use our more reliable linguistic knowledge. 
Our rules can be considered as constraints that 
discard some illegitimate readings. When we apply 
401 
rules one by one, the number of these readings de- 
creases, and, if possible, in the end we have only one 
reading left. In addition to the ordinary 'absolute' 
rules, the grammar can also contain separate 'heuris- 
tic' rules, which can be used for ranking remaining 
multiple readings. 
We represent sentences as finite state automata. 
This makes it possible to store all relevant sentence 
readings in a compact way. We also compile each 
grammar ule into a finite state automaton. Each 
rule automaton can be regarded as a constraint that 
accepts ome readings and rejects some. 
For example, consider the subject rule presented 
in Section 3. We can apply a rule like that on the 
sentence and, as a result, get an automaton that 
accepts all the sentence readings that are correct 
according to the rule. After this, our 1065-ways 
ambiguous entence has, say, only some 1045 read- 
ings left. This means that in some fractions of a 
second/" the number of readings is reduced into a 
1/10000000000000000000O0th part. All of these re- 
maining readings are accepted by the applied rule. 
Next, we can apply another ule, and so on. The fol- 
lowing rules will not probably reduce as many am- 
biguities as the first one, but they will reduce the 
ambiguity to some 'acceptable' level quite fast. This 
means that we cannot consider some sentences as un- 
parsable just because they may initially contain a lot 
of ambiguity (say, 101?? sentence readings). 
The real method we use is not as trivial as this, 
actually. The method presented above can rather be 
regarded as a declarative approach to applying the 
rules than as a description of a practical parser. A 
recent version of the parser combines everal meth- 
ods. First, it decreases the amount of ambiguity 
with some groups of carefully selected rules, as we 
described above. Then all other rules are applied to- 
gether. This method seems \[Tapanainen, 1992\] to 
provide a faster parser than more straightforward 
methods. 
Let us consider the different methods. In the first 
one we intersect a rule automaton with a sentence 
automaton and then we take another ule automa- 
ton that we intersect with the previous intermediate 
result, and so, on until all (relevant) rules have been 
applied. This method takes much time as we can see 
in the following table. The second method is like the 
first one but the rule automata have been ordered be- 
fore processing: the most efficient rules are applied 
first. This ordering seems to make parsing faster. In 
the third method we process all rules together and 
the fourth method is the one that is suggested above. 
The last method is like the fourth one but also extra 
information is used to direct the parsing. It seems 
to be quite sufficient for parsing. 
Before parsing commences, we can also use two 
methods for reducing the number of rule automata. 
Firstly, because the rules are represented as au- 
tomata, a set of them can be easily combined using 
intersection of automata during the rule compilation 
phase. Secondly, typically not all rules are needed 
in parsing because the rule may be about some cat- 
egory that is not even present in the sentence. We 
have a quick method for selecting rules in run-time. 
These optimization techniques improve parsing times 
considerably.

The test data is the same that was described above 
in Section 3.1. They were parsed on a Sun SparcSta- 
tion 2. 
The whole parsing scheme can be roughly pre- 
sented as 
? Preprocessing (text normalising and sentence 
boundary detection). 
? Morphological analysis and enrichment with 
syntactic and clause boundary ambiguities. 
? Transform each sentence into a finite state au- 
tomaton. 
? Select the relevant rules for the sentence. 
? Intersect a couple of rule groups with the sen- 
tence automaton. 
* Apply all remaining rules in parallel. 
? Rank the resulting multiple analyses according 
to heuristic rules and select the best one if a 
totally unambiguous result is wanted. 
6 Conclusion 
It seems to us that it is the nature of the grammar 
rules, rather than the amount of the ambiguity it- 
self, that determines the hardness of ambiguity res- 
olution. It is quite easy to write a grammar that 
is extremely hard to apply even for simple sentence 
with a small amount of ambiguity. Therefore parsing 
problems that come up from using more or less in- 
complete grammars do not necessarily tell us about 
parsing text with a comprehensive grammar. Pars- 
ing problems due to ambiguity seem to dissolve if we 
have access to a more expressive grammatical rep- 
resentation; witness our experiences with morpho- 
logical disambiguation using the two approaches dis- 
cussed above. 
We do not need to hesitate to use features that 
we consider useful in our grammatical description. 
The amount of ambiguity itself is not what enables 
or disables parsing. More important is that we have 
an effective grammar and parser that interact with 
each other in a sensible way, i.e. we should not try 
to kill mosquitos with artillery or to move mountains 
402 
with a spoon. The ambiguity that is introduced has 
Lo be relevant for the grammar, not unmotivaLed or 
structurally unresolvable ambiguity, but ambiguity 
that provides us with information we need to resolve 
other ambiguities.
