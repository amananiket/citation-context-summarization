Abst rac t  
In this paper we propose a corpus-based 
approach to anaphora resolution combin- 
ing a machine learning method and sta- 
tistical information. First, a decision tree 
trained on an annotated corpus determines 
the coreference r lation of a given anaphor 
and antecedent candidates and is utilized 
as a filter in order to reduce the num- 
ber of potential candidates. In the sec- 
ond step, preference selection is achieved 
by taking into account he frequency infor- 
mation of coreferential nd non-referential 
pairs tagged in the training corpus as well 
as distance features within the current dis- 
course. Preliminary experiments concern- 
ing the resolution of Japanese pronouns in 
spoken-language dialogs result in a success 
rate of 80.6%. 
1 In t roduct ion  
Coreference information is relevant for numerous 
NLP systems. Our interest in anaphora resolu- 
tion is based on the demand for machine translation 
systems to be able to translate (possibly omitted) 
anaphoric expressions in agreement with the mor- 
phosyntactic characteristics of the referred object in 
order to prevent contextual misinterpretations. 
So far various approaches 1 to anaphora resolution 
have been proposed. In this paper a machine learn- 
ing approach (decision tree) is combined with a pref- 
erence selection method based on the frequency in- 
formation of non-/coreferential pairs tagged in the 
corpus as well as distance features within the cur- 
rent discourse.

or only a minimal amount of human intervention. In 
the case of decision trees, we do have to provide in- 
formation about possible antecedent indicators (syn- 
tactic, semantic, and pragmatic features) contained 
in the corpus, but the relevance of features for the 
resolution task is extracted automatically from the 
training data. 
Machine learning approaches using decision trees 
proposed so far have focused on preference selection 
criteria directly derived from the decision tree re- 
sults. The work described in (Conolly et al, 1994) 
utilized a decision tree capable of judging which one 
of two given anaphor-antecedent pairs is "better". 
Due to the lack of a strong assumption on "transi- 
tivity", however, this sorting algorithm is more like 
a greedy heuristic search as it may be unable to find 
the "best" solution. 
The preference selection for a single antecedent in
(Aone and Bennett, 1995) is based on the maximiza- 
tion of confidence values returned from a pruned de- 
cision tree for given anaphor-candidate pairs. How- 
ever, decision trees are characterized by an indepen- 
dent learning of specific features, i.e., relations be- 
tween single attributes cannot be obtained automat- 
ically. Accordingly, the use of dependency factors 
for preference selection during decision tree train- 
ing requires that the artificially created attributes 
expressing these dependencies be defined. However, 
this not only extends human intervention into the 
automatic learning procedure (i.e., which dependen- 
cies are important?), but can also result in some 
drawbacks on the contextual adaptation of prefer- 
ence selection methods. 
The preference selection in our approach is based 
on the combination of statistical frequency informa- 
tion and distance features in the discourse. There- 
fore, our decision tree is not applied directly to the 
task of preference selection, but aims at the elimina- 
tion of irrelevant candidates based on the knowledge 
obtained from the training data. 
47 
The decision tree is trained on syntactic (lexi- 
cal word attributes), semantic, and primitive dis- 
course (distance, frequency) information and deter- 
mines the coreferential relation between an anaphor 
and antecedent Candidate in the given context. Irrel- 
evant antecedent candidates are filtered out, achiev- 
ing a noise reduction for the preference selection 
algorithm. A preference value is assigned to each " 
potential anaphor-candidate pair depending on the 
proportion of non-/coreferential occurrences of the 
pair in the training corpus (frequency ratio) and the 
relative position of both elements in the discourse 
(distance). The candidate with the maximal pref- 
erence value is resolved as the antecedent of the 
anaphoric expression. 
2 Corpus-Based Anaphora Resolution 
In this section we introduce a new approach to 
anaphora resolution based on coreferential proper- 
ties automatically extracted from a training corpus. 
In the first step, the decison tree filter is trained on 
the linguistic, discourse and coreference information 
annotated in the training corpus which is described 
in section 2.1.

Figure 1: System outline 
The resolution system in Figure 1 applies the 
coreference filter (cf. section 2.2) to all anaphor- 
candidate pairs (Ai + C/#) found in the discourse his- 
tory. The detection of anaphoric expressions i out 
of the scope of this paper and just reduced to tags 
in our annotated corpus. Antecedent candidates are 
identified according to noun phrase part-of-speech 
tags. The reduced set (Ai + C/~) forms the input 
of the preference algorithm which selects the most 
salient candidate C~ as described in section 2.3. 
Preliminary experiments are conducted for the 
task of pronominal anaphora resolution and the per- 
formance of our system is evaluated in section 3. 
2.1  Data  Corpus  
For our experiments we use the ATR-ITL Speech 
and Language Database (Takezawa et al, 1998) con- 
sisting of 500 Japanese spoken-language dialogs an- 
notated with coreferential tags. It includes nomi- 
nal, pronominal, and ellipsis annotations, whereby 
the anaphoric expressions used in our experiments 
are limited to those referring to nominal antecedents 
(nominal: 2160, pronominal: 526, ellipsis: 3843). 
Besides the anaphor type, we also include mor- 
phosyntactic nformation like stem form and inflec- 
tion attributes for each surface word as well as se- 
mantic codes for content words (Ohno and Haman- 
ishi, 1981) in this corpus.

\[thank you very much\] \[City Hotel\] 
'~'hank you for calling City Hotel." 
\[hello\] \[l\]\[Himko Tanaka\]\[the name is\] 
"Hello, my name is Hiroko Tanaka." 
\]there\] \[hotel\] \[reservation\]\[wonld like to have\] 
"I would like to make a reservation at your hotel."

"It's T A N A K A." 
\[yes\] \[tenth\] \[here\] \[arrival\] \[be\] 
"Okay, you will arrive here on the tenth, right?" 
Figure 2: Example dialog 
In the example dialog between the hotel reception 
(r) and a customer (c) listed in Figure 2 the proper 
noun (r l )"5,#-# ~Y-~P \[City Hotel\]" is tagged as 
the antecedent of the pronoun (cl)"~-~5 ~9 \[there\]" 
as well as the noun (cl)"$ff-)l~ \[hotel\]". An exam- 
ple for ellipsis is the ommitted subject (c2)"@\[it\]" 
referring to (r2)"Y~-x~P \[spelling\]". 
According to the tagging guidelines used for our 
corpus an anaphoric tag refers to the most recent 
antecedent found in the dialog. However, this an- 
tecedent might also refer to a previous one, e.g. 
(r3)"~- ?9 ~ \[here\]"-*(cl)" ~-?9 ~ \[there\]"--~(rl) " 5" 
~-~" ? ~)P \[City Hotel\]". Thus, the transitive clo- 
sure between the anaphora nd the first mention of 
the antecedent in the discourse history defines the 
set of positive examples, e.g. (~-~ ~9, 5,if-4 $~-)P), 
whereas the nominal candidates outside the transi- 
tive closure are considered negative xamples, e.g. 
(~- ~5 C9, ~ qu), for coreferential relationships. 
Based on the corpus annotations we extract 
the frequency information of coreferential naphor- 
antecedent pairs and non-referential pairs from the 
training data. For each non-/coreferential pair the 
occurrences of surface and stem form as well as se- 
mantic code combinations are counted.

The values freq +, freq-  and ratio and their usage 
are described in more detailed in section 2.3. 
Moreover, each dialog is subdivided into utter- 
ances consisting of one or more clauses. There- 
fore, distance features are available on the utterance, 
clause, candidate, and morpheme levels. For exam- 
ple, the distance values of the pronoun (r3)"~- ?9 
\[here\]" and the antecedent (rl)" "Y if-4 ? ff-)l~ \[City 
Hotel\]" in our sample dialog in Figure 2 are d~tte~=4, 
dclaus~=7, dcand=14, dmorph=40. 
2.2 Core ferenee  Analys is  
To learn the coreference relations from our corpus 
we have chosen a C4.52-1ike machine learning al- 
gorithm without pruning. The training attributes 
consist of lexical word attributes (surface word, stem 
form, part-of-speech, semantic ode, morphological 
attributes) applied to the anaphor, antecedent can- 
didate, and clause predicate. In addition, features 
like attribute agreement, distance and frequency ra- 
tio are checked for each anaphor-candidate pair. The 
decision tree result consists of only two classes de- 
termining the coreference r lation between the given 
anaphor-candidate pair. 
During anaphora resolution the decision tree is 
used as a module determining the coreferential prop- 
erty of each anaphor-candidate pair. For each de- 
tected anaphoric expression a candidate list 3 is cre- 
ated. The decision tree filter is then successively 
applied to all anaphor-candidate pairs. 
If the decision tree results in the non-reference 
class, the candidate is judged as irrelevant and elim- 
inated from the list of potential antecedents forming 
the input of the preference selection algorithm. 
2.3 P re ference  Select ion 
The primary order of candidates is given by their 
word distance from the anaphoric expression. A 
straightforward preference strategy we could choose 
is the selection of the most recent candidate (MRC) 
as the antecedent, i.e., the first element of the can- 
didate list. The success rate of this baseline test, 
however, is quite low as shown in section 3. 
But, this result does not mean that the recency 
factor is not important at all for the determination 
of saliency in this task. One reason for the bad per- 
formance is the application of the baseline test to the 
unfiltered set of-candidates resulting in the frequent 
selection of non-referential ntecedents. Addition- 
ally, long-range references to candidates introduced 
first in the dialog are quite frequent in our  data. 
2Cf. (Quinlan, 1993) 
3A list of noun phrase candidates preceding the 
anaphor element in the current discourse. 
An examination of our corpus gives rise to sus- 
picion that similarities to references in our training 
data might be useful for the identification of those 
antecedents. Therefore, we propose a preference se- 
lection scheme based on the combination of distance 
and frequency information. 
First, utilizing statistical information about the 
frequency of coreferential naphor-antecedent pairs 
(freq +) and non-referential pairs ( f req-)  extracted 
from the training data, we define the ratio of a given 
reference pair as follows4: 
I -6  : (freq + -- f req-  = O) ratio = \ ] req  + - \ ] req -  f req+ 4- \ ] req -  : otherwise 
The value of ratio is in the range of \[-1,-1-1\], 
whereby ratio = -1  in the case of exclusive non- 
referential relations and ratio -- +1 in the case of 
exclusive coreferential relationships. In order for ref- 
erential pairs occurring in the training corpus with 
ratio = 0 to be preferred to those without frequency 
information, we slightly decrease the ratio value of 
the latter ones by a factor 6. 
As mentioned above the distance plays a crucial 
role in our selection method, too. We define a pref- 
erence value pref  by normalizing the ratio value ac- 
cording to the distance dist given by the primary 
order of the candidates in the discourse. 
ratio 
pre f = dist 
The pref value is calculated for each candidate and 
the precedence ordered list of candidates i resorted 
towards the maximization of the preference factor. 
Similarly to the baseline test, the first element of 
the preferenced candidate list is chosen as the an- 
tecedent. The precedence order between candidates 
of the same confidence continues to remain so and 
thus a final decision is made in the case of a draw. 
The robustness of our approach is ensured by the 
definition of a backup strategy which ultimately se- 
lects one candidate occurring in the history in the 
case that all antecedent candidates are rejected by 
the decision tree filter. For our experiments reported 
in section 3 we adopted the selection of the dialog- 
initial candidate as the backup strategy. 
3 Eva luat ion  
For the evaluation of the experimental results de- 
scribed in this section we use F-measure metrics cal- 
culated by the recall and precision of the system per- 
formance. Let ~\]t denote the total number of tagged

anaphor-antecedent pairs contained in the test data, 
E l  the number of these pairs passing the decision 
tree filter, and ~ the number of correctly selected 
antecedents. 
During evaluation we distinguish three classes: 
whether the correct antecedent is the first element of 
the candidate list (f), is in the candidate list (i), or 
is filtered out by the decision tree (o). The metrics 
F, recall (R) and precision (P) are defined as follows:

Figure 3: Preference selection experiments 
First, the baseline test MRC selects the most re- 
cent candidate as the antecedent of an anaphoric ex- 
pression. The necessity of the filter and preference 
selection components i  shown by comparing the de- 
cision tree filter scheme DT (i.e., select the first el- 
ement of the filtered candidate list) and preference 
scheme PREF (i.e., resort the complete candidate 
list) against our combined method DT+PREF (i.e., 
resort the filtered candidate list). 
5-way cross-validation experiments are conducted 
for pronominal anaphora resolution. The selected 
antecedents are checked against the annotated cor- 
rect antecedents according to their morphosyntactic 
and semantic attributes. 
3.1 Training Size 
We use varied numbers of training dialogs (50-400) 
for the training of the decision tree and the extrac- 
tion of the frequency information from the corpus. 
Open tests are conducted on 100 non-training dialogs 
whereas closed tests use the training data for evalua- 
tion. The results of the different preference selection 
methods are shown in Figure 4. 
The baseline test MRC succeeds in resolving only 
43.9% of the most recent candidates correctly as 
the antecedent. The best F-measure rate for DT is 
65.0% and for PREF the best rate is 78.1% whereas

Figure 4: Training size versus performance 
the combination of both methods achieves a success 
rate of 80.6%. 
The PREF method seems to reach a plateau at 
around 300 dialogs which is borne out by the closed 
test reaching a maximum of 81.1%. Comparing the 
recall rate of DT (61.2%) and DT+PREF (75.9%) 
with the PREF result, we might conclude that the 
decision tree is not much of a help due to the side- 
effect of 11.8% of the correct antecedents being fil- 
tered out. 
However, in contrast o the PREF algorithm, the 
DT method improves continuously according to the 
training size implying a lack of training data for the 
identification of potential candidates. Despite the 
sparse data the filtering method proves to be very 
effective. The average number of all candidates (his- 
tory) for a given anaphor in our open data is 39 can- 
didates which is reduced to 11 potential candidates 
by the decision tree filter resulting in a reduction rate 
of 71.8% (closed test: 81%). The number of trivial 
selection cases (only one candidate) increases from 
2.7% (history) to 11.4% (filter; closed test: 21%). 
On average, two candidates are skipped in the his- 
tory to select the correct antecedent. 
Moreover, the precision rates of DT (69.4%) and 
DT+PREF (86.0%) show that the utilization of the 
decision tree filter in combination with the statisti- 
cal preference selection gains a relative improvement 
of 9% towards the preference and 16% towards the 
filter method. 
Additionally, the system proves to be quite robust, 
because the decision tree filters out all candidates 
in only 1% of the open test samples. Selecting the 
candidate first introduced in the dialog as a backup 
strategy shows the best performance due to the fre- 
quent dialog initial references contained in our data.

3.2 Feature  Dependency  
In our approach frequency ratio and distance infor- 
mation plays a crucial role not only for the identi- 
fication of potential candidates during decision tree 
filtering, but also for the calculation of the prefer- 
ence value for each antecedent candidate. 
In the first case these features are used indepen- 
dently to characterize the training samples whereas 
the preference selection method is based on the de- 
pendency between the frequency and distance values 
of the given anaphor-candidate pair in the context 
of the respective discourse. The relative importance 
of each factor is shown in Table 2. 
First, we compare our decision tree filter DT to 
those methods that do not use either frequency (DT- 
no-freq) or distance (DT-no-dist) information. Fre- 
quency information does appear to be more relevant 
for the identification of potential candidates than 
distance features extracted from the training corpus. 
The recall performance of DT-no-freq decreases by 
7.6% whereas DT-no-dist is only 1.1% below the re- 
sult of the original DT filter 5. Moreover, the number 
of correct antecedents not passing the filter increases 
by 5.1% (DT-no-freq) and 0.7% (DT-no-dist). 
However, the distance factor proves to be quite 
important as a preference criterion. Relying only on 
the frequency ratio as the preference value, the re- 
call performance of DT+PREF-no-dist is only 73.0%, 
down 2.9% of the original DT+PREF method. 
The effectiveness of our approach is not only based 
on the usage of single antecedent indicators ex- 
tracted from the corpus, but also on the combination 
of these features for the selection of the most prefer- 
able candidate in the context of the given discourse. 
4 Re la ted  Research  
Due to the characteristics of the underlying data 
used in these experiments a comparison involving 
absolute numbers to previous approaches gives us 
less evidence. However, the difficulty of our task 
can be verified according to the baseline xperiment 
5So far we have considered the decision tree filter just 
as a black-box tool. Further investigations ontree struc- 
tures, however, should give us more evidence about the 
relative importance of the respective f atures. 
results reported in (Mitkov, 1998). Resolving pro- 
nouns in English technical manuals to the most re- 
cent candidate achieved a success rate of 62.5%, 
whereas in our experiments only 43.9% of the most 
recent candidates are resolved correctly as the an- 
tecedent (cf. section 3). 
Whereas knowledge-based ystems like (Carbonell 
and Brown, 1988) and (Rich and LuperFoy, 1988) 
combining multiple resolution strategies are expen- 
sive in the cost of human effort at development time 
and limited ability to scale to new domains, more re- 
cent knowledge-poor approaches like (Kennedy and 
Boguraev, 1996) and (Mitkov, 1998) address the 
problem without sophisticated linguistic knowledge. 
Similarly to them we do not use any sentence parsing 
or structural analysis, but just rely on morphosyn- 
tactic and semantic word information. 
Moreover, clues are used about the grammatical 
and pragmatic functions of expressions as in (Grosz 
et al, 1995), (Strube, 1998), "or (Azzam et al, 
1998) as well as rule-based empirical approaches like 
(Nakaiwa and Shirai, 1996) or (Murata and Nagao, 
1997), to determine the most salient referent. These 
kinds of manually defined scoring heuristics, how- 
ever, involve quite an amount of human intervention 
which is avoided in machine learning approaches. 
As briefly noted in section 1, the work described 
in (Conolly et al, 1994) and (Aone and Bennett, 
1995) differs from our approach according to the us- 
age of the decision tree in the resolution task. In 
(Conolly et al, 1994) a decision tree is trained on 
a small number of 15 features concerning anaphor 
type, grammatical function, recency, morphosyntac- 
tic agreement and subsuming concepts. Given two 
anaphor-candidate pairs the system judges which 
is "better". However, due to the lack of a strong 
assumption on "transitivity" this sorting algorithm 
may be unable to find the "best" solution. 
Based on discourse markers extracted from lexical, 
syntactic, and semantic processing, the approach of 
(Aone and Bennett, 1995) uses 66 unary and bi- 
nary attributes (lexical, syntactic, semantic, posi- 
tion, matching category, topic) during decision tree 
training. The confidence values returned from the 
pruned decision tree are utilized as a saliency mea- 
sure for each anaphor-candidate pair in order to se- 
51 
lect a single antecedent. However, we use depen- 
dency factors for preference selection which cannot 
be learned automatically because of the indepen- 
dent learning of specific features during decision tree 
training. Therefore, our decision tree is not applied 
directly to the task of preference selection, but only 
used as a filter to reduce the number of potential 
candidates for preference selection. 
In addition to salience preference, a statistically 
modeled iexical preference is exploited in (Dagan et 
al., 1995) by comparing the conditional probabili- 
ties of co-occurrence patterns given the occurrence 
of candidates. Experiments, however, are carried 
out on computer manual texts with mainly intra- 
sentential references. This kind of data is also char- 
acterized by the avoidance of disambiguities and 
only short discourse units, which prohibits almost 
any long-range references. In contrast o this re- 
search, our results show that the distance factor in 
addition to corpus-based frequency information is 
quite relevant for the selection of the most salient 
candidate in our task. 
5 Conclusion 
In this paper we proposed a corpus-based anaphora 
resolution method combining an automatic learning 
algorithm for coreferential relationships with statis- 
tical preference selection in the discourse context. 
We proved the applicability of our approach to pro- 
noun resolution achieving a resolution accuracy of 
86.0% (precision) and 75.9% (recall) for Japanese 
pronouns despite the limitation of sparse data. Im- 
provements in these results can be expected by in- 
creasing the training data as well as utilizing more 
sophisticated linguistic knowledge (structural anal- 
ysis of utterances, etc.) and discourse information 
(extra-sentential knowledge, etc.) which should lead 
to a rise of the decision tree filter performance. 
Preliminary experiments with nominal reference 
and ellipsis resolution showed promising results, too. 
We plan to incorporate this approach in multi- 
lingual machine translation which enables us to han- 
dle a variety of referential relations in order to im- 
prove the translation quality.
