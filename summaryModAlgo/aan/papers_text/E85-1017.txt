preconstructed dictionaries or thesauruses. Even 
in this relatively simplified environment one does 
not normally undertake a linguistic analysis of any 
scope. In fact, syntactic and semantic analysis 
have been used in b ib l iograph ic  information 
retrieval only under special circumstances to 
analyze query phrases \[22\], to process structured 
text samples of a certain kind, \[7,15\], or finally 
to process  texts  in  severe ly  res t r i c ted  top ic  
areas. \[2\] 
Where spec ia l  cond i t ions  do not  obta in ,  the  
pre fer red  approach  in  in fo rmat ion  re t r ieva l  has  
been to  use s ta t i s t i ca l  or p robab i l i s t i c  c r i te r ia  
fo r  the  generat ion  of the  content  ident i f ie rs  
ass igned to  documents and search  quer ies .  Obvi -  
ous ly ,  not  a l l  terms are  equa l ly  use fu l  fo r  content  
identification. Accordin E to the term discrimina- 
tion theory, the following criteria are of impor- 
tance i n  th i s  connect ion  \ [16 \ ] :  
a) te rms which occur  w i th  h igh  f requency  in  
the  documents of a co l lec t ion  are  not  p re -  
fe r red  fo r  content  representat ion  because  
such terms are  too broad  to  d i s t ingu ish  the  
documents from each o ther ;  
b) te rms which occur  w i th  very  low f requency  
in  the  co l lec t ion  are  a l so  not  opt ima l ,  
because  such terms a f fec t  on ly  a very  smal l  
f rac t ion  of documents ;  
c) the  best  terms tend to be low-to-medium 
f requency  ent i t ies  which can be produced by 
taking single terms that exhibit the 
required frequency characteristics; alter- 
natively, it is possible to obtain medium 
frequency entities by refining high fre- 
quency terms thereby rendering them more 
narrow, or by broadening low frequency 
terms. 
In many operational information situations, 
the term broadening and narrowing operations are 
effectively carried out by using formulations in 
which the terms are connected by Boolean operators. 
The use of Boolean logic in retrieval is discussed 
in more detail in the remainder of this note.

2. Extended Boolean Logic in Information Retrieval 
I t  i s  customary to express  in fo rmat ion  search  
requests  by us ing  Boolean fo rmulas  that  inc lude  the  
operators  and,  o r ,  and no~. Of par t i cu la r  in teres t  
in  a l ingu is t i c  context  are  the  and and or  opera -  
to rs :  
a) 
b) 
The and-operator  i s  a dev ice  fo r  spec i fy ing  
a compulsory phrase  where a l l  terms in  the 
and-c lause  must be present  to  a f fec t  the  
re t r ieva l  operat ion .  Thus a query s ta te -  
ment such as " in fo rmat ion  and re t r ieva l "  i s  
used to  represent  the compound nomina ls  
" in fo rmat ion  re t r ieva l " ,  or  " re t r ieva l  of 
in fo rmat ion" .  The and-operator  i s  used as 
a re f in ing  dev ice  s ince  a broad term such 
as " in fo rmat ion"  i s  made more spec l f l c  when 
i t  i s  incorporated  in  an and-c lause .  
The or -operator ,  on the o ther  hand,  i s  a 
dev ice  fo r  spec i fy ing  a group of  synonymous 
te rms,  or  a l te rnat ive ly ,  a thesaurus  c lass  
of terms in  which a l l  terms are  t reated  as 
coequa l .  That i s ,  any one term in  an or -  
c lause  w i l l  cause re t r ieva l  of the  
cor respond ing  document,  and each term i s  
assumed to be as  good as any o ther  term.  
The or -operator  i s  a b roaden ing  dev ice  
because each or -c lause  has a broader  scope 
than  any ind iv idua l  c lause  component.  
Whi le the log ica l  operators  ,nd and or  a re  
used un iversa l ly  in  re t r ieva l  env i ronments ,  the  
assompt ions  of Boolean log ic  a re  not  ver i f ied  in  
normal text processing enviror..ents. Strict 
synonyms occur relatively rarely in query formula- 
tions or in the texts of documents, so that the 
nOrmal o r -c lause  does not  re f lec t  a pract i ca l  
situation. In fact, it should be possible to make 
distinctions between more or less important terms 
in an or-clause; furthermore, or-clauses should be 
usable to represent collections of loosely related 
terms ins tead  of on ly  s t r i c t  synonyms, Ana lo -  
gous ly ,  i t  shou ld  be poss ib le  to  re lax  the  compul-  
sory nature  of the phrase  components inc luded in  an 
~&~-c lause ,  and d is t inc t ions  ought to be in t roduca-  
b le  between phrase  components of g reater  or  lesser  
impor tance .  
In summary, the uncertain (fuzzy) nature of 
the term relationships which obtain in the natural 
language are not reflected by the rules of ordinary 
Boolean logic. \[25\] Instead a relaxed type of 
logic is needed which is capable of broadening or 
narrowing the term units, while also providing for 
distinctions in term importance and for the specif- 
ication of fuzzy or soft term relationships. Such 
an extended logical system was introduced recently 
with the following main properties: \[17-18\] 
a) The extended log ic  system d is t ingu ishes  
among more or less  impor tant  terms in  both  
guer ies  and documents by us ing  we ights ,  or 
importance ind icators  a t tached to the 
te rms.  Thus ins tead  of terms A and B, the  
system processes  terms (A.a)  and (B,b) 
respect ive ly ,  where a and b des ignate  the 
we ights  of terms A and B. 
b) 
c) 
d) 
The extended system simulates the llnguis- 
tic characteristics of more or less strict 
synonyms, by attaching a ~-value to each 
or-operator that specifies the degree of 
strictness of the corresponding operator. 
The higher the p-value attached to an 
operator, the closer is the interpretation 
of that operator in accordance with the 
rules of ordinary Boolean logic. On the 
other hand, the smaller the p-value, the 
more relaxed is the interpretation of the 
or-operator. 
The extended system a lso  s imulates  the  
l ingu is t i c  character i s t i cs  of more or less  
s t r i c t  phrase  a t tachment ,  by us in  E a p- 
va lue  fo r  each and-operator .  The h igher  
the  p -va lue ,  the  more s imi la r  ? the  
cor respond ing  operator  w i l l  be to the  com- 
pu lsory  Boolean and. Cor respond ing ly ,  the  
smal le r  the  p -va lue ,  the  more re laxed  i s  
the  in terpretat ion  of the  and operator .  
The extended system (un l ike  the  ord inary  
Boolean system) prov ides  ranked output  of 
the  s tored  documents in  presumed decreas ing  
order  of impor tance  of a g iven  i tem wi th  
respect  to  a query .  In add i t ion ,  the  
extended system prov ides  much bet ter  
re t r ieva l  output ,  than  systems based on 
convent iona l  Boolean log ic .  Exper imen-  
ta l l y ,  improvements of 100 to 200 percent  
in  re t r ieva l  e f fec t iveness  have been noted  
fo r  the  extended log ic  over  the  conven-  
t iona l  Boolean system.  \ [17 ,18 \ ]  
It is not possible in the present context to 
furnish the details of the operation of the 
extended logic system. The following results are, 
however, relatively easy to prove: \[17\] 
a) When p -va lues  equa l  to  in f in i ty  a re  used,  
the  extended system produces  resu l t s  ident -  
i ca l  to  that  of the  convent iona l  Boolean 
log ic  sys tems;  
b) When the p-values are reduced from infin- 
ity, the distinctions between phrase com- 
ponents (and) and synonym specification 
(or) become more and more blurred; 
c) When p reaches its lower limit of 1, the 
distinction between and and or operators is 
completely lost. and the system reduces the 
queries (A and B) and (A or B) to a system 
with terms (A,B), without any relationship 
specification between terms A and B. 
Using linguistic analogues, the following 
examples illustrate the operations of the extended 
logic system. The p-value attached to operators is 
shown in each case as an exponent: 
117 
i) (A andco B) i n te rpreted  as ALL OF (A,B) (strict phrase) 
iii (A and 3 B) interpreted as MOST OF (A,B) (fuzzy phrase) 
iii) (A and I B) interpreted as SET (A,B) (more matching terms are worth more 
than fewer matching terms) 
iv) (A fl~ I B) identical to (A ~nd I B) interpreted as SET (A,B) 
v) (A ~ 3 B) interpreted as SOME OF (A,B) (fuzzy synonym) 
vi) (A ~ B) interpreted as ONE OF (A,B) (strict synonym) 
3. Experimental Results 
The operations of the extended logic system 
are illustrated by using a collection of 3204 com- 
puter sc ience  ar t i c les  ( t i t les  and abst rac ts )  o r i -  
g ina l ly  pub l i shed  in  the  C~un icat ions  of the  ACM 
( the  CACM co l lec t ion) ,  and a co l lec t ion  of 1460 
ar t i c les  in  l ib rary  sc ience  obta ined  from the  
Ins t i tu te  fo r  Sc ient i f i c  In fomat ion  ( the  CISI  co l -  
l ec t ion) .  Tab le  1 shows average  per fo rmance  f ig -  
u res  fo r  7 se lec ted  quer ies  used w i th  CACM, and 4 
se lec ted  quer ies  fo r  C IS I .  The per fo rmance  in  
Tab le  1 i s  s ta ted  in  terms of the  search  Drec ls lon  
a t  var ious  ~ po in ts  averaged over  the  set  of 
search  requests  in  use .  \ [19\]  
The data  of  Tab le  1 ind icate  that  the  conven-  
t iona l  Boolean searches  (p = co, Boolean)  produce 
by fa r  the  wors t  per fo rmance  fo r  both  co l lec t ions .  
Per formance improvements between 100 and 200 per -  
cent  are  obta ined  by re lax ing  the  in terpretat ion  of 
the  Boolean operators  ( that  i s ,  by us ing  lower p- 
va lues) .  A d i s t inc t ion  must  be made between tak ing  
in to  account  on ly  s ing le  term matches  (p -va lues  are  
equa l  to 1) ,  and g iv ing  ext ra  we ight  to  term phrase  
matches  (A and B .rid . . . ) ,  and to  synonym set  
matches  (A or  B o r  . . . ) ,  when p -va lues  h igher  than  
1 must be used.  The resu l t s  of Tab le  I show that  
fo r  the  CACM quer ies  the  best  overa l l  po l i cy  i s  a 
complete so f ten ing  of the  Boolean operators  down to  
p = 1. Ev ident ly  not  many of the  quas i -Boo lean  
phrases  inc luded in  the  CACM quer ies  were a l so  
present  in  the  document abst rac ts .  For the  IS I  
quer ies ,  on the  o ther  hand,  154 percent  improvement 
i s  produced when p = 1; when the  phrase  combina-  
t ions  a re  g iven  ext ra  we ight ,  the  improvement in  
per formance jumps to 164 percent  fo r  p = 2, and to 
182 percent  when and-  and or -operatocs  a re  g iven  
different values (p and = 2.5 and p or = 1.5, 
respectively). 
These phenomena are further illustrated in the 
output of Tables 2 and 3. The comparison between 
query CACM Q5 and Document 756 is outlined in Table 
2. No abstract was available for document 756; 
hence only the title words could be used in the 
query-document comparison. As the  example shows. 
only the term "editing" was present in both docu- 
ment title and query. This explains why the single 
term match (p = l) produces the best output rank of 
5 for this document. Obviously, the sample docu- 
ment is not retrievable by the pure Boolean search 
(p = co) as demonstrated by the simulated retrieval 
rank of 1667 out of 3204 CACM documents. 
Table 3 shows an example where matching 
phrases make a substantial difference in the 
retrieval results. The matched phrases in Document 
1410 are given a double underline in Table 3, 
whereas matched single terms have a single under- 
line. The output of Table 3 shows that when the 
s ing le  terms a lone  are  cons idered ,  document 1410 i s  
re t r ieved  w i th  a rank  of  53 in  response  to  query 
IS I  Q33. When the  phrase  matches  are  g iven  ext ra  
weight (p = 2. or p and = 5, p or = 2), the 
re t r ieva l  rank  improves to  2 and 7, respect ive ly .  
These resu l t s  demonst ra te  that  the  conven-  
t iona l  Boolean log ic  does not  adequate ly  re f lec t  
the  tentat ive  and uncer ta in  nature  of the  re la t ions  
between terms in  the  language.  When a re laxed  
in terpretat ion  of Boo lean log ic  i s  used,  the  
correspondence with the fuzzy nature of linguistic 
relations is much greater and dramatic improvements 
in term matching and hence retrieval effectiveness 
are obtained. 
4. Relationship of Extended Boolean Model with 
Other Retrieval Developments 
The extended Boolean system is based on the 
use of certain term relationships--notably term 
phrases and synonymous constructions. These rela- 
tions are. however, interpreted flexibly, reflect- 
ing the uncertain nature of term relations in the 
language. Tn the extended system, soft Boolean 
queries are easy to formulate, and methods exist 
for a completely automatic formulation of the soft 
queries, given only some basic information about 
user needs .  \[20\] Analogously, initial queries may 
be automatically reformulated, following an initial 
search operation, based on information obtained 
from the user about the relevance of previously 
retrieved documents. \[183 
The current development may then be related to 
other retrieval models that incorporate term rela- 
tions, and to systems with advanced user inter- 
faces. Term relations of a statistical, or proba- 
bilistic nature are included in the probabilistic 
retrieval model; more general linguistic relations 
are used in systems that include a natural language 
analyzer. In the  probabilistic retrieval system, 
the documents are ranked in decreasing order of the 
probabilistic expression p(x\[rel)/P(xlnonrel) where 
P(x~rel) and P(x\[nonrel) represent the occurrence 
probabilities of an item x in the relevant and non- 
relevant document subsetso respectively. \[23\] The

Unfortunately, the experiences accumulated 
with the probabilistic retrieval model show that 
enough information is rarely available in practical 
situations to render possible an accurate estima- 
tion of the needed probabilities. In practice, it 
then becomes necessary to avoid the use of term 
dependencies by assuming that all terms occur 
independently. The probabilistic model is then 
effectively equivalent to a vector processing sys- 
tem that does not include any term relations. \[3\] 
When l ingu is t i c  ana lys i s  methods are  used to  
ana lyze  query  and document content ,  i t  i s  in  theory  
poss ib le  to prov ide  a prec ise  representat ion  of 
query and document content  by inc lud ing  a great  
var ie ty  ot term re la t ions  in  the  search  and 
retrieval Operations. In particular, complex 
indexing units such as noun and prepositional 
phrases might then be assigned to the information 
items for content representation, Unfortunately, a 
complete treatment of noun phrases by automatic 
means remains elusive in view of the multiplicity 
of different term relations that are expressible by 
noun and prepositional phrases. An automatic 
recognition of semantically equivalent noun phrases 
of the kind needed for the construction of classif- 
ication schedules is also exceedingly difficult. 
For pract i ca l  purposes ,  the  use of term re la -  
t ions  that  is theoret i ca l ly  poss ib le  in the  proba-  
bilistic and language-based retrieval models is 
120 
thus of questionable help in general retrieval 
situations where topic areas and linguistic com- 
plexities are not severely restricted. The Boolean 
model which includes only a general pnrase (den, tea 
by the Boolean and) and a general synonym relation 
(denote~ by the Boolean ~tE) may not therefore 
represent an intolerable simplification when meas- 
ured against the realistically possible, alterna- 
tive methodo log ies .  
Considering now the user-system interfaces 
that have been designed for use in information 
retrieval, the following types ot development may 
be distinguished. 
a) The use of minicomputer-based file access- 
ing methods providing simple access to 
specific data bases, or to specific file 
cata logs .  Such systems are  o f ten  menu- 
dr iven  and o t fe r  a conversat iona l  s ty le ,  
permi t t ing  the  user  to consu l t  a g iven  term 
c lass i f i ca t ion  or thesaurus ,  and to  browse 
through the doc~ent  cor respond ing  to  a 
g iven  query fo rmulat ion .  \ [4 ,6 J  
b) The const ruct ion  of la rge ,  soph is t i ca ted  
systems des igned to  prov ide  un i f ied  in ter -  
face  methods to a var ie ty  of data  bases  
implemented on a single retrieval facility, 
or to data bases available on a multipli- 
city of different retrieval systems. 
\[12,13\] A connnon command language may 
then be provided by the interface system, 
in addition to tutorial and help provi- 
sions, or even d iagnost i c  p rocedures  ab le  
to detect ,  and poss ib ly  to cor rect  ques -  
t ionab le  search  s t ra teg ies .  
c) The use of interface methods based on fancy 
graphic displays that make it possible to  
exhibit vocabulary schedules, command 
sequences ,  and messages that  may be he lp fu l  
dur ing  the course  of the  search  operat ions .  
\[5,103 
d) The simulation ot automatic "search 
experts" that are able to translate arbi- 
trary queries in natural language by using 
stored knowledge bases for query analysis 
and search purposes, Such automatic 
experts may perform the work normally 
assigned to human search intermediaries, in 
the sense that a conversational dialog sys- 
tem ascertains user requirements and 
chooses search strategies corresponding to 
particular user needs. \[8,9\] 
In each case the automatic interface system is 
designed to help the user to access a possibly 
unfamiliar retrieval system and to pick a useful 
search strategy. The operational retrieval system 
that actually performs the searches is normally not 
modified by the interface system. The extended 
Boolean system described in this note differs from 
these other developments because the conventional 
search system is actually modified by replacing a 
complete Boolean match by a fuzzy query-document 
comparison system. Furthermore, the burden placed 
on the user during the query construction process 
is kept as small as possible. 
The minicomputer-based facilities and the 
fancy graphic di,play systems may be used in con- 
junction with the extended Boolean processing, 
since the two types of developments are somewhat 
independent of each other, The same is true of the 
systems that provide common interfaces to mulriple 
data bases. The retrieval expert capable of 
interacting with the user in natural language may 
not he usable in practical situations for some 
years to come, unless severe restrictions are 
imposed on the topic areas under consideration, and 
the freedom of formulating the search requests, An 
interface system of more limited scope may be more 
effective under current clrcumstances than the 
automated ~expert" of the future.
