Abstract 
This paper introduces new specificity 
determining methods for terms based on 
information theoretic measures. The 
specificity of terms represents the quantity of 
domain specific information that is contained 
in the terms. Compositional and contextual   
information of terms are used in proposed 
methods. As the methods don?t rely on domain 
dependent information, they can be applied to 
other domains without extra processes.  
Experiments showed very promising results 
with the precision 82.0% when applied to the 
terms in MeSH thesaurus. 
1 Introduction 
The specificity of terms represents the quantity of 
domain specific information contained in the terms. 
If a term has large quantity of domain specific 
information, the specificity of the term is high. The 
specificity of a term X is quantified to positive real 
number as equation (1). 
( )Spec X R+?                           (1) 
The specificity is a kind of necessary condition 
for term hierarchy, i.e., if X1 is one of ancestors of 
X2, then Spec(X1) is less than Spec(X2). Thus this 
condition can be applied to automatic construction 
or evaluation of term hierarchy. The specificity 
also can be applied to automatic term recognition. 
Many domain specific terms are multiword 
terms. When domain specific concepts are 
represented as multiword terms, the terms are 
classified into two categories based on composition 
of unit words. In the first category, new terms are 
created by adding modifiers to existing terms. For 
example ?insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus? was 
created by adding modifier ?insulin-dependent? to 
its hypernym ?diabetes mellitus? as in Table 1. In 
English, the specific level terms are very 
commonly compounds of the generic level term 
and some modifier (Croft, 2004). In this case, 
compositional information is important to get 
meaning of the terms. In the second category, new 
terms are independent of existing terms. For 
example, ?wolfram syndrome? is semantically 
related to its ancestor terms as in Table 1. But it 
shares no common words with its ancestor terms. 
In this case, contextual information is important to 
get meaning of the terms.

Contextual information has been mainly used to 
represent the meaning of terms in previous works. 
(Grefenstette, 1994) (Pereira, 1993) and 
(Sanderson, 1999) used contextual information to 
find hyponymy relation between terms. (Caraballo, 
1999) also used contextual information to 
determine the specificity of nouns. Contrary, 
compositional information of terms has not been 
commonly discussed. We propose new specificity 
measuring methods based on both compositional 
and contextual information. The methods are 
formulated as information theory like measures. 
This paper consists as follow; new specificity 
measuring methods are introduced in section 2, and 
the experiments and evaluation on the methods are 
discussed in section 3, finally conclusions are 
drawn in section 4. 
2 Specificity Measuring Methods 
In this section, we describe information theory like 
methods to measure the specificity of terms. Here, 
we call information theory like methods, because 
some probability values used in these methods are

not real probability, rather they are relative weight 
of terms or words.  
In information theory, when a low probability 
message occurs on channel output, the quantity of 
surprise is large, and the length of bits to represent 
the message becomes long. Thus the large quantity 
of information is gained by the message (Haykin, 
1994). If we regard the terms in corpus as the 
messages of channel output, the information 
quantity of the terms can be measured using 
information theory. A set of target terms is defined 
as equation (2) for further explanation. 
{ |1 }kT t k n= ? ?                         (2) 
where tk is a term. In next step, a discrete random 
variable X is defined as equation (3). 
{ |1 }   ( ) Prob( )k k kX x k n p x X x= ? ? = =    (3) 
where xk is an event of tk is observed in corpus, 
p(xk) is the probability of xk. The information 
quantity, I(xk), gained after observing xk, is used as 
the specificity of tk as equation (4). 
( ) ( ) log ( )k k kSpec t I x p x? = ?              (4) 
By equation (4), we can measure the specificity 
of tk, by estimating p(xk). We describe three 
estimating methods for p(xk) in following sections. 
2.1 Compositional Information based Method 
(Method 1) 
By compositionality, the meaning of a term can be 
strictly predicted from the meaning of the 
individual words (Manning, 1999). This method is 
divided into two steps: In the first step, the 
specificity of each word is measured independently. 
In the second step, the specificity of composite 
words is summed up. For detail description, we 
assume that tk consists of one or more words as 
equation (5). 
1 2...k mt w w w=                           (5) 
where wi is i-th word in tk. In next step, a discrete 
random variable Y is defined as equation (6). 
{ |1 }   ( ) Prob( )i i iY y i m p y Y y= ? ? = =       (6) 
where yi is an event of wi occurs in term tk, p(yi) is 
the probability of yi. Information quantity, I(xk), in 
equation (4) is redefined as equation (7) based on 
previous assumption. 
1
( ) ( ) log ( )
m
k i i
i
I x p y p y
=
= ??                 (7) 
where I(xk) is average information quantity of all 
words in tk. In this mechanism, p(yi) of informative 
words should be smaller than that of non 
informative words. Two information sources, word 
frequency, tf.idf are used to estimate p(yi)  
independently. 
We assume that if a term is composed of low 
frequency words, the term have large quantity of 
domain information. Because low frequency words 
appear in limited number of terms, they have high 
discriminating ability. On this assumption, p(yi) in 
equation (7) is estimated as relative frequency of wi 
in corpus. In this estimation, P(yi) for low 
frequency words becomes small. 
tf.idf is widely used term weighting scheme in 
information retrieval (Manning, 1999). We assume 
that if a term is composed of high tf.idf words, the 
term have domain specific information. On this 
assumption, p(yi) in equation (7) is estimated as 
equation (8). 
( )( ) ( ) 1

tf idf w
?? = ? ??        (8) 
where tf?idf(w) is tf.idf value of w. In this equation, 
p(yi) of high tf.idf words becomes small. 
If the modifier-head structure is known, the 
specificity of the term is calculated incrementally 
starting from head noun. In this manner, the 
specificity of the term is always larger than that of 
the head term. This result answers to the 
assumption that more specific term has higher 
specificity. We use simple nesting relations 
between terms to analyze modifier-head structure 
as follows (Frantzi, 2000): 
 
Definition 1 If two terms X and Y are terms in 
same semantic category and X is nested in Y as 
W1XW2, then X is head term, and W1 and W2 are 
modifiers of X. 
 
For example, because ?diabetes mellitus? is 
nested in ?insulin dependent diabetes mellitus? and 
two terms are all disease names, ?diabetes 
mellitus? is head term and ?insulin dependent? is 
modifier. The specificity of Y is measured as 
equation (9). 
1 2( ) ( ) ( ) ( )Spec Y Spec X Spec W Spec W? ?= + ? + ?    (9) 
where Spec(X), Spec(W1), and Spec(W2) are the 
specificity of X, W1, W2 respectively. ?  and ?  are 
weighting schemes for the specificity of modifiers. 
They are found by experimentally. 
2.2 Contextual Information based Method 
(Method 2)  
There are some problems that are hard to address 
using compositional information alone. Firstly, 
although two disease names, ?wolfram syndrome? 
and ?insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus?, share 
CompuTerm 2004 Poster Session  -  3rd International Workshop on Computational Terminology88
many common features in semantic level, they 
don?t share any common words in lexical level. In 
this case, it is unreasonable to compare two 
specificity values based on compositional 
information. Secondly, when several words are 
combined into one term, there are additional 
semantic components that are not predicted by unit 
words. For example, ?wolfram syndrome? is a kind 
of ?diabetes mellitus?. We can not predict the 
meaning of ?diabetes mellitus? from two separate 
words ?wolfram? and ?syndrome?. Thus we use 
contextual information to address these problems. 
General terms are frequently modified by other 
words in corpus. Because domain specific terms 
have sufficient information in themselves, they are 
rarely modified by other words, (Caraballo, 1999). 
Under this assumption, we use probability 
distribution of modifiers as contextual information. 
Collecting sufficient modifiers from given corpus 
is very important in this method. To this end, we 
use Conexor functional dependency parser 
(Conexor, 2004) to analyze the structure of 
sentences. Among many dependency functions 
defined in the parser, ?attr? and ?mod? functions 
are used to extract modifiers from analyzed 
structures. This method can be applied the terms 
that are modified by other words in corpus. 
Entropy of modifiers for a term is defined as 
equation (10). 
( ) ( , ) log ( , )mod k i k i k
i
H t p mod t p mod t= ??    (10) 
where p(modi,tk) is the probability of modi modifies 
tk and it is estimated as relative frequency of modi 
in all modifiers of tk. The entropy calculated by 
equation (10) is the average information quantity 
of all (modi,tk) pairs. Because domain specific 
terms have simple modifier distributions, the 
entropy of the terms is low. Therefore inversed 
entropy is assigned to I(xk) in equation (4) to make 
specific terms get large quantity of information. 
1
( ) max( ( )) ( )k mod i mod ki nI x H t H t? ?? ?           (11) 
where the first term of approximation is the 
maximum modifier entropy of all terms. 
2.3 Hybrid Method (Method 3) 
In this section, we describe hybrid method to 
overcome shortcomings of previous two methods. 
In this method the specificity is measured as 
equation (12). 
1( ) 1 1( ) (1 )( )
( ) ( )
k
Cmp k Ctx k
I x
I x I x
? ?
?
+ ?
      (12) 
where ICmp(xk) and ICtx(xk) are information quantity 
measured by method1 and method 2 respectively. 
They are normalized value between 0 and 1. 
(0 1)? ?? ?  is weight of two values. If 0.5? = , the 
equation is harmonic mean of two values. 
Therefore I(xk) becomes large when two values are 
equally large. 
3 Experiments and Evaluation 
In this section, we describe our experiments and 
evaluate proposed methods.  
We select a subtree of MeSH thesaurus for the 
experiment. ?metabolic diseases(C18.452)? node is 
root of the subtree, and the subtree consists of 436 
disease names which are target terms for 
specificity measuring. We used MEDLINE 2 
database corpus (170,000 abstracts, 20,000,000 
words) to extract statistical information. 
Each method was evaluated by two criteria, 
coverage and precision. Coverage is the fraction of 
the terms which have the specificity by given 
method. Method 2 gets relatively lower coverage 
than method 1, because method 2 can measure the 
specificity only when both the terms and their 
modifiers occur in corpus. Method 1 can measure 
the specificity whenever parts of composite words 
appear in corpus. Precision is the fraction of 
correct specificity relations values as equation (13). 
#   ( , )   
#    ( , )
of R p c with correct specificityp
of all R p c
=   (13) 
where R(p,c) is a parent-child relation in MeSH 
thesaurus. If child term c has larger specificity than 
that of parent term p, then the relation is said to 
have correct specificity. We divided parent-child 
relations into two types. Relations where parent 
term is nested in child term are categorized as type 
I. Other relations are categorized as type II. There 
are 43 relations in type I and 393 relations in type 
II. The relations in type I always have correct 
specificity provided modifier-head information 
method described in section 2.1 is applied. 
We tested prior experiment for 10 human 
subjects to find out the upper bound of precision. 
The subjects are all medical doctors of internal 
medicine, which is closely related division to 
?metabolic diseases?. They were asked to identify 
parent-child relationship for given term pairs. The 
average precisions of type I and type II were 
96.6% and 86.4% respectively. We set these values 
as upper bound of precision for suggested methods.

serviced by National Library of Medicine, USA. 
(http://www.nlm.nih.gov) 
CompuTerm 2004 Poster Session  -  3rd International Workshop on Computational Terminology 89
The specificity of terms was measured with 
method 1, method 2, and method 3 as Table 2. 
Two additional methods, based on term frequency 
and term tf.idf, were experimented to compare 
compositionality based methods and term based 
methods. 
Method 1 showed better performance than term 
based methods. This result illustrate basic 
assumption of this paper that specific concepts are 
created by adding information to existing concepts, 
and new concepts are expressed as new terms by 
adding modifiers to existing terms. Word tf.idf 
based method showed better precision than word 
frequency based method. This result illustrate that 
tf.idf of words is more informative than frequency 
of words. 
Method 3 showed the best precision, 82.0%, 
because the two methods interacted 
complementary. In hybrid method, the weight 
value 0.8? =  indicates that compositional 
information is more informative than contextual 
information for the specificity of domain specific 
terms.  
One reason of the errors is that the names of 
some internal nodes in MeSH thesaurus are 
category names rather disease names. For example, 
as ?acid-base imbalance (C18.452.076)? is name 
of disease category, it doesn't occur as frequently 
as other real disease names. Other predictable 
reason is that we didn?t consider various surface 
forms of same term. For example, although 
?NIDDM? is acronym of ?non insulin dependent 
diabetes mellitus?, the system counted two terms 
separately. Therefore the extracted statistics can?t 
properly reflect semantic level information. 
4 Conclusion 
This paper proposed specificity measuring 
methods for terms based on information theory like 
measures using compositional and contextual 
information of terms. The methods are 
experimented on the terms in MeSH thesaurus. 
Hybrid method showed the best precision of 82.0%, 
because two methods complemented each other. 
As the proposed methods don't use domain 
dependent information, they can be adapted to 
other domains without extra processes. 
In the future, we will modify the system to 
handle various term formations such as abbreviated 
form. Finally we will apply the proposed methods 
to the terms of other specific domains.
