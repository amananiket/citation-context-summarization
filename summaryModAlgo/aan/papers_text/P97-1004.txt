Abst ract  
A system for the automatic production of 
controlled index terms is presented using 
linguistically-motivated techniques. This 
includes a finite-state part of speech tagger, 
a derivational morphological processor for 
analysis and generation, and a unification- 
based shallow-level parser using transfor- 
mational rules over syntactic patterns. The 
contribution of this research is the success- 
ful combination of parsing over a seed term 
list coupled with derivational morphology 
to achieve greater coverage of multi-word 
terms for indexing and retrieval. Final re- 
sults are evaluated for precision and recall, 
and implications for indexing and retrieval 
are discussed. 
1 Mot ivat ion  
Terms are known to be excellent descriptors of the 
informational content of textual documents (Sriniva- 
san, 1996), but they are subject o numerous linguis- 
tic variations. Terms cannot be retrieved properly 
with coarse text simplification techniques (e.g. stem- 
ming); their identification requires precise and effi- 
cient NLP techniques. We have developed a domain 
independent system for automatic term recognition 
from unrestricted text. The system presented in this 
paper takes as input a list of controlled terms and 
a corpus; it detects and marks occurrences of term 
We would like to thank the NLP Group of Columbia 
University, Bell Laboratories - Lucent Technologies, and

Scientifique t Technique (INIST-CNRS) for providing 
us with the agricultural corpus and the associated term 
list, and Didier Bourigault for providing us with terms

variants within the corpus. The system takes as in- 
put a precompiled (automatically or manually) term 
list, and transforms it dynamically into a more com- 
plete term list by adding automatically generated 
variants. This method extends the limits of term 
extraction as currently practiced in the IR commu- 
nity: it takes into account multiple morphological 
and syntactic ways linguistic concepts are expressed 
within language. Our approach is a unique hybrid 
in allowing the use of manually produced precom- 
piled data as input, combined with fully automatic 
computational methods for generating term expan- 
sions. Our results indicate that we can expand term 
variations at least 30% within a scientific orpus. 
2 Background and  In t roduct ion  
NLP techniques have been applied to extraction 
of information from corpora for tasks such as free 
indexing (extraction of descriptors from corpora), 
(Metzler and Haas, 1989; Schwarz, 1990; Sheridan 
and Smeaton, 1992; Strzalkowski, 1996), term ac- 
quisition (Smadja and McKeown, 1991; Bourigault, 
1993; Justeson and Katz, 1995; Dallle, 1996), or ex- 
traction of lin9uistic information e.g. support verbs 
(Grefenstette and Teufel, 1995), and event structure 
of verbs (Klavans and Chodorow, 1992). 
Although useful, these approaches suffer from two 
weaknesses which we address. First is the issue of 
filtering term lists; this has been dealt with by cons- 
traints on processing and by post-processing over- 
generated lists. Second is the problem of difficulties 
in identifying related terms across parts of speech. 
We address these limitations through the use of con- 
trolled indexing, that is, indexing with reference to 
previously available authoritative t rms lists, such as 
(NLM, 1995). Our approach is fully automatic, but 
permits effective combination of available resources 
(such as thesauri) with language processing techno- 
logy, i.e., morphology, part-of-speech tagging, and 
syntactic analysis. 
24 
Automatic ontrolled indexing is a more difficult 
task than it may seem at first glance: 
? controlled indexing on single-words must 
account for polysemy and word disambiguation 
(Krovetz and Croft, 1992; Klavans, 1995). 
? controlled indexing on multi-word terms must 
consider the numerous forms of term va- 
riations (Dunham, Pacak, and Pratt, 1978; 
Sparck Jones and Tait, 1984; Jacquemin, 1996). 
We focus here on the multi-word task. Our 
system exploits a morphological processor and a 
transformation-based parser for the extraction of 
multi-word controlled indexes. 
The action of the system is twofold. First, a cor- 
pus is enriched by tagging each word unambiguously, 
and then expanded by linking each word with all its 
possible derivatives. For example, for English, the 
word genes is tagged as a plural noun and morpho- 
logically connected to genic, genetic, genome, ge- 
notoxic, genetically, etc. Second, the term list is 
dynamically expanded through syntactic transfor- 
mations which allow the retrieval of term variants. 
For example, genic expressions, genes were expres- 
sed, expression of this gene, etc. are extracted as 
variants of gene expression. 
This system relies on a full-fledged unification for- 
malism and thus is well adapted to a fine-grained 
identification of terms related in syntactically and 
morphologically complex ways. The same system 
has been effectively applied both to English and 
French, although this paper focuses on French (see 
(Jacquemin, 1994) for the case of syntactic variants 
in English). All evaluation experiments were perfor- 
med on two corpora: a training corpus \[ECI\] (ECI, 
1989 and 1990) used for the tuning of the metagram- 
mar and a test corpus \[AGR\] (AGR, 1995) used for 
evaluation. \[ECI\] is a subset of the European Corpus 
Initiative data composed of 1.3 million words of the 
French newspaper "Le Monde"; \[AGR\] is a set of 
abstracts of scientific papers in the agricultural do- 
main from INIST/CNRS (1.1 million words). A list 
of terms is associated with each corpus: the terms 
corresponding to \[ECI\] were automatically extrac- 
ted by LEXTER (Bourigault, 1993) and the terms 
corresponding to \[AGR\] were extracted from the 
AGROVOC term list owned by INIST/CNRS. 
The following section describes methods for grou- 
ping multi-word term variants; Section 4 presents 
a linguistically-motivated method for lexical analy- 
sis (inflectional analysis, part of speech tagging, and 
derivational analysis); Section 5 explains term ex- 
pansion methods: constructions with a local parse 
through syntactic transformations preserving depen- 
dency relations; Section 6 illustrates the empirical 
tuning of linguistic rules; Section 7 presents an eva- 
luation of the results in terms of precision and recall. 
3 Var ia t ion  in  Mu l t i -Word  Terms:  A 
Descr ip t ion  o f  the  Prob lem 
Linguistic variation is a major concern in the studies 
on automatic indexing. Variations can be classified 
into three major categories: 
? Syntact ic  (Type 1): the content words of 
the original term are found in the variant but 
the syntactic structure of the term is modified, 
e.g. technique for performing volumetric mea- 
surements i a Type 1 variant of measurement 
technique. 
? Morpho-syntaet ic  (Type  2): the content 
words of the original term or one of their deri- 
vatives are found in the variant. The syntactic 
structure of the term is also modified, e.g. ele- 
ctrophoresed on a neutral polyaerylamide gel is 
a Type 2 variant of gel electrophoresis. 
? Semant ic  (Type 3): synonyms are found in 
the variant; the structure may be modified, e.g. 
kidney function is a Type 3 variant of renal fun- 
ction. 
This paper deals with Type 1 and Type 2 variations. 
The two main approaches to multi-word term con- 
flation in IR are text simplification and structural 
similarity. Text simplification refers to traditional 
IR algorithms uch as (1) deletion of stop words, 
(2) normalization ofsingle words through stemming, 
and (3) phrase construction through dictionary mat- 
ching. (See (Lewis, Croft, and Bhandaru, 1989; 
Smeaton, 1992) on the exploitation of NLP tech- 
niques in IR.) These methods are generally limited. 
The morphological complexity of the language seems 
to be a decisive argument for performing rich stem- 
ming (Popovi~ and Willett, 1992). Since we focus 
on French, a language with a rich declensional infle- 
ctional and derivational morphology--we have cho- 
sen the richest and most precise morphological na- 
lysis. This is a key component in the recognition 
of Type 2 variants. For structural similarity, co- 
arse dependency-based NLP methods do not account 
for fine structural relations involved in Type 1 va- 
riants. For instance, properties of flour should be 
linked to flour properties, properties of wheat flour 
but not to properties of flour starch (examples are 
from (Schwarz, 1990)). The last occurrence must be 
rejected because starch is the argument of the head 
25 
noun properties, whereas flour is the argument of 
the head noun properties in the original term. Wi- 
thout careful structural disambiguation ver internal 
phrase structure, these important syntactic distinc- 
tions would be incorrectly overlooked. 
4 Par t  o f  Speech  D isambiguat ion  
and  Morpho logy  
First, inf lect ional morpho logy  is performed in or- 
der to get the different analyses of word forms. Infle- 
ctional morphology is implemented with finite-state 
transducers on the model used for Spanish (Tzouker- 
mann and Liberman, 1990). The theoretical prin- 
ciples underlying this approach are based on gene- 
rative morphology (Aronoff, 1976; Selkirk, 1982). 
The system consists of precomputing stems, extrac- 
ted from a large dictionary of French (Boyer, 1993) 
enhanced with newspaper corpora, a total of over 
85,000 entries. 
Second, a f in i te-state par t  of speech tagger  
(Tzoukermann, Radev, and Gale, 1995; Tzouker- 
mann and Radev, 1996) performs the morpho- 
syntactic disambiguation f words. The tagger takes 
the output of inflectional morphological nalysis and 
through a combination of linguistic and statistical 
techniques, outputs a unique part of speech for each 
word in context. Reducing the ambiguity of part of 
speech tags eliminates ambiguity in local parsing. 
Furthermore, part of speech ambiguity resolution 
permits construction of correct derivational links. 
Third, der ivat iona l  morpho logy  (Tzoukermann 
and Jacquemin, 1997) is achieved to generate mor- 
phological variants of the disambiguated words. De- 
rivational generation is performed on the lemmas 
produced by the inflectional analysis and the part of 
speech information. Productive stripping and con- 
catenation rules are applied on lemmas. 
The derived forms are expressed as tokens with 
feature structures 1. For instance, the following set 
of constraints express that the noun modernisateur is 
morphologically related to the word modernisation 2 . 
The <ON> metarule removes the -ion suffix, and 
the <EUR> rule adds the nominal suffix -eur. 
1In the remainder of the paper, N is Noun, A 
Adjective, C Coordinating conjunction, D Determiner, 
P Preposition, Av Adverb, Pu Punctuation, NP Noun 
Phrase, and AP Adjective Phrase. 
2Each lemma has a unique numeric identifier 
<reference>. 
<cat> =- N 
<lemma> =- 'modernisation' 
<reference> = 52663 
<derivation cat> -- N 
<derivation lemma> = 'modernisateur' 
<derivation reference> = 52662 
<derivation history> -- '<ON<>EUR>' .  
The morphological analysis performed in this 
study is detailed in (Tzoukermann, Klavans, and 
Jacquemin, 1997). It is more complete and linguis- 
tically more accurate than simple stemming for the 
following reasons: 
? Allomorphy is accounted for by listing the set 
of its possible allomorphs for each word. A1- 
lomorphies are obtained through multiple verb 
stems, e.g. \]abriqu-, \]abric- (fabricate) or addi- 
tional allomorphic rules. 
? Concatenation of several suffixes is accounted 
for by rule ordering mechanisms. Furthermore, 
we have devised a method for guessing possible 
suffix combinations from a lexicon and a corpus. 
This empirical method reported in (Jacquemin, 
1997) ensures that suffixes which are related wi- 
thin specific domains are considered. 
? Derivational morphology is built with the pers- 
pective of overgeneration. The nature of the se- 
mantic links between a word and its derivational 
forms is not checked and all allomorphic alter- 
nants are generated. Selection of the correct 
links occurs during subsequent term expansion 
process with collocational filtering. Although 
dtable (cowshed) is incorrectly related to dtablir 
(to establish), it is very improbable to find a 
context where dtablir co-occurs with one of the 
three words found in the three multi-word terms 
containing dtable: nettoyeur (cleaner), alimen- 
ration (feeding), and liti~re (litter): Since we 
focus on multi-word term variants, overgenera- 
tion does not present a problem in our system. 
5 T rans format ion -Based  Term 
Expans ion  
The extraction of terms and their variants from cor- 
pora is performed by a unification-based parser. The 
controlled terms are transformed into grammar rules 
whose syntax is similar to PATR-I I .  
5.1 A Corpus -Based  Method  for 
Discover ing Syntact ic  T rans format ions  
We present a method for inferring transformations 
from a corpus in the purpose of developing a gram- 
26 
mar of syntactic transformations for term variants. 
To discover the families of term variants, we first 
consider a notion of collocation which is less restri- 
ctive than variation. Then, we refine this notion in 
order to filter out genuine variants and to reject spu- 
rious ones. A Type 1 collocation of a binary term 
is a text window containing its content words wl 
and w2, without consideration of the syntactic stru- 
cture. With such a definition, any Type 1 variant is 
a Type 1 collocation. Similarly, a notion of Type 2 
collocation is defined based on the co-occurence of 
wl and w2 including their derivational relatives. 
A d=5-word window is considered as sufficient for 
detecting collocations in English (Martin, A1, and 
Van Sterkenburg, 1983). We chose a window-size 
twice as large because French is a Romance language 
with longer syntactic structures due to the absence 
of compounding, and because we want to be sure 
to observe structures panning over large textual se- 
quences. For example, the term perte au stockage 
(storage loss) is encountered in the \[AGR\] corpus as: 
pertes occasionndes par les insectes au sorgho stockd 
(literally: loss of stored sorghum due to the insects). 
A linguistic classification of the collocations which 
are correct variants brings up the following families 
of variations a.
? Type  1 var iat ions  are classified according to 
their syntactic stucture. 
1. Coord inat ion :  a coordination the combi- 
nation of two terms with a common head 
word or a common argument. Thus, fruits 
et agrumes tropicaux (literally: tropical ci- 
trus fruits or fruits) is a coordination va- 
riant of the term fruits tropicaux (tropical 
fruits). 
2. Subst i tu t ion /Mod i f i ca t ion :  a substitu- 
tion is the replacement of a content word 
by a term; a modification is the insertion 
of a modifier without reference to another 
term. For example, activitd thermodyna- 
mique de l'eau (thermodynamic a tivity of 
water) is a substitution variant of activitg 
de l'eau (activity of water) if activitd ther- 
modynamique (thermodynamic a tivity) is 
a term; otherwise, it is a modification. 
3. Compound ing /Decompound ing :  in 
French, most terms have a compound noun 
structure, i.e. a noun phrase structure 
where determiners are omitted such as con- 
sommation d'oxyg~ne (oxygen consump- 
tion). The decompounding variation is the

riants are transformations of terms by these functions. 
transformation of a term with a compound 
structure into a noun phrase structure such 
as consommation de l'oxyg~ne (consump- 
tion of the oxygen). Compounding is the 
reciprocal transformation. 
? Type  2 var iat ions are classified according to 
the nature of the morphological derivation. Of- 
ten semantic shifts are involved as well (Viegas, 
Gonzalez, and Longwell, 1996). 
1. Noun-Noun var iat ions:  relations such 
as result/agent (fixation de l'azote (ni- 
trogen fixation) / fixateurs d ' azote (nitrogen 
fixater)) or container/content (rdservoir 
d ' eau (water eservoir) / rdserve en eau (wa- 
ter reserve)) are found in this family. 
2. Noun-Verb  var iat ions:  these variations 
often involve semantic shifts such as pro- 
cess/result fixation de l'azote/fixer l'azote 
(to fix nitrogen). 
3. Noun-Ad jec t ive  var iat ions:  the two 
ways to modify a noun, a prepositional 
phrase or an adjectival phrase, are gene- 
rally semantically equivalent, e.g. variation 
du climat (climate variation) is a synonym 
of variation climatique (climatic variation). 
A method for term variant extraction based on 
morphology and simple co-occurrences would be 
very imprecise. A manual observation ofcollocations 
shows that only 55% of the Type 1 collocations are 
correct Type 1 variants and that only 52% of the 
Type 2 collocations are correct Type 2 variants. It 
is therefore necessary to conceive a filtering method 
for rejecting fortuitous co-occurrences. The follo- 
wing section proposes a filtering system based on 
syntactic patterns. 
6 Empi r i ca l  Ru le  Tun ing  
6.1 Syntact ic  T rans format ions  for Type  1 
and Type 2 var iants  
The concept of a grammar of syntactic transforma- 
tions is motivated by well-known observations on the 
behavior of collocations in context (e.g. (Harris et 
al., 1989).) Initial rules based on surface syntax are 
refined through incremental experimental tuning. 
We have devised a grammar of French to serve as a 
basis for the creation of metarules for term variants. 
For example, the noun phrase expansion rule is4: 
NP -~ D: AP*N (APIPP)*  (1) 
awe use UNIX regular expression symbols for rules 
and transformations. 
27 
From this rule a set of expansions can be generated: 
NP = D ? (Av ? A)* N (Av ? A I (2) 
P D ? (Av ? A)* N (Av ? A)*)* 
In order to balance completeness and accuracy, ex- 
pansions are limited. After the initial expansion is 
created for a range of structures, empirical tuning is 
applied to create a set of maximum coverage meta- 
rules. 
We briefly illustrate this process for coordina- 
tion. For this example, we restrict ransformations 
to terms with N P N structures which represent a full 
33% of the binary terms. Examples of metarules of 
Type 1 and Type 2 variations are given in Table 1. 
6.2 Deve lopment  of  a Coord inat ion  
Trans format ion  for N P N Terms 
The coordination types are first calculated by combi- 
ning the pattern N1 P2 Ns with possible expansions 
of a noun phrase with a simple paradigmatic struc- 
ture A TN(A IPD ? A ?NAT)s: 
Coord(N1 P2 Ns) = N1 ((C A T N A T P) I (3) 
(A C P) I (P D? AT N A T C P?)) N3 
The first parenthesis (C A T N A ? P) represents a 
coordinated head noun, the second (A C P) and 
third (P D ? A T N A T C P?) represent respectively 
an adjective phrase and a prepositional phrase coor- 
dinated with the prepositional phrase of the original 
term. 
Variants were extracted on the \[ECI\] corpus 
through this transformation; the following observa- 
tions and changes have been made. 
First, coordination accepts a substitution which 
replaces the noun N3 with a noun phrase D ? A T Ns. 
For example, the variant tempdrature t humiditd 
initiale de Pair (temperature and initial humidity of 
the air) is a coordination where a determiner pre- 
cedes the last noun (air). 
Secondly, the observations of coordination va- 
riants also suggest that the coordinating conjunction 
can be preceded by an optional comma and followed 
by an optional adverb, e.g. la production, et sur- 
tout  la diffusion des semences (the production, and 
part icu lar ly  the distribution of the seeds). 
Thirdly, variants such as de l'humiditd et de la 
vitesse de l'air (literally: of humidity and of  the 
speed of the air) indicate that the conjunction can be 
followed by an optional preposition and an optional 
determiner. 
5Subscripts represent indexing. 
The three preceding changes are made on the ex- 
pression of (3) and the resulting transformation is 
given in the first line of Table 1 (changes are under- 
lined). 
Our empirical selection of valid metarules i  gui- 
ded by linguistic considerations and corpus observa- 
tions. This mode of grammar conception has led us 
to the following decisions: 
? reject linguistic phenomena which could not be 
accounted for by regular expressions uch as 
sentential complements of nouns; 
? reject noisy and inaccurate variations uch as 
long distance dependencies ( pecifically within 
a verb phrase); 
? focus on productive and safe variations which 
are felicitously represented in our framework. 
Accounting for variants which are not considered in 
our framework would require the conception of a no- 
vel framework, probably in cooperation with a dee- 
per analyzer. It is unlikely that our transformatio- 
nal approach with regular expressions could do much 
better than the results presented here. Table 2 shows 
some variants of AGROVOC terms extracted from 
the \[AGR\] corpus. 
7 Eva luat ion  
The precision and recall of the extraction of term va- 
riants are given in Table 4 where precision is the ra- 
tio of correct variants among the variants extracted 
and the recall is the ratio of variants retrieved among 
the collocates. Results were obtained through a ma- 
nual inspection of 1,579 Type 1 variants, 823 Type 2 
variants, 3,509 Type 1 collocates, and 2,104 Type 2 
collocates extracted from the \[AGR\] corpus and the 
AGROVOC term list. 
These results indicate a very high level of accu- 
racy: 89.4% of the variants extracted by the system 
are correct ones. Errors generally correspond to a se- 
mantic discrepancy between a word and its morpho- 
logically derived form. For example, dlevde pour un 
sol (literally: high for a soil) is not a correct variant 
of dlevage hors sol (off-soil breeding) because dlevde 
and dlevage are morphologically related to two dif- 
ferent senses of the verb dlever:, dlevde derives from 
the meaning to raise whereas dlevage derives from to 
breed. Recall is weaker than precision because only 
75.2% of the possible variants are retrieved. 
Improvement  of  Index ing through Var iant  
Ext rac t ion  
For a better understanding of the importance of 
term expansion, we now compare term indexing with

and without variant expansion. The \[AGR\] corpus 
has been indexed with the AGROVOC thesaurus in
two different ways: 
1. Simple indexing: Extraction of occurrences of
multi-word terms without considering variation. 
2. Rich indexing: Simple indexing improved with 
the extraction of variants of multi-word terms. 
Both indexings have been manually checked. Simple 
indexing is almost error-free but does not cover term 
variants. On the contrary, rich indexing is slightly 
less accurate but recall is much higher. Both me- 
thods are compared by calculating the effectiveness 
measure (Van Rijsbergen, 1975): 
1 
E~=l -a (_~)+( l _a ) ( _~)  w i th0<a<l  (4) 
P and R are precision and recall and a is a para- 
meter which is close to 1 if precision is preferred to 
recall. The value of E~ varies from 0 to 1; E~ is 
close to 0 when all the relevant conflations are made 
and when no incorrect one is made. 
The effectiveness of rich indexing is more than 
three times better than effectiveness of simple in- 
dexing. Retrieved variants increase the number 
Table 3: Evaluation of Simple vs. Rich Indexing. 
Precision Recall Eo.s 
Simple indexing 99 .7% 72.4% 16.1% 
Rich indexing 97.2% 93.4% 4.7% 
of indexing items by 28.8% (17.3% Type 1 va- 
riants and 11.5% Type 2 variants). Thus, term va- 
riant extraction is a significant expansion factor for 
identifying morphologically and syntactically related 
multi-word terms in a document without introducing 
undesirable noise. 
As for performance, the parser is fast enough for 
processing large amounts of textual data due to the 
presence of several optimization devices. On a Pen- 
tium133 with Linux, the parser processes 18,100 
words/min from an initial list of 4,300 terms. 
Conclusion 
This paper has proposed a syntax-based approach 
via morphologically derived forms for the identifi- 
cation and extraction of multi-word term variants.

In using a list of controlled terms coupled with a 
syntactic analyzer, the method is more precise than 
traditional text simplification methods. Iterative x- 
perimental tuning has resulted in wide-coverage lin- 
guistic description i corporating the most frequent 
linguistic phenomena. 
Evaluations indicate that, by accounting for term 
variation using corpus tagging, morphological deri- 
vation, and transformation-based rules, 28.8% more 
can be identified than with a traditional indexer 
which cannot account for variation. Applications to 
be explored in future research involve the incorpo- 
ration Of the system as part of the indexing module 
of an IR system, to be able to accurately measure 
improvements in system coverage as well as areas of 
possible degradation. We also plan to explore analy- 
sis of semantic variants through apredicative r pre- 
sentation of term semantics. Our results o far indi- 
cate that using computational linguistic techniques 
for carefully controlled term expansion will permit 
at least a three-fold expansion for coverage over tra- 
ditional indexing, which should improve retrieval re- 
suits accordingly.
