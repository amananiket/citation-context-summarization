ABSTRACT 
In the pro ject  "P rocedura l  D ia logue  
Mode ls"  be ing car r ied  on at the Un ivers i ty  
of B ie le fe ld  we have deve loped an Incre- 
menta l  mu l t i l eve l  pars ing  fo rmal i sm to 
reconst ruct  task -or iented  d ia logues .  A 
major  d i f f i cu l ty  we have had to overcome 
is that the d ia logues  are real ones w i th  
numerous  ungrammatical ut terances .  The 
approach  we have dev ised  to cope wi th  this 
p rob lem is repor ted  here. 
I THE INCREMENTAL,  MULT ILEVEL  PARSING 
FORMALISM 
In recent  NLU-sys tems a major  impor-  
tance is lald on process ing  non-s tandard  
input . l )  The present  paper  reports  on the 
exper iences  we have made in the pro ject  
"P rocedura l  D ia logue  Mode ls"  reconst ruc -  
t ing task~or iented  d ia logues ,  wh ich  were 
u t tered  in a rather  co l loqu ia l  German.2)  
To this aim we have deve loped an incre- 
menta l  mu l t i l eve l  pars ing  fo rmal i sm (Chri-  
s ta l le r /Metz lng  82, Gehrke 82, Gehrke 83), 
based on an  extens ion  of the concept  of 
cascaded ATNs (Woods 80). This fo rmal i sm 
(see fig. A) o rgan izes  the in teract ion  of 
severa l  independent  process ing  components ,  
in our case 5. The process ing  components  
need not be ATNs; it is up to the user  of 
the fo rmal i sm to choose  the tool  for the 
spec i f i c  task that sui ts  her /h lm best.

bone l l  83, Kwasny  80, 'Sondhe imer /Wei -

et al 83. 
2) The d ia logues  that we are work ing  wi th  
were recorded in the City of F rankfur t /  
Main  (K le in  79). 
The f i rst  level ,  an ATN, is respons ib le  
for the syntact i c  ana lys i s .  Its ma in  put ~ 
pose is to detect  phrases  as wel l  as wh~ 
and imperat ive  s t ruc tures  and to determine  
the syntact i c  s ta tus  a phrase  may have in 
the u t terance .  On this leve l  the ana lys i s  
of an u t terance  can reach a permiss ib le  
f ina l  s tate  even if there is no complete  
sentence  s t ruc ture  der ived .  The dec is ion ,  
if permiss ib le  or not, is made on the 
pragmat ic  level .  
The semant ic  in terpretat ion  is car r ied  
out by a case-or iented  product ion  rule 
sys tem.  Accord ing  to the incrementa l  man- 
ner of p rocess ing  there are two def in i  ~ 
t ions of case s lots:  
i. a genera l  one for a tentat ive  categor i -  
za t ion  of phrases  before  the main  verb 
is detected ,  and 
2. a spec i f i c  one, connected  wi th  the 
respect ive  verb  frame. 
This  double  de f in i t ion  of case s lots  en- 
ab les  the pars ing  fo rmal i sm to make a 
min imal  in terpretat ion  of parts of the 
u t terance  in the case of a miss ing  verb  
and thus g ives  suggest ions  for f i l l ing  
this gap. 
The QUEST ION-ANSWER- INTERACTION~compo~ 
nent is an ATN. It has to categor i ze  an 
ut terance  as a quest ion ,  a part of an 
answer  or as communicat ion  mainta in ing  
categor ies  such as assurance ,  conf i rmat ion  
etc.  This component  is a lso respons ib le  
for recogn iz ing  a d ia logue  w i th in  in a 
d ia logue  when e.g. some c la r i f i ca t ion  on 
that d ia logue  takes place.  
F ina l ly  the TASK-COMMUNICAT ION-compo-  
nent is i tsel f  a two- leve l  cascade.  One 
stage, the TASK- INTERACTION-component ,  
p rov ides  the fo rmal i sm with  a d ia logue  
scheme that p resumably  is app l i cab le  to 
most  types of in fo rmat ion -g iv ing  d ia lo-  
gues. The other  stage, the TASK-SPECIF ICA-  
T ION-component ,  is respons ib le  for the

task -spec i f i c  ca tegor i za t ion ,  in this case 
d i rec t ion  g iv ing  w i th  categor ies  such as 
route descr ip t ion  or p lace descr ip t ion .  We 
d iv ided  this component  into two stages 
wh ich  are both rea l i zed  as ATNs, 
I. in order  to have a greater  modu lar i za -  
t ion between d i f fe rent  components  (pro- 
cess ing o ther  types of task -or iented  
d ia logues  may requ i re  on ly  to change 
the TASK-SPECIF ICAT ION-component  on the 
pragmat ic  leve l . ) ,  and 
2. because  each leve l  cont r ibutes  one 
category  to the u t terance  or a part of 
it, wh ich  avoids  doub le  categor i za t ions  
at one level .  
The pragmat ic  components  are suppor ted  
by knowledge sources  (KS) that hold for 
each par t i c ipant  about  his knowledge of 
the wor ld,  the par tner  and the course  of 
the d ia logue  dependent  of the task. The 
process ing  components  exchange their  re- 
su l ts  v ia  a common KS  (a kind of a black- 
board) .  Only cont ro l  in fo rmat ion  is trans- 
mi t ted  by the cascade.  The pars ing  forma- 
l ism is wr i t ten  in MacL ISP  and in FLAVORS 
(d iP r imio /Chr fs ta l le r  83) - an object -  
o r iented  language embedded in MacLISP.  
II The D ia logue  Corpus 
The d ia logues  that we are dea l ing  wi th  
are real task -or iented  d ia logues .  The 
major i ty  of u t te rances  in these d ia logues  
conta in  non-s tandard  const ruct ions  or are 
in some sense incomplete .  There  are dia- 
lect words,  word  dup l i ca t ions ,  se l f - cor -  
rec t ions  and in ter jec t ions .  On the other  
hand they do not conta in  compl ica ted  sen- 
tence s t ruc tures  such as subord inat ions ,  
complex  noun-phrases ,  etc.  The t rans la t ion  
of one of our  d ia logues  (see fig. B) may 
g ive a l i t t le  impress ion  of these non- 
s tandard  features .  
An ext reme approach  to the so lu t ion  of 
the prob lem of non-s tandard  u t terances  
wou ld  be, in our case, to take the d ia lo  ~ 
gues in the corpus  as they are as stan ~ 
dard.  But this would  only be an ad ho~ 
so lu t ion ,  lack ing  genera l i ty .  Thus we 
burden  the pragmat ic  components  w i th  the 
dec is ion  whether  an u t terance  is accept -  
ab le  or not. 
III HANDLING OF NON-STANDARDS ON THE 
WORD LEVEL 
Dia lect  words are hand led  as words of 
the s tandard  speech,  i.e. they occur  in 
the lex icon.  Dup l i ca t ion  of words is re- 
cogn ized  dur ing  the read process  t ~heTc~e 
actua l  word is compared  wi th  its predeces-  
sor. If they are ident ica l  and if they 
be long only to one syntact i c  category ,  
then the next word is p rocessed  d i rect ly .  
Otherwise  a f lag is set, s ta t ing  that 
there is poss ib ly  a dup l i ca t ion  of words 
to ana lyse .  Such words are ana lysed  as 
usual ,  but the syntact i c  category  of the 
predecess ing  word may not be used. This  
cond i t ion  may cause a new problem,  namely  
X: Could You p lease tel l  me, how I can come to the old opera? to 
y: What? 
X: the old opera 
y: to the old opera;  s t ra ight  ahead,  yes. Come on, I show 
X: yes, yes (I0 sec. pause)  
Y: it to you. ahead to the Kaufhof .  To the 
X: yes 
Y: r ight  there is the Kaufhof ,  isn't  it? and there you stay on the 
X: yes, the eh 
Y: r ight  side, s t ra ight  on through the F ressgass"  it is new 
X: eh mhm 
Y: it 's just in a new shape, the F ressgass ' ,  yes then you wi l l  
X: thank you 
Y: reach d i rec t ly  the opera square,  that is the opera ruin. 
X: very  much. 
Y: 
Fig. B: a sample  t rans la t ion  
185 
when a par t i c ip ia l  const ruct ion  occurs  
w i th in  a noun-phrase ,  e.g. "die die Stras-  
se ueberquerende Frau".  Comparab le  to this 
p rob lem are const ruct ions  in Eng l i sh  that 
begin  w i th  " that  that ...". Luck i ly  such 
const ruct ions  do not occur  in our corpus , 
but this p rob~lem has to be kept  in mind.  
If the ana lys i s  runs into an error ,  then 
the s ta tus  quo ante  is reestab l i shed  and 
the ac tua l  word is d l scarded  as a dup l i ca -  
t ion. 
Cases of se l f - cor rec t lon  on the word 
level ,  when a word  is rep laced  by another  
word of the same syntact i c  category  or the 
same word w i th  an a l te red  in f lec t ion ,  are 
recogn ized  dur ing  the read process  as 
wel l .  They can be t reated  in a s imi la r  way 
w i th  the d i f fe rence  being,  that the pre- 
ceed ing  word is d i scarded  and the d i f fe  * 
r ing features  of the ac tua l  word are taken 
but no ru les are w i thout  except ions .  The 
rare case of two suceed ing  nouns,  e.g. in 
p roper  names (names of s t reets  or bui l -  
d ings)  is captured  in the lex icon,  wh i le  
g roups  of p repos i t ions  or adverbs  are 
permiss ib le .  
IV HANDLING OF INCOMPLETE UTTERANCES 
To hand le  u t terances  that are in some 
sense incomplete  we have the great  advan ~ 
rage that they have been ut tered  in a 
spec i f i c  context .  A l ingu is t i c  ana lys i s  of 
the d ia logues  shows fur theron  that some 
types of answers ,  espec ia l l y  route des ~ 
c r ip t ions  und par t ia l  goal  determinat ions ,  
have a pre ference  for be ing e l l ip t i f i ca t -  
ed. In the cases ment ioned  the degree  of 
e l l lp t i f i ca t ion  ranges  f rom omi t t ing  the 
facu l ta t ive  SOURCE case slot to omi t t ing  
the AGENT case slot up to u t te r ing  only a 
GOAL case slot.  
Due to the incrementa l  manner  o6 par ~ 
sing, as soon as a par t ia l  ana lys i s  of an 
u t terance  is obta ined  the SEMANTIC-compo-  
nent  is t r iggered .  There  a phrase is ten 4 
ta t ive ly  categor i zed ,  depend ing  on case 
markers  (ending,  p repos i t ion) ;  aux i l i a ry  
verbs  mark  tense or mood,  etc.  Some deic-  
t ic adverbs  such as "h ier"  ( "here")  could  
act as a SOURCE case slot for MOVE-verbs .  
Categor i zed  phrases  are sent to the QUEST-  
ION-ANSWER- INTERACTION-component .  
When the end of an u t terance  is recog- 
n ized (sentence  markers ;  co lons  can act as 
end markers  too), then the SEMANTIC-compo-  
nent  tests for complet ion .  If a ma in  verb  
and/or  a ob l igatory  case slot is miss ing ,  
then a procedure  is t r iggered  to f i l l  this 
gap. This in fe rence  procedure  fir~:t in- 
spects  the ac tua l  s ta tes  of the pragmat ic  
components  to gather  in fo rmat ion  as to 
wh ich  categor ies  they expect  next and 
wether  the par t ia l  ana lys i s  f i ts into the 
requ i rements  of the respect ive  category .  
This  in fo rmat ion  is then used by var ious  
in fe rence  ru les to f ix the miss ing  verb or 
case slot.  
Let us cons ider  some examples :  
i. "vor  bis zum Kaufhof . "  ( "ahead to the 
Kaufhof " )  
Expectat ions  of the pragmat ic  compo-  
nents :  
QUEST ION-ANSWER-  
INTERACTION-comp. :  answer  
T .ASK- INTERACTION~ 
comp.: an act of 
in fo rmat ion~giv ing  
TASKISPECIF ICAT ION ~ 
comp. : route - ,p lace  descr ip t ion ,  
par t ia l  goal  determinat ion ,  
goa l  dec la ra t ion  
SEMANTIC~comp.  : "zum Kaufhof "  is care ~ 
gor i zed  as a GOAL case slot.  
The categor ies  goal  dec la ra t ion  and 
p lace descr ip t ion  can be d i scarded ,  
because  the i r  requ i rements  are not 
matched.  S ince  an exp l i c i t  goa l  (bui l~ 
ding,  s t reet  connect ion  etc.)  is ut ter -  
ed the  requ i rements  of par t ia l  goal  
determinat ion  are fu l f i l l ed  f i rst .  This  
category  requ i res  a verb  of the f ie ld  
MOVE,  e.g.  "gehen"  ("to go").  The GOAL 
case slot matches  one of the requ i re -  
ments  of the verb,  but an AGENT is 
s t i l l  m iss ing .  S ince  the u t terance  is 
part  of a d ia logue  and it is d i rec ted  
f rom the person,  who is asked to g ive 
a d i rec t ion ,  to that person,  who had 
asked for the d i rec t ion ,  a re ference  to 
the last  person,  "s ie"  ("you") ,  is 
taken as AGENT.  
2. "gradaus  dutch  die F ressgass ' "  
( "s t ra ight  on through the F ressgass ' " )  
The expectat ions  on the pragmat ic  com- 
ponents  are the same as above.  "dutch  
die F ressgass ' "  is ca tegor i zed  as a 
PATH case slot.  In this case a route 
descr ip t ion  is p roved f i rst  and aga in  a 
MOVE-verb  is taken as a cand idate  for 
the verb.  The PATH case slot matches  
wi th  its requ i rements  and the adverb  
"gradaus"  is a poss ib le  descr ip t ion  of 
the way of MOVing .  The AGENT case slot 
is found as above.  
3. At last  a very  funny example .  One of 
our d ia logues  s tar ts  w i th  the fo l low ing  
sequence:  
X: to the old opera? 
Y: Yes? 
186 
Here Y must  have recogn ized ,  p resumably  
by eye contact ,  that X wants  to get 
into contact  wi th  him. X's answer,  
i tse l f  a quest ion ,  is qu i te  unpo l l te  
but unders tandab le .  Syntact i ca l l y  this 
u t te rance  is an e l l ip t i ca l  quest ion  
(vo ice r is ing,  when ut tered)  and on the 
semant ic  stage it can be categor i zed  as 
a GOAL case slot, depend ing  on "zur" 
and the fact that the NP refers to a 
bu i ld ing.  Since it is at the beg inn ing  
of a task -or iented  d ia logue  wi th  no 
task f ixed unt i l  now, it is ca tegor i zed  
as  a de~i .a f~o~i{ , ' c~ lo . .  A complete  ver- 
s ion of this u t te rance  may be 
"How can, I get to the old opera?"  
Another  poss ib le  in terpreta t ion  may be 
that X only  wants  to be conf i rmed in 
her /h l s  assumpt ion  that he/she is on 
the r ight way to his goal .  In this case 
a correct  answer  would  have been s imply  
"yes".  But a dec is ion  which in terpreta -  
t ion holds true can not be made wi th  
the ava i lab le  in fo rmat ion .  
V Conc lus ion  
It has been shown how some types of 
i l l 4 fo rmed input are handled,  espec ia l l y  
w i th  the help of semant ic  const ra in ts  and 
pragmat ic  cons iderat ions .  At present,  our 
work  in this f ie ld is laid on hand l ing  
se l focor rec t ions  above the word level ,  as 
you wi l l  f ind one in l lne 5 of the sample 
t rans la t ion .
