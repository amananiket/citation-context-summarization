1 Introduction 
We are concerned with grammar-based surface- 
syntactic analysis of running text. Morphological 
and syntactic analysis is here based on tags that ex- 
press surface-syntactic relations between functional 
categories such as Subject, Modifier, Main verb etc.; 
consider the following simple sentence: 
I PgOli @SUBJECT 
see  V PRES @MAINVERB 
a ART @>H 
bird li @OBJECT

2 Description of the parsing system 
The parsing system consists of the following modules: 
2.1 Preprocessor 
The preprocessor normalises the input text, detects 
sentence boundaries and punctuation marks, and 
identifies idioms and other fixed syntagms. 
2.2 Morphological analyser 
The ENGTWOL morphological nalyser is a 55,000 
entry Koskenniemi-style morphological description 
of English that assigns all recognised input word 
forms with all possible morphological readings as a 
disjunctive list. 
Those words not recognised by the ENGTWOL 
analyser are analysed by a heuristic module; part-of- 
speech readings are assigned on the basis of the form 
of the word (endings etc.). 
The morphologically analysed sentences are en- 
riched with syntactic and word boundary ambigui- 
ties and converted into regular expressions by simple 
awk programs. 
2.3 F in l te-State parser 
The Finite-State parser transforms entences and 
rules into finite-state automata. The parser com- 
putes the intersection ofthe sentence automaton and 
all rule automata; the intersection is the parse of the 
sentence. 
The grammar also contains aheuristic section that 
can be used to rank multiple analyses. 
3 Sample analysis 
The sentence Its leadership was insulted by editors 
gets two analyses, when no heuristics are applied:
