Abstract
Several algorithms are available for sen-
tence alignment, but there is a lack of
systematic evaluation and comparison of
these algorithms under different condi-
tions. In most cases, the factors which
can significantly affect the performance
of a sentence alignment algorithm have
not been considered while evaluating. We
have used a method for evaluation that
can give a better estimate about a sen-
tence alignment algorithm?s performance,
so that the best one can be selected. We
have compared four approaches using this
method. These have mostly been tried
on European language pairs. We have
evaluated manually-checked and validated
English-Hindi aligned parallel corpora un-
der different conditions. We also suggest
some guidelines on actual alignment.
1 Introduction
Aligned parallel corpora are collections of pairs of
sentences where one sentence is a translation of the
other. Sentence alignment means identifying which
sentence in the target language (TL) is a translation
of which one in the source language (SL). Such cor-
pora are useful for statistical NLP, algorithms based
on unsupervised learning, automatic creation of re-
sources, and many other applications.
Over the last fifteen years, several algorithms have
been proposed for sentence alignment. Their perfor-
mance as reported is excellent (in most cases not less
than 95%, and usually 98 to 99% and above). The
evaluation is performed in terms of precision, and
sometimes also recall. The figures are given for one
or (less frequently) more corpus sizes. While this
does give an indication of the performance of an al-
gorithm, the variation in performance under varying
conditions has not been considered in most cases.
Very little information is given about the conditions
under which evaluation was performed. This gives
the impression that the algorithm will perform with
the reported precision and recall under all condi-
tions.
We have tested several algorithms under differ-
ent conditions and our results show that the per-
formance of a sentence alignment algorithm varies
significantly, depending on the conditions of test-
ing. Based on these results, we propose a method
of evaluation that will give a better estimate of the
performance of a sentence alignment algorithm and
will allow a more meaningful comparison. Our view
is that unless this is done, it will not be possible to
pick up the best algorithm for certain set of con-
ditions. Those who want to align parallel corpora
may end up picking up a less suitable algorithm for
their purposes. We have used the proposed method
for comparing four algorithms under different con-
ditions. Finally, we also suggest some guidelines for
using these algorithms for actual alignment.
2 Sentence Alignment Methods
Sentence alignment approaches can be categorized
as based on sentence length, word correspondence,
and composite (where more than one approaches are
combined), though other techniques, such as cog-
99
nate matching (Simard et al, 1992) were also tried.
Word correspondence was used by Kay (Kay, 1991;
Kay and Roscheisen, 1993). It was based on the idea
that words which are translations of each other will
have similar distributions in the SL and TL texts.
Sentence length methods were based on the intuition
that the length of a translated sentence is likely to be
similar to that of the source sentence. Brown, Lai
and Mercer (Brown et al, 1991) used word count as
the sentence length, whereas Gale and Church (Gale
and Church, 1991) used character count. Brown, Lai
and Mercer assumed prior alignment of paragraphs.
Gale and Church relied on some previously aligned
sentences as ?anchors?. Wu (Wu, 1994) also used
lexical cues from corpus-specific bilingual lexicon
for better alignment.
Word correspondence was further developed in
IBM Model-1 (Brown et al, 1993) for statistical
machine translation. Melamed (Melamed, 1996)
also used word correspondence in a different (geo-
metric correspondence) way for sentence alignment.
Simard and Plamondon (Simard and Plamondon,
1998) used a composite method in which the first
pass does alignment at the level of characters as
in (Church, 1993) (itself based on cognate match-
ing) and the second pass uses IBM Model-1, fol-
lowing Chen (Chen, 1993). The method used by
Moore (Moore, 2002) also had two passes, the first
one being based on sentence length (word count) and
the second on IBM Model-1. Composite methods
are used so that different approaches can compli-
ment each other.
3 Factors in Performance
As stated above, the performance of a sentence
alignment algorithm depends on some identifiable
factors. We can even make predictions about
whether the performance will increase or decrease.
However, as the results given later show, the algo-
rithms don?t always behave in a predictable way. For
example, one of the algorithms did worse rather than
better on an ?easier? corpus. This variation in perfor-
mance is quite significant and it cannot be ignored
for actual alignment (table-1). Some of these factors
have been indicated in earlier papers, but these were
not taken into account while evaluating, nor were
their effects studied.
Translation of a text can be fairly literal or it can
be a recreation, with a whole range between these
two extremes. Paragraphs and/or sentences can be
dropped or added. In actual corpora, there can even
be noise (sentences which are not translations at all
and may not even be part of the actual text). This can
happen due to fact that the texts have been extracted
from some other format such as web pages. While
translating, sentences can also be merged or split.
Thus, the SL and TL corpora may differ in size.
All these factors affect the performance of an al-
gorithm in terms of, say, precision, recall and F-
measure. For example, we can expect the perfor-
mance to worsen if there is an increase in additions,
deletions, or noise. And if the texts were translated
fairly literally, statistical algorithms are likely to per-
form better. However, our results show that this does
not happen for all the algorithms.
The linguistic distance between SL and TL can
also play a role in performance. The simplest mea-
sure of this distance is in terms of the distance on
the family tree model. Other measures could be the
number of cognate words or some measure based
on syntactic features. For our purposes, it may not
be necessary to have a quantitative measure of lin-
guistic distance. The important point is that for lan-
guages that are distant, some algorithms may not
perform too well, if they rely on some closeness be-
tween languages. For example, an algorithm based
on cognates is likely to work better for English-
French or English-German than for English-Hindi,
because there are fewer cognates for English-Hindi.
It won?t be without a basis to say that Hindi is
more distant from English than is German. English
and German belong to the Indo-Germanic branch
whereas Hindi belongs to the Indo-Aryan branch.
There are many more cognates between English and
German than between English and Hindi. Similarly,
as compared to French, Hindi is also distant from
English in terms of morphology. The vibhaktis of
Hindi can adversely affect the performance of sen-
tence length (especially word count) as well as word
correspondence based algorithms. From the syntac-
tic point of view, Hindi is a comparatively free word
order language, but with a preference for the SOV
(subject-object-verb) order, whereas English is more
of a fixed word order and SVO type language. For
sentence length and IBM model-1 based sentence
100
alignment, this doesn?t matter since they don?t take
the word order into account. However, Melamed?s
algorithm (Melamed, 1996), though it allows ?non-
monotonic chains? (thus taking care of some differ-
ence in word order), is somewhat sensitive to the
word order. As Melamed states, how it will fare
with languages with more word variation than En-
glish and French is an open question.
Another aspect of the performance which may not
seem important from NLP-research point of view, is
its speed. Someone who has to use these algorithms
for actual alignment of large corpora (say, more than
1000 sentences) will have to realize the importance
of speed. Any algorithm which does worse than
O(n) is bound to create problems for large sizes. Ob-
viously, an algorithm that can align 5000 sentences
in 1 hour is preferable to the one which takes three
days, even if the latter is marginally more accurate.
Similarly, the one which takes 2 minutes for 100 sen-
tences, but 16 minutes for 200 sentences will be dif-
ficult to use for practical purposes. Actual corpora
may be as large as a million sentences. As an esti-
mate of the speed, we also give the runtimes for the
various runs of all the four algorithms tested.
Some algorithms, like those based on cognate
matching, may even be sensitive to the encoding or
notation used for the text. One of the algorithms
tested (Melamed, 1996) gave worse performance
when we used a notation called ITRANS for the
Hindi text, instead of the WX-notation.1
4 Evaluation in Previous Work
There have been attempts to systematically evaluate
and compare word alignment algorithms (Och and
Ney, 2003) but, surprisingly, there has been a lack of
such evaluation for sentence alignment algorithms.
One obvious problem is the lack of manually aligned
and checked parallel corpora.
Two cases where a systematic evaluation was per-
formed are the ARCADE project (Langlais et al,
1996) and Simard et al (Simard et al, 1992). In the
ARCADE project, six alignment systems were eval-
uated on several different text types. Simard et al
performed an evaluation on several corpus types and

consonants and longer length for vowels. In addition, ?w? rep-
resents ?t? as in French entre and ?x? means something similar
to ?d? in French de, hence the name of the notation.
corpus sizes. They, also compared the performance
of several (till then known) algorithms.
In most of the other cases, evaluation was per-
formed on only one corpus type and one corpus size.
In some cases, certain other factors were considered,
but not very systematically. In other words, there
wasn?t an attempt to study the effect of various fac-
tors described earlier on the performance. In some
cases, the size used for testing was too small. One
other detail is that size was sometimes mentioned in
terms of number of words, not number of sentences.
5 Evaluation Measures
We have used local (for each run) as well as global
(over all the runs) measures of performance of an
algorithm. These measures are:
? Precision (local and global)
? Recall (local and global)
? F-measure (local and global)
? 95% Confidence interval of F-measure (global)
? Runtime (local)
6 An Evaluation Scheme
Unless sentence alignment is correct, everything
else that uses aligned parallel corpora, such as word
alignment (for automatically creating bilingual dic-
tionaries) or statistical machine translation will be
less reliable. Therefore, it is important that the best
algorithm is selected for sentence alignment. This
requires that there should be a way to systemati-
cally evaluate and compare sentence alignment al-
gorithms.
To take into account the above mentioned factors,
we used an evaluation scheme which can give an
estimate of the performance under different condi-
tions. Under this scheme, we calculate the measures
given in the previous section along the following di-
mensions:
? Corpus type
? Corpus size
? Difference in sizes of SL and TL corpora
? Noise
101
We are also considering the corpus size as a factor
in performance because the second pass in Moore?s
algorithm is based on IBM Model-1, which needs
training. This training is provided at runtime by us-
ing the tentative alignments obtained from the first
pass (a kind of unsupervised learning). This means
that larger corpus sizes (enough training data) are
likely to make word correspondence more effective.
Even for sentence length methods, corpus size may
play a role because they are based on the distribution
of the length variable. The distribution assumption
(whether Gaussian or Poisson) is likely to be more
valid for larger corpus sizes.
The following algorithms/approaches were evalu-
ated:
? Brn: Brown?s sentence length (word count)
based method, but with Poisson distribution
? GC: Church and Gale?s sentence length (char-
acter count) based method, but with Poisson
distribution
? Mmd: Melamed?s geometric correspondence
based method
? Mre: Moore?s two-pass method (word count
plus word correspondence)
For Brn and GC we used our own implemen-
tations. For Mmd we used the GMA alignment
tool and for Mre we used Moore?s implementation.
Only 1-to-1 mappings were extracted from the out-
put for calculating precision, recall and F-measure,
since the test sets had only 1-to-1 alignments. En-
glish and Hindi stop lists and a bilingual lexicon
were also supplied to the GMA tool. The parame-
ter settings for this tool were kept the same as for
English-Malay. For Brn and GC, the search method
was based on the one used by Moore, i.e., searching
within a growing diagonal band. Using this search
method meant that no prior segmentation of the cor-
pora was needed (Moore, 2002), either in terms
of aligned paragraphs (Gale and Church, 1991), or
some aligned sentences as anchors (Brown et al,
1991).
We would have liked to study the effect of linguis-
tic distance more systematically, but we couldn?t get
equivalent manually-checked aligned parallel cor-
pora for other pairs of languages. We have to rely
on the reported results for other language pairs, but
those results, as mentioned before, do not mention
the conditions of testing which we are considering
for our evaluation and, therefore, cannot be directly
compared to our results for English-Hindi. Still, we
did an experiment on the English-French test data
(447 sentences) for the shared task in NAACL 2003
workshop on parallel texts (see table-1).
For all our experiments, the text in Hindi was in
WX-notation.
In the following sub-sections we describe the de-
tails of the data sets that were prepared to study the
variation in performance due to various factors.
6.1 Corpus Type
Three different types of corpora were used for the
same language pair (English-Hindi) and size. These
were EMILLE, ERDC and India Today. We took
2500 sentences from each of these, as this was the
size of the smallest corpus.
6.1.1 EMILLE
EMILLE corpus was constructed by the EMILLE
project (Enabling Minority Language Engineering),
Lancaster University, UK, and the Central Institute
of Indian Languages (CIIL), Mysore, India. It con-
sists of monolingual, parallel and annotated corpora
for fourteen South Asian languages. The parallel
corpus part has a text (200000 words) in English and
its translations in Hindi, Bengali, Punjabi, Gujarati
and Urdu. The text is from many different domains
like education, legal, health, social, and consumer
markets. The documents are mostly in simple, for-
mal language. The translations are quite literal and,
therefore, we expected this corpus to be the ?easiest?.
6.1.2 ERDC
The ERDC corpus was prepared by Electronic
Research and Development Centre, NOIDA, India.
It also has text in different domains but it is an un-
aligned parallel corpus. A project is going on to pre-
pare an aligned and manually checked version of this
corpus. We have used a part of it that has already
been aligned and manually checked. It was our opin-
ion that the translations in this corpus are less literal
and should be more difficult for sentence alignment
than EMILLE. We used this corpus for studying the
effect of corpus size, in addition to corpus type.

6.1.3 India Today
India Today is a magazine published in both En-
glish and Hindi. We used some parallel text col-
lected from the Internet versions of this magazine. It
consists of news reports or articles which appeared
in both languages. We expected this corpus to be the
most difficult because the translations are often more
like adaptations. They may even be rewritings of the
English reports or articles in Hindi. This corpus had
2500 sentences.
6.2 Corpus Size
To study the effect of corpus size, the sizes used
were 500, 1000, 5000 and 10000. All these data sets
were from ERDC corpus (which was expected to be
neither very easy nor very difficult).
6.3 Noise and Difference in Sizes of SL and TL
Corpora
To see the effect of noise and the difference in sizes
of SL and TL corpora, we took three cases for each
of the corpus types and sizes:
? Same size without noise
? Same size with noise
? Different size with noise
Three different data sets were prepared for each
corpus type and for each corpus size. To obtain
such data sets from the aligned, manually checked
and validated corpora, we added noise to the cor-
pora. The noise was in the form of sentences from
some other unrelated corpus. The number of such
sentences was 10% each of the corpus size in the
second case and 5% to SL and 15% to the TL in the
third case. The sentences were added at random po-
sitions in the SL and TL corpora and these positions
were recorded so that we could automatically cal-
culate precision, recall and F-measure even for data
sets with noise, as we did for other data sets. Thus,
each algorithm was tested on (3+4)(3) = 21 data sets.
7 A Limitation
One limitation of our work is that we are considering
only 1-to-1 alignments. This is partly due to prac-
tical constraints, but also because 1-to-1 alignments
are the ones that can be most easily and directly used
for linguistic analysis as well as machine learning.
Since we had to prepare a large number of data
sets of sizes up to 10000 sentences, manual check-
ing was a major constraint. We had four options.
The first was to take a raw unaligned corpus and
manually align it. This option would have allowed
consideration of 1-to-many, many-to-1, or partial

alignments. The second option was to pass the text
through an alignment tool and then manually check
the output for all kinds of alignment. The third op-
tion was to check only for 1-to-1 alignments from
this output. The fourth option was to evaluate on
much smaller sizes.
In terms of time and effort required, there is an
order of difference between the first and the second
and also between the second and the third option. It
is much easier to manually check the output of an
aligner for 1-to-1 alignments than to align a corpus
from the scratch. We couldn?t afford to use the first
two options. The fourth option was affordable, but
we decided to opt for a more thorough evaluation of
1-to-1 alignments, than for evaluation of all kinds of
alignments for smaller sizes. Thus, our starting data
sets had only 1-to-1 alignments.
In future, we might extend the evaluation to all
kinds of alignments, since the manual alignment
currently being done on ERDC corpus includes par-
tial and 1-to-2 or 2-to-1 alignments. Incidentally,
there are rarely any 2-to-1 alignments in English-
Hindi corpus since two English sentences are rarely
combined into one Hindi sentence (when translating
from English to Hindi), whereas the reverse is quite
possible.
8 Evaluation Results
The results for various corpus types are given in
table-1, for corpus sizes in table-2, and the global
measures in table-3. Among the four algorithms
tested, Moore?s (Mre) gives the best results (ex-
cept for the EMILLE corpus). This is as expected,
since Mre combines sentence length based method
with word correspondence. The results for Mmd are
the worst, but it should be noted that the results for
Mmd reported in this paper may not be the best that
can be obtained with it, because its performance de-
pends on some parameters. Perhaps with better tun-
ing for English-Hindi, it might perform better. An-
other expected outcome is that the results for GC
(character count) are better than Brn (word count).
One reason for this is that there are more of charac-
ters than words (Gale and Church, 1991).
Leaving aside the tuning aspect, the low perfor-
mance of Mmd may be due to the fact that it relies
on cognate matching, and there are fewer cognates
between Hindi and English. It might also be due to
the syntactic differences (word order) between Hindi
and English. This could, perhaps be taken care of
by increasing the maximum point dispersal thresh-
old (relaxing the linearity constraint), as suggested
by Melamed (Melamed, 1996).
104
The results of experiment on English-French
(table-1) show that Mmd performs better for this
language pair than for English-Hindi, but it still
seems to be more sensitive to noise than the other
three algorithms. Mre performed the best for
English-French too.
With respect to speed, Brn and GC are the fastest,
Mre is marginally slower, and Mmd is much slower.
The effects of the previously mentioned factors on
performance have been summarized below.
8.1 Corpus Type
Brn, GC, and Mmd performed almost equally well
for EMILLE and ERDC corpora, but not that well
for India Today. However, surprisingly, Mre per-
formed much worse for EMILLE than it did for
the other two corpora. It could be because of the
fact that the EMILLE has a lot of very short (1-3
words) sentences, and word correspondence (in the
second pass) may not be that effective for such sen-
tences. The results don?t support our assumption
that EMILLE is easier than ERDC, but India Today
does turn out to be more difficult than the other two
for all the test cases. This is understandable since
the translations in this corpus are much less literal.
8.2 Corpus Size
Only in the case of Mre, the performance almost
consistently increased with size. This is as expected
since the second pass in Mre needs training from
the results of the first pass. The corpus size has to be
large for this training to be effective. There doesn?t
seem to be a clear relationship between size and per-
formance for the other three algorithms.
8.3 Noise and Difference in Sizes of SL and TL
Corpora
As expected, introducing noise led to a decrease
in performance for all the algorithms (table-1 and
table-2). However (barring EMILLE) Mre seems to
become less sensitive to noise as the corpus size in-
creases. This again could be due to the unsupervised
learning aspect of Mre.
Making the SL and TL corpora differ in size
tended to reduce the performance in most cases, but
sometimes the performance marginally improved.

9 Some Notes on Actual Corpus Alignment
Based on the evaluation results and our experience
while manually checking alignments, we make some
observations below which could be useful to those
who are planning to create aligned parallel corpora.
Contrary to what we believed, sentence length
based algorithms turn out to be quite robust, but also
contrary to the commonly held view, there is scope
for improvement in the performance of these algo-
rithms by combining them with other techniques as
Moore has done. However, as the performance of
Mre on EMILLE shows, these additional techniques
might sometimes decrease the performance.
There is a tradeoff between precision and recall,
just as between robustness and accuracy (Simard and
Plamondon, 1998). If the corpus aligned automati-
cally is to be used without manual checking, then we
should opt for maximum precision. But if it?s going
to be manually checked before being used, then we
105
should opt for maximum recall. It depends on the
application too (Langlais et al, 1996), but if man-
ual checking is to be done, we can as well try to
get the maximum number of alignments, since some
decrease in precision is not going to make manual
checking much more difficult.
If the automatically aligned corpus is not to be
checked manually, it becomes even more important
to perform a systematic evaluation before aligning
a corpus, otherwise the parallel corpus will not be
reliable either for machine learning or for linguistic
analysis.
10 Conclusion
We used a systematic evaluation method for select-
ing a sentence alignment algorithm with English and
Hindi as the language pair. We tested four algo-
rithms for different corpus types and sizes, for the
same and different sizes of SL and TL corpora, as
well as presence and absence of noise. The evalu-
ation scheme we have described can be used for a
more meaningful comparison of sentence alignment
algorithms. The results of the evaluation show that
the performance depends on various factors. The di-
rection of this variation (increase or decrease) was as
predicted in most of the cases, but some results were
unexpected. We also presented some suggestions on
using an algorithm for actual alignment.
