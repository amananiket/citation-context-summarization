I shall xeturn later t o  this metaphor of generations, bu t  what is cne 
to say in general terns of a field where yesterday's br ightes t  spots are 
today's f i r s t  generation systems, even though they have not been criticised 
i n  p r in t ,  nor shown i n  any generally acceptable yay to be fundamentally 
wrong? Part  of the answer lies i n  the profound role of fashion in Artificial 
Intel l igence i n  its present pre-scientific phase. A cyni ta l  American pro- 
fessor remarked recently that Artificial ~ntelligencd (AX) had an affair w i t h  
someonels work every year or two, and that,  just as there were no reasons for 
galling i n  love, so ,  l a t e r ,  there were no reasons for f a l l i n g  out  again.  In 
tho csse of Winograd's work it is imprtant  now t o  resist this fashiony and 
re-emphasize what a good piece of research it was, as 3 shall inl  a m~ment.

flavour . 
In this paper I w a n t  to sort out a little what is agreed and what is 
noti what are swre of the outstanding disputes and how testable are the 
claims being made. If what follows seems unduly philosophical, it should 
be remetsabered that  Uttle - is agreed, and almost no achievements are beyond 
question. To pretend otherwise, by concentrating only tm the d e t a i b o f  
established programs, ~ u l d  be meretricious and misleading. 
To euntey an enewetic field like thie one is inevitably to laavo a 
great deal of excel lent  work unextiminad, a t  least if one i a  going to do 
more than give a paragraph to each research project. I have left out of 
cotasideration at least seven groups of projects: 
(1) Early work in Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language 
that has been sumeyed by Wfnograd (1973) and Simmons (1970a) 
among others. 
(2) Work by graduate students of, or intellectually dependent upsn 
that of,  people discussed in same detail  here. 
( 3 )  Wxk that derives essentially from projects described i n  detail 
here. This embraces several groups interested i n  testing 
psychological hypotheses, as re11  as others constructing large- 
scale systems for speech recognition. I have devoted no space 
to speech recognition as such here, for it seems to me to depend 
upon the quality of semantic and inferential understanding as 
much as anything, and so I have concentrated upon this more 
fundamental task.  
(4) Work on language generators, as opposed to analysers and under- 
standers. They are essential for obtaining any testable output, 
but are thearetically secondary.

done a t  the moment, and many of the pr incipal  researchers change the i r  views 
on very fundamental questions between one paper and the next without drawiw 
any a t tent ion  t o  the f ac t .  Cheap self-contradictions and changes of mind 
are a l l  too easy t o  f i n d ,  so cr i t ic ism and smparisons are best drawn w i t h  a 
very broad brush and a l i g h t  stroke. 
2. Winograd's Understanding System 
Winograd's systea runs as  a dialogue, i n  r e a l  time, between a human 
operator who types i n  m e S q e s ,  and t h e  system proper, called SHRDLU, which 
displays on a screen pictures of a closed world of coloured blocks and 
p y r a i d a ,  a b o x  in- which they can be put, and an arm or crane khat can 
move che objects about. SHRDLU displays its replies to the operator by 
writing on the samq screen. The fo l lowing  is a discontinuous sample of 
the dialogue Winograd giws in his book. SHIIDLU1s replies are in the 
upper case r

Thia, ingenious program was also ahle to accept new definitions.& words, 
such as steeple'; to make use of what it knew about the p~operties o f  t h e  
objects described, such as that a block could have i ts  top cleared off, but 
a pyramid could not;  and also ta remember what it had done before, as in t h e  
sample above. 
The syn-tactic analySis program was written in PR%RAMMAR, a procedural 
language related to PLANNER (see Hewitt ' 6 9 ) .  T h i s  means that  a familia 
phase  structure rule such as 
s + N P + w  
(to be interpreted: a sentence consists of a noun phrase followed by a verb 
phrase) would be expressed as: 
(PDEFIME SENTENCE 
( ( (  PARSE NP) NIL FAIL) 
( (  PAFSE VP) FAIL FAIL RETURN)) )  
The de ta i l s  of the nota t ion  need not detairius  at this po in t ;  what 
Ls important is that Winograd's gramuax 4s not  tile cmnventirrnaL list of  
culas, but small sub-programs Like tha lines above, that  actually xaysooant 
x-o~iiures for iulposing the  desirad grstmalieA1 structure, 
The f i r s t  leva1 of linguistic p m & u r ~ s  in the system applies a 
systemic grammar' , dur to M.A. K. Mallidal* (1970) , which inapses a hierarch- 
ical structure of clauses on tihe input senterac&s\, which secb tc' b~ dram 
from a vocabulary of about 175 ims\ls. 
Winogradas parsing is top down, and depth f i r s t ,  with na automatic 
back up. The parsing progrim fur each griuxnatical c a t c q ~ r ~ ~  is n functional 
definition in PRfXZWWR, which can be stated either as &VP, fcr SEWPEHCE, 
or as a f low-char t  as below for VP:

Here is Winograd's own account of the start of this top-down parsing 
procedure for the sentence "Pick up a red block" (where t h e  material i n  
C 1 is added explanation and not Winogradas om)  : 
"The CLRUSE program looks at the first wrd, to decide what w r i t  the 
CLRUSE begins w i t h .  If it sees an adverb, it assumes the sentence begins 
w i t h  a single-word modifier tslowly, Jack l i f t e d  the book] ; iP it sres a 
preposit ion,  it looks .for an i n i t i a l  PREP6 Con top of the h i l l  stood a tree] 
If it sees a BINOBR, it calls the CLAUSE program to look for a BOUND CLAUSE 
C~efore you get there, w e  l e f t ] .  In English (and possibly a l l  languages) 
the firsb word of a construction often gives a very goad clue as to what that  
construction will be. fn this case, "pick" is a verb, and indicates  that we 
may have an IHPERATIW CLAUSE. The program. s t a r t s  the VO program w i t l a  the 
i n i t i a l  VG feature. l i s t  (VG IWER), looking for a VG of this type.  This 
must either begin w i t h  some form of the verb "do" [Do not call me!] or w i t h  
the main verb itself [Call me!]. Since the next word is not: "do" it checks 
the n e x t  word i n  the input ( i n  U~is case still the first word) :o see whether 
it is the in f in i t ive  form of a verb. If SO, it is to be attached to the 
parsing tree, and given the additionql feature MVB (main verb). The current 
structure can be diagramad as: 
(CLAUSE MAJOR) 
(VG IWER) 
(VB MVB INF TRANS ,WRT -------------- pick 
T W S  AND VPRT cmfw fran the definition of the word "pick" when we zalled 
the function P M S q  for a word.4' 
Mter this syntactic parsing, a number of "semantic specidlists'' attach 
cwbantic structures to specific syntactic  dnes. A semantic d e f i n i t i o n  of an

The meaning of verbs i n  SHRDLU is mre mmplex. The seaantic c ~ w p n e n t  
has access to n definition fer "pick-up" just as it d ~ e s  for "tt5d1' a:~d "klcck" 
and this definition will enable SHRDLU to translate "pick-up tateaents" into 
Micro-planner in a mdnner analogous to that for noun phrases. 
These are two complications here. Firstly "pick-up", u n l i k e  "red", is

defined in terms of other concepts i n  the system: i n  particular, i n  terms of 
GR?SP and RAISEHAND, which axe two of the three basic actiQns in the system. 
Secondly, there are two r r p e s  of verb definition, semant ic  and inferential 
Winograd does not give the semantic definition for "pick-up", but here is 
the  one for  "grasp" which is a closelb- related verb.

which says e~sentiallp that grasping is scmathinq dorle by an animate entity 
to a oanlpulabla one (flret line). More of the real content of such actions 
is found in their inferential definition. Here is the one fox '"pick-up":

TSlis definition allows the program to actually carry out the "pick-up" 
caamand if it is possible to do so in the simulated world, as it would not 
be, for example, if -re were already a block dn top of the red one.. 
PICKUP is being def i led in edzrms of a number of more p r i m i t i v e  s&-actions, 
such as GRASP and RAISEHAND each of which must be carried out in order that 
sameming may indeed be p i c k e d  up. There s u b - a c t i o ~  themselves have in- 
fesential  definitions: the one given for GRASP, for example, i s  somewhat 
differant from i t s  "C1(&EANS1' definition g i v e n  above, although the inferential 
iPefini,tiona are aim, i n  sane se-e, definitions of meaning as wall as pro- 
gra~as  for actually carrying out the associated conmands. 
One reason for the enormous impdct of this work was that, prior to its 
appearance, A1 work was not very l i n g u i s t i c a l l y  interesting, while the 
eystems of tho linguists had no place far the use of inference and real 
world knowledge. Thus a very limited union between the two  techniques 
was able to breed considerable results. Before Winograd &ere were few 
pmgrams i n  A 1  that could take a reasonable complex English s e n t a c e  and 
ascribe any structure whatever to it. In early classics of 'ngtura l  
language understanding' in AX, such as Bobrow's STUDENT (1968) problem 
solver for simple algebra,  input sentences had to be short and of stereo- 
typed form, such as "what is the sum of .... ?"  
Conversely, in linguistics, there was, unti l  very recently, l i t t l e  
speculation on how we understand the reference of. pronouns in such eleqent-  
ary sentences as "The s o l d i e r s  fired at the woslen.and I saw several f a l l " ,  
where it is c l e a r  that the answer is both definite, and that fhding i t  
requires some inferential manipulation of genaralirrtiens dwut  the world.

3. $ m e  Discussion of S W L U  
S ~ J  -fax, the reaction ts Winugqad \s work has L m t k  wbSrSrla ~ineri t heal. 
What would crAitics find to attack i f  tthtzp M ~ S F  90 a9nde.I: F i r s t l y ,  that 
~~ inegrad ' s  linguistic system is highly w n s r ~ ~ ? a t i w ,  and that UIQ distinct- 
ion between 'syntax' and 'semantics' m y  not Lw necessary at all. S e w n i i l y  
#at h i s  semantics is tied tu the s h p l e  referential w r l d  cf the  blccks  i t ?  
a way *.at m u l d  make it fnextensihle, to any genexal, real tmrld, situatioh. 
Suppose 'block' were allowed mean 'an obstrxxctidnl and ' a  nental ir,k,i*- 
i t i o n ' ,  as well as ' a  cubic object'. It is dauktful whether Winograd's 
features and rules could express the  ambiguity, and, nore i m ~ r t a n t l y ,  
whether the simple s t r u c t u e s  he manipulated cou ld  decide correctly between 
t he  a l t e r n a t i v e  meanings i n  any given c ~ n t e x t  of user Again, far  more 
sophisticated and systematic case structures than those hg used might be 
needed to resolve the ambiguity of 'in1 in "He ran the mile i n  five minutes 
and Ire ran the m i l t .  in a pawr kwg , as we11 as 'tllu ccmbination ~ , l f  case 
w i t h  wrd sense a m h i p i t y  i n  'Ho p u t  t h o  key in t h e  l ~ r k '  (door lock1 and 
'Be threw the key in the luck1 (river leek). 
The b l o c k s  mrld is also strongly deduct-ive and l w i c a l 1 y  closed, S f  
g r a v i t y  were introduced into i t ,  then anything supkwrted t h a t  war pushed i n  
a c e r t a i n  way would have, logically have, to  f a l l .  B u t  the  cazmon sense 
-
wlorld, of ordinary language, is not  like that: in t h ~  'waaen and soldiers' 
example given e a r l i e r ,  .the pronoun ' s evera l1  can be said to be resolved 
u s i n g  same generalisation such as ' t h ings  shot a t  and hurt tend t o  fall' 
There are no logical 'have to's1 there ,  even though the meaning of the ~ r o -  
noun i s  perfectly d e f i n i t e .  
Indeed, it might be argued that,  in a sense, and as r ~ a f i s  its seman- 
tics, Winograd's system is not  about na tu ra l  language a t  a l l ,  but a b u t  the 
- -
technical question of how goals and sub-goals are to be crganised in a 
problem-solving system capable of mani~ulating simple physical ehjects. 
If n reeqber, for example, that tfre key problem that brought b w n  the 
emrr#rur work on mchiae translation i n  the Fiftiea and Sixties, was that 
of the eensa d i g u i t y  of nattWi.l. language wprds, then we will look in 
vain to SHRDLU Lor any help w i t h  that problem. There seem? to be only 
one dear exmaple of aur aLnbiguous mrd in the whole system, namely that of 
'curitairat as it appears in 'The b o x  contains a red block'  and rhe stack 
Again, i f  on@ glahces back a t  the definit ion of 'pick-up' quoted &ve, 
ana can see t)cdt it. i e  in fact an e%pression rrE a prcrcedure f ~ r  picking up 
an ob5ect i n  the SHR~LU .yet=. Nothing about it, for ekample, would help 
one, understand thep~rfe~t lv  ordinary sant;ence 'I picked up my bags ?tom the 
plstforn, and ran for the train' ,  let alne any sentenco no t  &out  a physical 
action performable by the hearer. One could put the point so: what wa are 
gFveR i n  the PLRNFtE3I code i s .no t  a sense of 'pick up1 but an exardple of.its 
-
use, just as 'John picked up the volunteer from the aueience by leaning over 
the edpeeog the stage and W W W  her up by means of a rope clenched in his 
teeth1 is not so much a sense of ,the verb as a use of it. 
n o s e  who like very general analogies may have.noticgd that Wittgen- 
stain (1953 para. 2ff) devated considerable space to the construction of an 
e1sentaz-y language of blocks, heaxus and slabs; one postulated on the 
as tipn that the words of language were basically, as is supposed in 
modal theory, the names of i tems. But, as he showed of the enterprise, 
.nd to the eatisfaction of aav readers, "That philosaphicat concer~t cf, 
meaning ( i .e .  af words as the unernbiyuous names uf physical ~bjects- - -W) 
has i t s  place in a primitive idea of the way language funotions. But one 
c a ~  aleo say that it is the idea of a lanyuaye more primitive than ougs". 
(my italics). 
To all this, it might be countered that -it has not been shown that 
the language fac i l i t ies  I have descrlb&d c m t  be incorporated in the 
structures that SHRDLU manipulates. and-th%tt, even if they c w l d  not, the 
work muld still be significant in virtue of its orisinal control stzuctura 
and its demonstration that rpal world knovledge am bv uerged-with ling-

It i s  interesting 'to notice that Woods' is ,  i n  virtue of his strong 
position an truth conditions, probably the only piece of work in the o f i ~ l d  
of A 1  and natural language to satiefy Hayes' (1974) recent demand* that  t o  
be 'Lntellectually respectable' a knowledge syptem must have na tu ra l  model 
thwretic semantics, i n  Tarski's senso. Since no-one has over given prec3se 
tzuth conditions for any interesting piece of discourse, such as, say, Woods1 
arm papers, one might claim that h i s  theoretical presupposittons necessarily 
limit his work to the analysis of micro-worlds (as dis t inct  from everyday 
language) . However, i f  Woods ' ' internal ' interpretation of tho 'meanings 
are procedurest slogah has certain drawbacks, so too does Winograd's, or 
what one might call  the 'external' i n t e rp re t a t i on .  By Ghat I mean Winograd'g

cedures, and ir) acway that t l ~ e  meanings of 'concentrate', ' c a l l ' ,  'have', 
' in twpret1 ,  e tc ,  are - not self-evidently rep1 world procedures that we could 
Set out in PLANNER for  a r o b t .  Of course, Ninograd 4s free to  concentrate 
on any micro-world he wishes, and all I am drawing attention to  here is thd 
danger of assuming that natural language is nomaiky about real world pro- 
cedures and, worse st i l l ,  the implicit making bf the assumption that we can- 
not understand discourse about a procedure unless we can do it ourselves. I 
aa not saying that Winograd i s  making this evidently false assumption, only 
that the rhetoric surrounding the application 05  the !meanings are procedures1 
sloglsln tx~ h i s  system m y  cause the  unwary t o  do so. 
There is quite a different and low-level problem about the equivalence 
of Woods' and Winograd's systems, i f  w e  consider what we might call the 
received co-n-sense view of their  work, Consider the following three 
assertions: 
(1) s system is an implementation of a transformational grammar 
(2) Winograd's work has shown the irrelevance of transformational 
grammar for language analysis - a'view widely held by reviewers 
of his work. 
* a view modified in Hayes (1975) where it now seems that programs/pro- 
cdures  would serve as a 'semantics' instead (a quite different, and 
more reasonable, position, of course). 
(3) Woods' and Winograd's systems are formally equivalent - a view 
held by both of them. 
There is clearly swathing of an inconsistent triad anronyst thosr 
three widely held breliaFs. T31a txouble probably centxus Gn the r~xact 
sense which Woods1 nark is formally equivalent to a t rans f~mat iona l~  
graaraslar - not a question that n e d  detain us here, but one worth p l n t f n g  
out in passing 
4. Scwe More General Uckgraund IasurfL 
Winograd's hvrk is a central rrxcmplr? of the 'Artificial fn l~ l l i gr?nc*c  
paradigm of h.ngu&ge', using '~aradicp'  in Kuhn's (10701 sense of a 1arqe 
scale revision in systematic thinking, where the,pa.radigru r e v i s e  is ,the 
'generati- paradigm1 of the  Chmskyan linguists fChomsky 1 9 5 7 ) .  F r a  
the A 1  pintof view, the generative linguistic tmrk of the last fifteen 
years has three principal defects. Firstly, the generation of sentences, 
with whatever attached structures, is not in anv interesting sense a dem- 
onstration of human understanding, nor is the separation of khe well-formed 
from the ill-fomed, by such methods- for understanding requires, at the 
very least, b t h  the generation & sentences as parts of coherent discourse 
and some attampt to interpret, rather than qer5ly zeject, what seen to be 
ill-farmed utterances. Neither the transformational grammarians following 
Chomsky, nor their successors the generative semanticists (Lak-off  1971), 
have ever-eSplicitAy rknounced thd generative paradigm. 
Secondly, Chmsky's  distinction between pexfomance and competence 
models, and his advocacy of the latter, have isolated modern generative 
linguistics from any effecti- - test of the systems of ruhes it proposes. 
Whether or not me distinction was intended to hdve this  effect, it has 
meant that a y  test sxtuation necessarily involves performance, which is 
wnaLdered vutsfde the province of serious linguistic stugy. And any 
embdiment of a svstein of rules in a computer, and assessment of its out 
put, would be perf~rmance. AI, too, is much concerned with the structure 
of linguistic processes, independent of any particular implementation,** 
** Vide: "Artificial Intellige~ce is the s.tudy of intellectual mechanisms 
apart from applications and apart f r a  how such mechanisms are realised 
in the human or in animals. '' (McCarthy 1974) 
but implementation i s  never excluded, as it is from competence models, but 
rather encouraged. 
Thirdly, as f mentioned before, there was 'mtil recently rio place in 
the generative paradigm for inferences from fac ts  and inductive generalis- 
atlona, even though vex;y simple examples demonstrate the need for it. 
This l a s t  point, a b ~ u t  the shortcomings of conventional linguistics 
is not  at all new, and i n  A 1  is at least  as old as Minsky's (1968,p.22) 
obawvat ion that in 'He put the box on the table. Because it wasn' t  level,  
it s l i d  o f f ' ,  the l a s t  ' itt can only be referred correctly to the box, 
rqther than the t&le, on the basis of some knowledge quite oth#r than 
that i n  a conventional, and implausible, linguistic so lut ion  s m h  as the 
creation of a class of 'level nouns' sb that a box would not be considered 
as being or n o t  being level. 
These points would be generally conceded by those who believe there 
isam AX paradigm of language understanding, but there wdlrld be Ear less 
agreement over the p s f k i v e  content of the paradigm, The txouble begins 
with the def in i t ion  of 'understanding' as applied t o  a computer. A t  one 
extreme are those who say the word can o n l y  rqfer t o  the performance of a 
machine: to its ability to, say, sustaih dome farm of dialogue long enough 
arad s e n s b l y  enough for a h w n  interrogator to be unsure whether what he 
is conversing w i t h  i s  a machine or not. On the other hand, there are 
=my, a h s t  certainly  a majority, who argue that more is required, in that 
the msthde and representations of knowledge by which the pexformance i s  
achieved must be of the r ight  formal sort, and that mere performance based 
-
on ad hoc methods does no t  demonstrate understanding. 
This issue is closely related to that of  the role  of dqduction i n  
natural language understanding, simply because deduction is often the 
structure mant when 'right methods' are mentioned. The dispute between 
those who argue for, or, like Winograd, use deductive methods, and those 
who dvocate othex inferential systms closer to cammon sense reasoning, 
is i n  m y  ways a pseudo-issue because it is so d i f f i c u l t  t~ define cltarly 
w h a t  a mn-deductive system is, (if by that is  meant a system that cannot 
i n  principle be lnodellea oy a deductive system) since almost any set of 
forrpal'procedures, including 'invalid inferences1, can be s o  displayed. 
The heart of the matter concdrns the  most appropriate kom on an infsrsnce 
system, rather #an how t h s s ~  infercncas may be &xim~tisFd, and i t  may 
well t u r n  out that the most appmpriatc fom for plausLbla r r a o ~ n i n g  in 
order to understand is indocd non-deductive. Tl~is s u m  insight has 
largely defused anot2at.r tlu&med issue: wha ther t l ~ n  a p p ~ v ~ r l a t e  r &xressnt- 
stions sl~ould be proer;.dwes or d@claxntions. Winoymdts w ~ r k  was wE the 
former type, as was shown by h i s  definitions of *urJs like 'pickup' as 
procedures f u r  actually pickirry t h inys  up i n  U\F Blecks ~ ~ s l d .  H Q W Q V ~ ? ~ ,  
simple pr~xcddral rcprcmntati~nu usually hnvo the disadvantage that, if 
YOU are QO~IKJ to indicate, Ess every ' it=' of k n s w l d g e ,  how it is tc k5;?.c 
-
used, then, if you may use it on a number of kinds uE ocsssi&n, ' y ~ u  will 
have to store it that numb.es of times. So, i f  y ~ u  want ta change it 
later, you will also have to remeinher to ohange it in all t h e  different  
places you have put  it. There is the additional disadvantage of lack of 
perspicuity: anyone reading the pr~cedural version of (he Winograd grammar 
r u l e  I gave earlier, will almost certainly find the c.onventilc?nal9, declar- 
ative, version easier to understand, 
So then, t h e  fa&hion far a l l  things procedural has to some extent 
abated (see Winograd 1974). There is general agreement that any system 
should show, as it were how i t  is actual ly  to  be applied to l a n g u a ~ e ,  b u t  
that is n o t  the s-e as demanding that it should be w r i t t e n  in a ~ r ~ c ~ d u r a 3  
language,line PLANNER. I shall r e t u r n  to this last pifit la te r .  
5. Second Generation Svstems 
To und'ewstand what was meant when Winograd contrasted h i s  own w i t h  
what he called second generation systems, we have to remember, as always 
in this s u j e c t ,  that the generations are of fashion, n o t  chronology or 
inheritance uf i3eas. He dedcribed the work of Simmons, Schank and myself 
among others in h i s  s-ey of new approaches, even though t h e  foundations 
and terminology of those approaches were set out i n  p r i n t  i n  1966, 1968 and 
1967 respectiyely, What those approaches, and others  have in mmon is 
the b e l i e .  t h a k  understanding systems must be able to manipulate very 
complex linguistic ohjects, or semantic structures ,  and t h a t  no simplistic 
approaches to understanding language w i t h  computers will wrk. 
In a very inf luential  recent paper, Minsky (1974) has drawn together 
strands in the work of Charniak (1972) and the authors above using a 
teminolagy of 'frames': 
tvA frame is a data-structure for representing a stereotype situation, 
like a certain kind of l iv ing  room, or going to a children's birthday 
party, Attached tea each frasne are several kinds of information. Sbme 
of thia is information about how to use the frame, Somc is about what 
cne can e x p c t  to happen next, Some is about what to do if those ax- 
pectatione are not confimed. 
We can think of a frame as a network of nodes and relations. The 
top levels of a frame are fixed and represent things that  are always true 
about the supposed situation. The lower levels have many terminals --- 
'slots1 that must be filled by specif ic  instarices or data. Each terminal 
can specify conditions its assignments must meet .... Simple conditions 
a r e  specif ia by markers that might require a terminal assignment to be a 
person, an object of sufficient value, e t c . . , ,  I I  
The key point about, such stxuotures is that they attempt to specify 
in advance what is going to be said,  and how the world encountered is 
goihg to be structured. The structures, and the inference r u l e s  that 
apply to them, ate also expressions of 'partial information '  (in MKarthyts 
phrase) that  are not present in f irs t  generation systems. As I showed 
aarliar, with the 'women and soldiers' example, such loose inductive inform- 
ation, seeking confirmation E r o m  the surrounding context, is required for 
very s h p l e  sentences. In psychological and v i sua l  terms, frame approaches 
~nv isage  cnn undezstander as at ieast as much a looker a? a seer. 
Thus, w e  might, very tentatively, begin by i d e n t i f y i q  what Winograd 
called 'second generation' approaches with those making use 05 very 
general notions akin to what Minsky called 'frames'. But this is no more 
than a temporary device, for convenient initial classification of the field, 
because later we shall have reason to question the  first-second generation 
distinction, and, as noted earlier, Minsky's notion of 'frame' is itself a 
highly f h i d  one in the process of definition and refinemgnt. 
L e t  us now turn briefly to five approaches that might be called 
sewnd generation. 
Charniak 
The new work which owes most to Mirrsky I s  advocac,y is Ckarnink s . 
Hea studied what: sorts uf in forez i t i i z l  infomation Charnlak 7 ' 7 3 ,  ''741

and AJ% that sehso tu understirrail t.htxu. Orla  of h i s  ex,mgic, ' otouicls  ' is: 
'Jane was invited tu Jack's birt l~day p a r t y .  She w n d e r d  if he w u l d  
like a kite. A friend tcld June that  Jack already had a k i t e ,  an3 that 
ha would m k u  her take it back 
it refers to the f i rs t  k i t s  uasrti~ned c?r tha se~wnd.  Charniakts analysis 
begins by p i r a t i n g  out that a great deal cf what is required to understand 
that story is implicit: Iun~ilrledge aLwut the giving of p~esents, knoililedge 
that if one possesses one of a certain s o r t  of thing then one may well not 
want another, and *so on, 
Charniak's system does n o t  actually run as a preyram, but is a theoset- 
i ca l  s t r u c t u r e  of rules called 'demcnsl khat correspond roughly to what 
Minsky later called frames. A demon for this exanple would be,  If we sop 
that a person might not like a present S ,  then lock Pclr S being r e t u r n e d  t o  
the store where it was bought. Zf we st?e t ha t  hngfening, or even being  
suggested, zssert that thp rcasor why is th t  P docs not like S 1 .  
The i m p r t a n t  wards these are 'lt-k f e y ' ,  which suggest that t 3 1 r > r ~  may 
w e l l  bo conf i rming  hints to be found in the :=tory and, i f  t4lerc are, than 
this tentative, partial, inference is cursect, and we have a def in i t e  and 
cor rec t  answer. "I'his approach, of using partial { n o t  necessar i ly  true) 
inferences,  i n  order  to assex t  a definite answer, is highly c h a r a c t e r i s t i c  
of 'second generat ion'  systems. 
The demons are,  as with Winoyraa's work, expressed i n  a procedural 
language which, on running, will seek for a succession of inter-related 
'goals'. 
Here, for example, is a demon concerned w i t h  another story ,  about a 
child's piggy bank (PB) and a child shaking it, looking fcr money b u t  hear- 
ing no sound. The demon, PB-OUT-OF, is fomalised as: 
[DEMM PB-CUT-QF 
(Horn PB PERsW M N) 
{?N Ollfi-OUM 7PB) 
EWAL ( 7  IS ?PB PIGGY-BANK)) 
(GOAL (3 IS 324 K N E Y )  qDEDWE) 
(GOIIL (?NOID S W  ?PERSON 3PB) $TRUE) 
(ASSERT (? HAVE: ?PERSON ?M) 
(ASSERT ('3 RESULT ?N WOLD) ) ) 
Again, it i s  not necessary to explain the notation i n  detail. to see 
that conditions are being stated for the contents of a piggy bank having 
k e n  emptied. The pattern being sought by the demon i n  operation is tire 
third l i n e .  TE a c h i n  of demons can 'reacht one of the passiblo xafer- 
ente i n  a story then there is a suct+ass registered and the ambiguity of 
the corresponding pronoun is resolved. 
It can be seen that the information encoded in the system is of a 
highly specific sort - in the present case it is not about containers as 
such, and how to g e t  their contents out, but about Piggy B a n k s  in particular, 
and everything relies on that partfcular knowledge having been put i n .  N o t  
a l l  the knowledge is of this general sort: in a recent paper (Charniak '74) 
whws tha ' k i t e '  stary is reconsidered there are rules ~f considerable gan- 
rrrsuty snd interest. One such is that Charniak calis a R+SSA rule: 
'XE the  .tory give8 information which would make it plausible to infer 
mt PERSON is favourably inclined towards action A, and PERSON does S I  a 
signif i c m t  subaction (SSA) of A, then f nfer that PERSON is doing A 
An important azsumption of Charniakls is what I shal l  call  his 
'decoupling assunaption', namely that this work on the knowledge-based 
detemahation of reference can be effectively decoupled from any partichlar 
syntactic or semantic representation, or of its apgdication, arid can be 
explored Fn isolation. Thus, the apparently English words in the PB-OUT-OF 
d-n above do not have any particular status ower than that of English 
words that happen ta occur in the stories being examined. I shall r e tu rn  
to this assumption later. 
Corny has (Colby et a1 '71), (Enea and Colby ' 73 ) ,  (Colby and Parkison, 
'74) developed over a pezfod of several years an on-line dialogue system

Colby's stm was to produce a systtm that  was not fragile' in t h e  way 
that most A . I .  systems are: one that did not break dawn, a t  give up, if 
We input was not exactly what it expected; but m e  that carried en scam- 
haw in a11 circumstances, in the way t h a t  conversing humans do. 
Fragility is avoided by having m conventional syntax analyser, and 
by xiot even attempting to take account of all tihe mrds in the input. This 
is a considerable aid,  since any parsex that begins to parse a more #an 
usually polite request such as 'Would you be so kind as to ...* ' is going 
to be in trouble. British English speakers arriving in the U i S .  quickly 
learn to delete such phrases, since they cause great confusion to human 
listeners in stores. 
The input t e x t  is segmented by a heuris t ic  that breaks it at any 
occurrence of a range of key words. Patterns are then matched with each 
segment. There are at present about 1700 pattesns on a list (Colby and. 
Parkison, in pxess) that is stored and matched, not against any syntactic 
or semantic repfesentations of words but against the 'input ~ m r d  *string 
directr and by a process of sequential deletion. So, for example, "What 
i s  your main problemr' has a root verb "BE' substituted to became 
WHAT BE YOU WIN PTtOBLBH, 
ft is then matched awcessively in the following farms after successive 
deletion6 :

WHAT YOU WIN PROl3LW 
WHhT BE MAIN PROBLEM 
WHAT EIE: YOU PROBLEM 
WHAT BE XKl W I N  
ond only We p p u l t h a t e  l i n e  exists as one of the stored patterns, and so 
i8 wrtchd,  Stored i n  the same famat as the patterns are rules expressing 
the conrepuenc3a for the 'patient1 of detecting aggression and over-friend- 
Liness in the intanrlewer's questions and remarks. The matched patterns 
Pound b e  then tied direct ly ,  or via these inference rules, to response 
patterns which are generated. 
Enormous inyenyity has gone into the heuristics of this system, as its 
popularity t e s t i f i e s .  The system has also changed considerably: it is n o w  
calltad PARRY2 and contains the above pattern-aratchinq, rather uan earlier 
key Wrkt heuriatica. It has the partialt or what scme would call 'prag- 
m t f ~ ~ ,  rule& about wpctation and intention, 9ndvthese alone might qualify 
it as 'swmn8 genarqtion' on some interpretations of the phrase. A genexa- 
tor i+ alro being instaXLd to avoid the production of only *lcannedl re- 
mponsas . 
Colby and his associates have put considerable energy i n t o  actually 
wing to find out  whether or not psychiatrists can distinguish PARRY'S 
re8ponaes fran those of a patient (Colby and Hilf '73). This is probably 
the first  attempt actually to apply Turing's t e s t  og machine-person disting- 
u l s h b i l i t y .  There are statistical difficulties about interpreting the 
results but, by and laxye, the result is that the sample questioned cannot 
distinguish the two, Whether or not this w i l l  influence those who still, 
on principle, bel~eve that PARRY is not a simulation because it 'does not 
understand', r a i n s  to be seen. It might be argued that they are in

Simmons1 w x k  is of ten  thought of as a ' r ~ e a o r y  Wed', though he dees 
in fact wy tsbore attention to wrd sense &iguit la ,  and ts actual recog- 
n i t i o n  in t ex t  than do many other authors. For !:in the E u n h c n t a l  ncscian 
is that of a 'soarantic networkq, defined aussntialfy bp the sratxmnt of 
relational triples qf f ~ m r  aRb, where R is the name ut a relatlou and s and 
b are the names of nodes in the network. Shmorts' w r k  w i t h  this general 
formalism goes back to at least ( S h a m s  et al ' 6 6 )  but,  in its never fern

'73) may reasonably be considered a further implementation of Simmns' 
methods. 
Simmons considexs the example sentence 'John broke +the window w i t h  a 
hamer' .  This is analysed into a network of nodes C1, C2, C3, Cd corres- 
ponding to the appropriate senses of 'John1, 'Bread', 'Windcv' and 'Hammer' 
respectively.  The linkages between the nodes are labelled by one of the

actant (CAI) of the breaking, the hammer is consideted the second causal 
actant (mi?) of that breaking, and the window is the theme of the breaking. 
Thuss the heaxt o f  the analysis could ba repzesented by a diagram as followd: 
' John C2 
OF by a s e t  of relational triples: 
(Cl CAS C2) (Cl CAZ C4I C C ~  l?HE&E. C3) 
Huwwer, thisis not the f u l l  representation, and my addition of the word 
1-1s to the diagram is misleading, since the nodes m e  intended to be 
nar~ea of senses of wozds, related ta the actual occurrence of the corxes- 
porufing wad in a text  by tho relation TOK (for token), In an inrplemnt- 
atfon, a node would have an arbitrary name, such as L97, which would then 
rumit a stared sense definition. %, for a sense of 'apple Shmanrr suggests 
an ao~otiated set of featwes: NBR-singular ( S ) ,  SHAPE-spherical, COLOR-red, 
PRINTTHAGS-apple, THEME-eat, etc. If the name of the node tied to t h i s  s ~ t  
of features was iweed L97, then that  W e  might becane, say, 6 5  on being 
brought i n t o  s a a  sentence representation during parsing. Thus the diagram 
1 gave must be thought of supplemented by othez relational ties fram the 
nodes; so that the.ful1 sentence about John would be represented by the 
larger set of triples: 
(Cl TOK break1 (C1 C A l  C2) (Cl TEIEf3E C3) (Cl -2 C4) 
(C2 TOK J o h )  (C2 DET Pef) (C2 NBR S) 
(C3 'ToK Window) (C3 DET Def) (C3 NBR S; 
(C4 TOK Bamer) (CC DET Indef) (C4. NBR S) (C4 PREP With) 
Wxd eense ambiguity i~i taken account of in that the node for one sense 
of 'hamaex' would be different fram that corresponding to some other sense of

as follows:

This case inference muSF b~ made, according to Schank, i n  order to achieve 
an admate  zepresentation. There i s ,  in the last diag~am, a cextain re- 
dundancy of expression, but as w e  shall see tn the next section this often 
happens w i t h  deeper semantic notations. 
More recently, Schank, together with Rieger, has developed a new class 
of causal inferences which deepen the diagrams still  further. So, in the 
analysis of 'John's cold improvPQ1 because I gave him an vp le l  (Lrt Scfrank 
'74a) the extended diagram contains at I h ~ t  four yet lower levels of 
causal =rowing, including one corresponding L.ht the notion of J u h  can- 
s+Ncting the idea (WBUTLD) that he wants to ea% an apple. So we can see 
that the undexlying explication of mean* here is not only i n  the serlso of 
Iinpulistlc prLmltLws, but i n  tern of a theory of mental acts as w e l l .  
N o w  Ulsra ate  a number of genuine ~pos i t i6na] .  difficulties here for 
the euml&tator faced w i t h  a epstm of this complexity, One aspect of 
t h i ~  is the atages of d e v e l o p n t  pf the ~ y s t a m  i tself ,  which can bc seen 
ae a consimtcntpmcesa of produrlng what was argued for i n  advance. For 
ekampla, Schank claimed early on to be a constructing system of semantic 
mtructures undatlyirrp the 'surface of natural language', alehaugh initially 
them were no primitives at all, and qa late as (Schank et a1 '70) there 
was only a single primitive TRANS, and most of the entries in the dictionary 
conmisted of the Bnylish wards coded, together with subscripts. Since than 
the primitive system has b&ossomed and &ere are now twelve primitives tor 
hCTS including three Ebr the original TRANS itself .  Each axposition of the 
system recounts its preceding phrases, from the original primitive-free one, 
throuqh to the present causal inference  form; rather as each human foetus 
is said to relive in the womb a l l  the evolutionqy stages of the  human race. 
The only trouble w i t h  this, f x m  an outsider's point  of view, is khat at 
each stage the representation has been claimed, to be the correct one, while 
at the same ti- S c h d  admits, in moments of candor (Schank '731,  that 
there is no a d  to the conceptual diagrrVbraing oE a sentence. This d i f f i -  
culty m y  well reflect genuine problems in language itself, and, in its 
acuteat form concerns a three-way confusion between an attractive notat ion 
for displaying the 'meanings of wordsv, the course of events i n  the real 
world, a d ,  f i n a l l y ,  iibtual procedures for analysis to be based on the 
diagrams, 
This raises the ,  to me, inrportant question of the  application of a 
semantkc system, that I shall touch on again later. Schank, for example, 
dues mention i n  passing the questions of wd-sense ambiguity, and the  awful 
ambiguity of English prepositions, but there are in no way central for him, 
and he assumes that w i t h  the availability of 'the correct repxesentationWt 
h i s  s y s h  when UnpleIm?nted must inev i tab ly  soive th- traditional and vex- 
ing questions. M procedures are hinted at along w i t h  the graphs as to 
how tnrs is to be done. A d i s t i n c t i o n  cof importance may be becoming ap- 
parent here batween Schank s work and Riegerls: in Riagar's thesis ( R L q e r  
'74) the rules of inference appear to craatg clclparata and new rubprrphr 
wnicn may s w d  in an lnfersntial celatlon to each other so as tsl produce

In a mra recent publication CSchank '74b) there are signs that this. 
trend of infinitely prol i fera t ing  diagrams (for i n d i v i h a l  sentences) is 
feversing. I n  it Schank considsrs the application of h i s  approach to the 
repraqentation of text ,  and concl :des, correct ly  i n  my tP4etq ,  that the rep- 
resentations of pa r t s  of the t e x t  must be interconnected. by causal arrows, 
and that, i n l o r d m  to present@ 1rv.cidity, the conceptual diagrams for indi- 
vidoal sentences and their partvi must be abbreviatedr as by triples such as 
POEPLE P p l W S  PEOPLE.  her^ indeed, the surface simply has to su rv iw  i n  
-
the representation un1esF one is prepared t o  camit oneself to the axeme 
view that the ordering OF sentences i n  a text is a purely superf ic ia l  and 
arbitrary matter. The F e n s e i n  wnich this is a welcome reversal of a trend 
should be clear, because i n  the 'causation inference' development, mentioned 
earlier, all the consequences and ef fec t s  oE a conceptualization had t o  be 
-
drawn within i t s e l f .  Thus, i n  the extreme case, each sentence of a t e x t  
7 
should have been represented by a diagram containing most or  a l l  of We 
t e x t  of which it was a part. Thus- the representation of a t e x t  would haye 
been impossible on such prihciples.  
Pay own system constructs a semantic representation f o r  small natural  
language texts: the basic representation is applied d i r ec t l y  t o  the text 
and can then be 'massaged' by various forms of inference t o  became as deep 
as is necessary for well defined tasks demonstrating understanding. It 
is a uniform representation, in that information that might convenionall~ 
be considerea as syntactic, s-ntic, factual ox rnrerencial LS weu ax- 
pressed within a single type o f  struwra. The fundamental un i t  i n  the 
mnatructioe of th2s beaning representation is the template, which is 
intmded to correspond to an intuitive notion of a basic message of 
agent-action-object fom. Templates are rigid format networks of more 
basic butldlnp blocks called fomulas, which correspond t o  senscln of 
individual worde. In order to cohskruet a cctnplete t e x t  representation 
templates ate  bound byethat by t w o  kinds of higher level structures 
called p a p l a t e s  and inference rules. The templates themselves are 
built up as the construction of  the representation proceeds, but the. 
formulas, paraplates and jlnference rules are all present in the system,at 
the outset and each of these three types of pre-stored structure is ult- 
irpately constructed frm an inventory of eighty semantic primitive elements, 
and from functions and predicates ranging over those elements. 
The system runs on-line as a package of LXSP, k&ISP and MLISP2 pro- 
gram, W i n g  as input small paragraphs of English, that can -be made up by 
the uber from a vocabulary of about 6QO word senses, and p r d u z f n g  a good 
French t:ransL&tion as output. This environment provides a pretty clear 
tea t  of lmguage undarstding, bcauaa E'rench translations for everyday. 
pmse are either right or wmng, and can be seen' t o  be 910, while a t  the same 
titPe, the mfot difficulttee of understanding ptogtams - word sense ambig- 
ratty, case anbigufty, difficult pronoun reference, etc. - can a l l  be rep- 
resented within a machine translation environment by, for example, choosing 
the words of Lhe input sentence containing a pronoun reference difficulty 
so t h & E  the potsible alternative references have different genders in French. 
In that way the French output mdkes quite clear whether or not the program 
has made the correct inferences in order to understand what it is trans- 
la_ting. The program is reasonably robust in agtual prformance, and w i l l  
even tolerate a certain amount ob bad grammar in the input, since it does 
not pzfbm a syrkax a ~ L y s I ; s  &=%he sense, hut snnkn message 
forms representable &XI the semantic s m c t u r e s  employed. 
v p i c a l  input would ble a sentence such as 'John l i v e s  out: QE tQtm hi 
&inks his wine out of a bottle, Mo than throws the h t t l a s  out uf Uae 
for each of tke thraa occurrences of 'out o f t ,  since i t  raslisarrs that they

These two e x m p h  are dealt w i t h  i n :  t h e  'basic d e '  of the system. 
(Wilks 73a) Inmany cases itcmotxesolve pronoun ambiguities by the 
sort of straightforward 'preference considerations1 used in t h e  last exaaple, 
where, roughly speaking, 'ripeness' prefers to &-predicated of plant-like 
things, and hunger of animate things, Even in a sentence as s b p l e  as 
'John drank the wine on the table and it was g d t t  such considerations 
aye inadequate to resolve the anbigtlity of 'it' between wine and table, 
since both m y  be good things. In such cases, 02 i n a b i l i t y  to ras~lve 
with in  its basic moder the program deepens the xepresentatio~ of the t e x t  
so as to t q  and s e t  up chains of inference that will reach, and su prefer, 
only one of the possible referents. I w i l l  return to these pzocesses in 
a nment ,  but first I s h a l l  give sane brief description of the basic repre- 
sentat ion s e t  up for English. 
For each sense of a word in its dictionqxy the program sees a fohula .  
This is a tree structure of semantic primitives, and is to be interpreted 
formally using dependency relations. The main element i n  any fonnula is 
the rightmost, called its head, and that is  the fundamental category to 
which the fonnula belongs, In the formulas for actions, for example, 
the head will always be one of the primitives PICK, CAUSE, CHANGE, FEEL, 
HAVE, PIXME, PAIRl SENSE, USE, ,WANT, TELL, BE, 5X), FQRCE, W, 
- 
THINk, FLOW, W, DROP, STRZK, FUNC or HAPN. 
Here 18 t n t s  eLee stxuctufe for the. action of drinking: 
( m u  PART) 
Qace again, it is n ~ t  necessary to explain the formalism in any deta i l ,  
to see that this sense of Idrink* is being expressed as a causing to mve 
a liqyid object (F'WH m) by an animate agent, into that saine agent (con- 
tainment case indicated by IN, and formula syntax identifies SELF w i t h  thB 
+gent) and via (direction case) an aperture (TLIRU PART) of the agent. 
Template structures, which actually represent sentences and their 
parts are built up as netwcrks of formulas like the one above. Templates 
always cons ia t  o f  an agent nude, and action node and an object node, and 
other: nodes ttat laay depend on these. Sot in building a template for 
'John drinks,wine', the whole of the above tree-formula for 'drinks'  would 
be piaced at the central action node, another tree structure for 'John' at 
the agent node and so on. The complexity of the system comes from the way 
i n  which the formulas, considered as active entities, dictate how other 
places hn the same template should be filled. 
Thus, the 'drink1 formula above can be thought of as an entity that 
fits at a template action node, and seeks a liquid object, that is ~ say 
a f~rmula w i t h  (FLOW STUFF) as its right-most bzanch, to put at the object 
noda of the same template. This seeking is preferential, in that formulas 
not satisfying that requirement will be accepted. but only if nothing

ordered stxuctues,  essentially equivalen* to FMlrPore s case f ruses, called 
prap la te s  and which are a t t a h e a  t~ the formulas for English prepositions8. 
SO, for 'outof', for =aaple ,  there h-ould be at Least six ordered paraplates, 
each of which Is a string of functions that seek inside templates for inform- 
ation. In general, paraplates range across t w o ,  nat necessarily contiguous, 
templates. So, in analysing 'He put the n u h r  he thought of i n  the table ' ,  
the successfully matching paxaplatz would p i n  down the  dependence OP the 
template for the last of the three clauses a s  DIREctior., by W i n g  as  amp- 
ment only that particular template for the l a s t  clause that contained the 
formula for 'a numerical table' ,  (and - not  a template repxesenting a kitchen 
table) and a t  would do that because of a function i n  that paraplate seeking 
a similarity, of head (SIGN in this case) between the t t~m appropriate objecr, 
ConqularJ for ~numbarl and 'tabla'. The other template cumtaining the 
tfurnftuzsq formula for 'table* would naturally not satisfy the function

H O W ~ V ~ X ,  wmy exmples cannot be resolved by the methods of this 
'baeic mode' and, in particular, if a ward sense arPbiguity, or pronoun 
reference, i~ still unresolved, then a unique semantic block of  templates 
canrnot be constructed and the 'extended mode' will be entered." In this 
&a, new template-like forms are extracted fran existing ones, and then 
added to M e  template pool ftom which further inferences can be made. So, 
i n  Ula t m ~ l a t a  derived earlier for 'John drinks wine ' ,  the system enters 
the Loarula for 'drinks', and draws inferences corresponding to coach case 
sub-Eorrmula. In this t~xtmple it will derive template-like forms equivalent 
to, in omJf~ry English, 'The wine is in J o b t ,  'The wine entered John via 
an aperture' and so on. The extracted templates express information a l -  
ready implicitly preser.t i n  the text, wen though many of them are partial 
inferences: anes that may not necessaxily, be true. 
-n-sense inference rules are then brought down, which attempt, by 
a s-fe strertegy, ta construct the shortest possible chain of rule-linked 
tmmplate fo-8 from one containing an ambiguous pronoun, say, 50 one c2n- 
t a i n h g  one of its ~ s s i b l e  referents. Such a chain then constitutes a 
solution ta the ambiguity problem, and the preference approach assumes that 
the shartest chain is always [the right one. So, Yn the case of 'Jahn drank

radiating out Ex- the head i n  the centre, then the two  diagtsms actually 
have identical topologies under interpretation. A difference vises in 
that the 'filled-in entity' for Schgnk is the conceptualization centred 
on the basic action, though for me it is the network oE formulas placed in 
relation La a t ~ l o p L a t e ,  whexe there is indeed a basic action, the he& of 
the action formula, but there is also a basic entity i n  the agent formula 
and SO on. OX, to put FL another way, both what-is and what-is-expected 
are represented in the templates: the agent formula represents the agent, 
Pox exampla, but the left-hand pact of the action formula alsp represent3

required by a language understanding system. 
Centrality 
What X aria calling the centrality of certain kinds of information con- 
cerns not its level of representation but its non-specifidty: again a 
contrast can be dram between the sorts of infomiltion required by Charniakls 
s ~ s t ~ ,  0x1 on@ hand, and that required bySchankls* and my o m  on the 
obhar. Charniak's examples suggest that .the fundemental form of information 
is highly spacific** to  particular situations,  Like parties and the giving of 
presents, while the sorts a? information central to Schank's and my own 
systems are general partial hssertions a b u t  human wants, expectations, and 
scr on, m y  of which' are so general as to be almost vacuous which, one misht 
argue, is why their zple i n  understanding has been ignored for so long. 
- 
* Though as noted earlier, Schank in 1975 has adopted Rbelson9s (1973) 
notion of 'script', as a largar-scale 'frame1, in such a way as to in- 
corporate much less 'central1 knowledge. 
**In a recent paper (1974), Charniak gives much more general-rules, such 
as his 'rule of significant sub-action', mentioned earliw.

language in which it was written,  These az'e certainky wnrL3exatians that

Charniak has concehtrated on something as general as childtents stories, 
w i t h  their need of deep assumptions about hurwn desires and khaviour.  
In the end 'this difference may again turn out to be one of enphasisj 
and of what is most appropriate to diSSerent subject areas', though there 
niay be a vexy general issue lurk iw somewhere here. It seems to me not a 
fuolish question to ask whether much of what appears to be about natural 
language in A.I. research is in fact about language a t  all, Even if it 
is nbt that may in no way detract fran its value. Newell (blolore, Newoll 
q 7 3 )  has argued that A . 1 .  work is in fact 'theoretical psychology', in 
which case it ceul8 hardly be research - on natural language, When describ- 
ing Winograd's work earlier in the paper, Z raised this question in a weak 
farm by asking whether his definition o f  Ipickup1 had anything to da with 
the natural language use of  the word, or whether it was rather a description 
of how his system picked samething up, a quite different matter. 
Suppose we generalize this query samewhat, by asking the apparentky 
absurd question of what would be wrong w i t h  cal l ing,  say, Charniakls work 
an essay on the 'Socio-Economic Behaviour of American Children Under Stress? 
I n  the case of Charniak's work this i s  a facetious question, asked only in 
order to make a point, but with an increasing number of systems in A . I .  
being designed not essentially to do research on natural language, but i n  
order to have a natural language ' f ron t  end' to a s y s t m  that is essentially 
intended to  predict chemical spectra, or play snakes and ladders or whatever 
the question becomes a serious one. It seems to me a good time to ask 
whether we ahould expect advance in understanding natural language from 
those tackling the problems head on, or those coroncerned to build a 'fr8nt 
andv. It i~ cLtt,xly the case that - a n p i e c e  coulL 
bp esrcntial to the understanding of sane story. The question is, does 
it follow that the epehifict.tion, organieation and formalization of that 
knowldge l a  &a studf oP l : . a g a ,  because i f  it is then all human enquiry 
ftm physics and history to medicine is a linguistic enterprise. And, of 
cowrr,  that poaskbil i ty has actually been entertained within certain strains  
of d a r n  philosophy. 
itowaver, I am not w i n g  hefa, to breathe fresh life into a philosophical 
distinction,  batween being aLuut lmpunge and - not being about language, but 
tather introducing a practical distinction, (which is also a consideration 
in favour of optiqg, a3 I have, to work on very general and central areas 
of howledge) between specific knowledge, and central knowledge without 
which a syartem could not be said to unilexsttind the language at a l l .  For 
1 
example, I might know nothing of the arrangement of American birthday 
parties, but could not be accused of not understanding English even though I 
failed understand sme pazticular 'children's story. Yet, if I did not 
have available acme very general partial inference such as the ane people 
bainq hurt an8 fallingr or one about people e*avouring to possess things 
that they w a n t ,  then it quite possible that my lack of understanding of 
quits airtple aentencee would cause observers to think that I did not under- 
r W  Englbsh. An interesting and difficult question that then arises i s  
whether those who concentrate on central and less central areas of discouse 
could, i n  principle, weld their bodies of inferences together in such a :gay 
as to create a wider system: whether, to put the matter another way, 
natural language is a whole that can be built up fxm parts? 
Pken-noloqica level 
Another distinction that can be confused w i t h  the central-specific 
one is that of the lphencmenological levels1 of inferences in an under- 
standing system. I mean nothing daunting by the phrase: consider the 
action eating which is, as smatter of matmica1 fact, quite often an 
act of bringing the bones of my ulna and radius (in my arm) close to that 
o f  my lower mandible (my jaw). Yet clearly, any syatQIP OP CCEPgeK).n sense 
inferences that considered such a truth when reasoning about eating would 
be making a mistake. One might say Ulat the phenoeenolqtcrl lrvrL of 
the anraly_sis was m n g  even thourgh all the InF'amznces it: !!ad8 ware Uue 
ones, The stme wuld  be true of any W . I .  system that wade everyday 
inferences about physical objects by mnsiQaring their quantum structure. 
Schank's analysis of eating rontaias the  inf'matian &st it  la  done 
by uovirsg the hands to the mukh, and it might be argued that yven ulis is 
goisrg too far ftom the '@aaningl of eating, whataver that m y  bar towsrds

a U  acts of qating, w i l l  carry the systesrs nruamageably fax. 
Therq is no denying that t h i s  sort of infomatioar might be useEul to 
have around somewhere; Wt, in Minsky's terms, the 'default1 value of the 
instrument for eating i s  the  hand brought to the mouth, so that,  if we have 
no contrary infomation, then that is the way to a s s u e  that any g f v m  a c t  
of eating was performed. Nonetheless, there c l e a r l y  is a danger, and t h a t  
is a l l  X am drawing at tent ion to here, of taking inferences to a phenolnencw 
ldgical level beyond that of uammn sense. A clearer case, in my view, 
would be Schank's analysis (1974a) of mental. act iv i ty  in which a l l  actions, 
such as kicking a ba l l ,  say, are preceded by a rsrenta9 action af conc~iving 
or deciding to kick a b a l l .  This is clearly a level of ana lys i s  untrue to 
c a u m n  sense, and which can have only harmful effects in a systea intended 
to mimic corxlaPon sense reasoning and understanding. 
Demupling 
Another general issue in dispute concerns what I shall c a l l  demupling, 
which i s  whethex ox not  the actual parsing of t e x t  or dialogue into an 'under- 
standing system.' is essential. Charniak and Minsky b e l i e v e  that t h i s  in- 
itial 'parsing1 can be effectively decoupled from the in teres t ing  i n f e r e n t i a l  
work and simply Qssumed. But, in my view, that is n o t  so, because many of 
the later inferences would actually have to be done already, i n  order to have 
achieved the initial parsing. For example, i n  analysing 'He shot her with a 
colt', we cannot ascribe any structure at all until we'can make the infexences 
that guns rather than horses are instruments fo r  shooting, and so such a 
sentence cannot be represented by an 'inference-but-no-parsing' structure, 
without aremi- that language doas not have one of its esgential char- 
aeteristlca, namely ayptemrrtie ambiguity. The essence of decoupling is 
allowing roprersntational etructures to have significance quite  indtlpend- 
ant of theirapplication, and that may lead one to a eituatMh lot 
essentially ditfstont frm that of the logician who simply asserts that 
ouch-and-much ie the 'right structuxel of sme sentence. 
The inferences required t o  resolve word aense ambiguities, and those 
ad tb reaolva pronoun reference pxobletast are not of different typos1 
oftan the two pmblaas occur i n  a eingle sentence and must be resolved to- 
gether. But Chatniak's decoupling has the effect of completely separating 
these two closely related liniguistic phenomena i n  what seems to me an un- 
raallstic aanner. H i s  system does inferencing to resolve pronoun ambig2 
uttfes ,  while sense ambiguity is presumably to be done in the future by 
sapre other, ulti.mately remupled, syste'~.*  
Wodulari ty 
Madularity concerns the deccwposability af a firogran or system i n t o  
(interacting) parts, and fhe nature of the relationship between t+e parts. 
Winograd's program, as we saw, contains syntactic, semantic and deductive 
BegmentJ which interact in a way he describes as 'heterarchicl (as oppo$ed 
to 'hierarchic8) which means that different w e n t s  can be in controlaat 
d i f  foreht tiswc . 
Qn the other hand, S c W  and W i l k s  have argued that it is n o t  nec- 
esaaty ta absarve efther the syntactic-semantic, or the semantic-deductive, 
dlatfnctlon i n  an understanding program. On that view there 0 no par- 
t;icular,virtue i n  integrating syntax and semantic rbutlnes, since +here was 
no need tm separate them. 
Charniak, h ~ ~ v e r r  w b l d  argue tha t ,  in same sensg, one should makq 
a syntax-setplantics distinction here if one c+n. This would be consisterit 
with his view on decoupling, and for him it wuld  be convenient to de- 
couple at a module, as it were, such as syntactic analysis. But decoup-

In one of his recent papers 91974bI Schank sems to have accepted s m e  
limitation on the abandonment Of surface structuse. 
The other, practical, p i n t  concerns t h e  form of representation em-

f i ca l ly  associated^ w i t h  t he  i n p u t  word? Schank clearly believes the 
answer to this question is yes, but that cannot be considered established 
by the scale of cmputat ions yet described in print. 
A suitable envir-ent in which to consider tke question is that  of 
translation from one language to another: suppose we are analyging a

actually to be applied to English prepositions in tex t .  So, for example, 
the preposition *in1 can correspond to the containment case, time location,

whether one should m a k e  massive 
forward inferences as one goes through a tex t ,  keeping a l l  one's expect- 
ations intact, as Charniak and Schank hold, 0s whether, as I hold,, one 
should adopt some 'laziness hypothesis1 &ut understanding, and generate 
deeper inferences only  when the system is unable to salve, say a referential 
problem by mre superEicia1 methods. Of, in other terns, should an under- 
standing system be ~roblern-, or data-, driven. 
* This i s  not meant to be j u s t  bland assertion. I have written at same 
length on the relations between application and the theoretical status 
of linguistic theories in (Wilks ' 74 ) .  
**The differences between Minsky's (19741 notion of 'default value' and 
what I have called 'prefexence' can be pointed up in terms of application. 
M h s Q  suggests 'gunt as the default value of the instrument of %he action 
of shooting, but I would claim that, in an example like the earlier 'He 
shot her w i t h  a colt ' ,  we heed to be able to see in the structure assigned 
whether or not  what is offered as the apparent instrument is in fact an 
instrument and whether it 'is the default or riot. In other words, we need 
sufficient structure of application to see not only that 'shcotlng1 pre- 
fers an instrument &at is a gun, but also why it will chaose the sense 
of 'colt1 thatcis a gun rather than the one which is a horse. 
ATtlx>ugh Schank sametinee writes of a system making 'all possible1 
inferences a8 it p10ceBd8 though a textt this i e  not in fact the heart 
o t  tho dispute, since no one would want ta defend my atmng definittior 
oL the tom 'all poesibla infetences'. Chacniakqs argument 4s that, un- 
less certain  fornard inferences w e  made during an analysis o f r  say, a 
e - ry  - forward inferencest that is, that are not problem-driven; not 
made in rerrpcnss ta any particular problem of analy.ysia then known to the 
ayrtsm - than, ar a matter of empirical fact, the system will not in 
general be able to  solva srPbiguity or rofetence ptoblems that arise later, 
because it will never in fact be possible t o  locata (while looking back- 
wards a t  the text,  as i t  were) the points Ohere those forward inferences 
ought to have been made. This i s r  in very crude summary, Charniak's case 
against a purely ptoblw-driven inferencer in a natural language under- 
stander , 
A ditficulty w i t h  this.argument is the location of an axample of text  
that c~nffrms the pofnt in a ncn-contentious manner. Chatniak has found 
an excerpt ftcm a book describing the l i f e  of apes in which it is indeed 
hard to locate the reference of a particular pronoun in a given passagQ. 
Chamiak's case is that it is only possible to do so i f  one has made eert- 
aln inon-prublm occasioned) inferances earliez in the story. But a 
nuabet QE readers find it quite hard tb refer that particuXe pronoun any- 
wayl which might s w e e t  that, the t ex t  was simply badly written.  
Another d i f f i cu l ty  16 that it is not always clear whether the argument 
is about what p p l e  are thought to do when they understand, or about how 
one should mnstruct an wdexstandLng system. This  is a d i f f i c u l t  matter 
about which to be precise: it would be possible, for example, to agree with 
Charniakts argurnentmd still construct a 3urely problem-driven inferencer 
on the ground that, at the mment, t h i s  is the onlv way one can cope with t h e  
vast majority of inferences for understanding, since any system of inferences 
made Fn response to no particular problem in me text  is too hard to control 
in practice. Indeed, it i s  noticeable t h a t  the mst recent papers of Schank 
(1974a and 1974b) and Charniak (1974) have been considerably less forward- 
inference oriented than earlier ones.
