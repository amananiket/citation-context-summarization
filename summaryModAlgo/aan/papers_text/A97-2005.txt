We are concerned with surface-syntactic parsing of 
running text. Our main goal is to describe a syntac- 
tic analysis of sentences using dependency links that 
show the head-dependent relations between words. 
The new dependency parser 1 (Tapanainen and J~ir- 
vinen, 1997; J~rvinen and Tapanainen, 1997) be- 
longs to a continuous effort to apply rule-based 
methods to natural languages. It can been seen 
as a relative of the Constraint Grammar framework 
(Karlsson et al, 1995), for many features of the sys- 
tem have been derived from it. The syntactic de- 
scription in the English Constraint Grammar (ENG- 
CG) is implicitly dependency oriented; it contains 
tags for heads and modifiers but not explicit links 
between them (see Figure 2). 
Although, the new syntactic formalism differs 
much from the Constraint Grammar's formalisms, 
the basic rule types of the older formalism have been 
preserved among the new ones. Also, the rules are 
independent, and they describe syntax in a piece- 
meal fashion. The new dependency parser creates 
explicit links between the elements of the sentence 
(in Figure 1) while still retaining the shallower ep- 
resentation similar to ENGCG (in Figure 2). The 
parser applies the ENGTWOL lexicon designed orig- 
inally by Juha Heikkil? and Atro Voutilainen. Also, 
the reliable parts of the ENGCG's morphological 
disambiguator by Atro Voutilainen are applied. 
The parser has been tested in Sun workstation 
and in PCs under Linux. The syntactic analysis is 
modest in time and space requirements: the size of 
the process (the syntactic analysis only) is less than 
2 MB and it runs in a Pentium 90 MHz machine at 
the speed of 200 words per second. We have tested 
the parser on bigger texts to test its usability in cor- 
pus linguistic and lexicographic work. By now, some 
30 million words have been parsed.

2 The  dependency model 
Our syntactic description can be seen as a formalisa- 
tion of Tesni~re's (1959) original dependency theory. 
The dependency model adopted to our description 
differs in various respects from the post-Tesni~rean 
development of dependency theory, though many of 
the features are recognised elsewhere. The main fea- 
tures of the parsing system and the adopted epen- 
dency theory are: 
? The basic syntactic element is not a word, but 
a nucleus. This is related to the internM organ- 
isation of the grammar, though the default out- 
put shows the dependency links between surface 
words. 
? Every element has one and only one head 
(uniqueness). 
? The result is a tree. 
? Functional dependencies are expressed by link 
names. 
? The links may cross (non-projective construc- 
tions are allowed). 
? Modifiers are not obligatory; valency defines 
possibility rather than obligatoriness tohave ar- 
guments. 
? The grammar is not generative. This means 
that the parser accepts every input sentence, 
and returns an analysis even for ungrammatical 
sentences to the extent he structure is recover- 
able. 
? The dependency description is monostratal, i.e. 
there is one level of syntactic description, the 
surface-syntactic description, and no transfor- 
mations.
