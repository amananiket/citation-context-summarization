Portable Natural Language Generation using SPOKESMAN 
Abstract 1
This paper reports on the SPOKESMAN natural anguage 
generation system, which is a domain independent text gen- 
erator designed to incrementally produce text for an underly- 
ing application program. This work is a direct outgrowth of 
the work we reported on at the last ACL Applied Conference 
in 1988, where we connected an application program directly 
to the linguistic omponent, Mumble-86. The major addi- 
tion has been a new component to the system, a text planner 
that provides the capability to compose the utterance incre- 
mentally. The central feature of the text planning com- 
ponent is a new level of representation that both captures 
more linguistic generalizations and makes the system more 
portable, so that we can easily interface to different domains 
and different kinds of application programs. This larger sys- 
tem is called "Spokesman", as it acts as the mouthpiece for 
a number of application programs. 
1. Introduction 
There are generally two approaches toachieving portabil- 
ity. One is to build peripheral components hat can auto- 
matically or semi-automatically acquire the knowledge 
needed to port to a new domain. The second is to modular- 
ize the system so that the components hat are not domain 
specific are kept separate from those that are, and to try to 
maximize the amount of knowledge in the more general 
components. In the long term, a combination of these 
approaches will certainly be needed. In the work presented 
here, we have concentrated on the later. For example, by 
taking advantage of the fact that most of language isnot par- 
ticular to any domain, we have isolated the linguistic realiza- 
tion component and used the Text Structure to capture 
abstract linguistic generalizations. Also by using the 
knowledge base of the application directly we can not only 
capture generalizations about objects which are expressed 
similarly, but also handle those cases where the means of 
expression is specific to a particular domain. 
2. Modularization 
In our earlier work, generation i volved three modules: a
linguistic realization component (LRC) MUMBLE-86 
(Meteer, et.al 1987), an underlying application program, and 
a special purpose text planner to handle the mapping from 
one to the other. The text planner used the input specifica- 
tion language to Mumble-86 as a means of compensating

1988 Architecture: Interfacing to Mumble-86 
While this modularization isolated the linguistic com- 
ponent, using it directly required ~e developer to be aware of 
very low level linguistic details. For example, the 
specification of a noun phrase requires that information 
about number, person, and determiner be included. 
Furthermore, there was no way to ensure that a particular 
specification built by a text planner would actually be 
expressible by the linguistic component. For example, 
there was no~hing to prevent a planner from composing a
specification combining a completive vent with a duration 
(e.g. *"the plane landed for ten minutes"). Also, the 
specification language itself cannot capture certain 
generalizations about what features can co-occur in language 
and what is expressed by certain combinations of features, 
leaving them to the text planner. For example, a single 
noun phrase with a definite article indicates that the entity is 
known (e.g. "the dog"); however if a proper name is used, 
the article is omitted even when the entity is known (e.g. 
"Fluffy"). 
While this architecture was a successful means of working 
directly with MUMBLE-86, it left a great deal of work to be 
done by the planner, most of which must be built 
specifically for each application. Our approach in 
developing a text planner for the current system was to 
introduce modularity into the text planner, separating what 
is general to language from that which is specific to an 
application. The resulting system is called SPOKESMAN, 
and its architecture is shown below. The general knowledge 
used by the .ext planner esides in the TEXT PLANNER 
CORE; the domain specific portions of the text planner are 
again indicated by diagonal lines. 
Note that three of the applications shown all use the same 
knowledge representation language, the Simple Frame 
Language (SFL, Abrett, et al 1989). Following our overall 
approach of modularizing those portions of the system that 
are shared, we built a subsystem for interfacing with the 
representation language that contains all the routines for 
accessing objects in SFL and for handling what is common 
to all SFL-based applications, uch as the concept THING.

1992 Architecture: The 
Spokesman is essentially an object-oriented program in 
that the routines for mapping from one level to the other are 
specialized for the type of object being mapped, just as 
generic methods in CLOS or Flavors are specialized for dif- 
ferent classes or flavors in those object oriented program- 
ming languages. Each mapping function is a table which, 
when given an object, will walk up the KB hierarchy until it 
finds a routine associated with that object's type or a type it 
inherits from. If that routine is a template, it will execute 
the template; if it is a class of alternatives, it will select one 
and execute that. This process is shown schematically 
below. There are different tables for the mappings between 
each level of representation i  Spokesman, and, in some 
cases, different ables depending on the context defined by 
representational level.

As we discussed earlier, one of our goals has been to iso- 
late what is common to a language (though not necessarily 
all languages) from what is particular to the application the 
generator is speaking for. In particular, we wanted to both 
capture the generalizations available from the cooccurance of
features in the linguistic specification and ensure that the 
specifications that are built are expressible in language. 
Within the text planner core, these generalizations are 
captured in the level of representation called the Text 
Structure (TS), which is used to compose the text. TS is a 
tree representing the constituency of the utterance, where 
constituents may be entire paragraphs related by rhetorical 
relations, or they may be lexically headed constituents 
internal to a clause. The terms of the TS are abstractions 
over the concrete resources of language (words, phrases, 
morphological markers). This vocabulary and the structure 
built with it provides the text planner with a representation 
of what decisions have already been made, thus constraining 
further decisions, and of what opportunities are available for 
further composition. 
3. Captur ing differences between domain 
In what we have presented so far, the focus has been on 
taking advantages of similarities within language and among 
applications to isolate domain independent components from 
those that need to be specific to the application program. 
Spokesman Generation System 
However, there are some things that are intrinsically domain 
specific, both in what information is expressed and in how it 
is expressed. A generation system that is to produce real- 
istic texts in a domain must allow the developer to special- 
ize routines at all levels of the generation process. 
One example of a domain specific expression is the way 
pilots are addressed in the Air Traffic Control domain. 
Rather than using the pilot's name, the controller addresses 
the pilot using the flight ID of the plane the pilot is 
flying--in effect he addresses the plane; similarly, pilots 
address controllers using their function (e.g approach, 
tower). In SPOKESMAN, this is handled using the map- 
pings. Rather than using the mapping for PERSON, which 
pilot inherits from, a mapping specific to the concept 
PILOT is set up, which puts the aircraft instance rather than 
the pilot instance in the resultant Text Structure node. In 
the next phase of the generation process, which maps from 
the text structure to the linguistic specification, the mapping 
from the aircraft to the lexical resource is used, which 
combines the airline and the plane's ID number into a 
phrase, such as "United four fifty one". 
4. Conc lus ion  
We have described the modularization f the SPOKESMAN 
generation system, which is designed to increase its 
portability, and we have briefly shown how the use of 
mappings directly from the application's knowledge base can 
both capture generalities in how information is expressed 
and allow specializations for domain specific expressions.
