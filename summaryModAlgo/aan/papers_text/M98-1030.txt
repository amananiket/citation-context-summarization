The Message Understanding Conference Scoring 
Software User's Manual
Introduction 
The "MUC" Evaluation 
The Message Understanding Conferences (MUCs) are gatherings of researchers in computational linguistics. All 
participants in the conference develop software systems which perform natural language understanding tasks defined 
by the conference committee. The systems are evaluated based on how their output compares with the output of 
human linguists. The MUC scoring software is used in that comparison. 
(This manual will briefly describe the MUC tasks from the standpoint of how the scoring software is used. For 
detailed, up-to-date descriptions of the the tasks, please refer to the various task definition documents for the 
conference.) 
All tasks involve reading in a set of documents from one computer file. The documents contain text from periodicals 
or some other source of natural language, so the input file is called a texts file. The texts file is analyzed, and a set of 
objects is produced and printed to a single output file. For each document in the input file there are, in general, 
several objects produced. The format of the objects varies with the task, although the scorer uses the same internal 
representation of objects for all tasks. 
When the scorer is run, it reads in an output file produced by a human, containing keys, and an output file produced 
by a software system, containing responses. The scorer aligns objects in the key file with objects in the response file. 
It then calculates various scores based on how well the responses agree with the keys. At present, there are two ways 
that the scores are calculated. In four of the five tasks, scores are based on counting how many fills (which are 
substructures of the objects, and are described below) agree for each aligned object. In the coreference task, the 
objects in the key file are grouped into equivalence classes, as are the objects in the response file. Scores for 
coreference are based on how well the equivalence classes agree. 
The Structure of Scorer Objects 
Internally, all objects compared by the scorer have the same basic hierarchical structure. We'll start at the bottom of 
this hierarchy and work our way up to the objects themselves. The figure above shows the terms we will introduce in 
relation to an object from a fictitious information extraction task. 
For scoring, Single fills are treated as "atoms." When objects are aligned, the objects' single fills are also aligned, and 
it is the results of the single fill alignments which are tallied up to get the final score (in all tasks but Coreference). 
There are three types of single fills: 
Set fills 
Strings of characters which must match exactly (except for character case) to be considered "correct". 
String fills 
Strings of characters which must match after some massaging (e.g., removing articles or repeated space or tab 
characters) to be considered "correct". 
Pointer fills 
References to other top level objects. 
A multi-fill is a group of single fills. 
A set of multi-fills is what goes into a slot. Slots in key objects may hold more than one multi-fill. Slots in response 
objects may hold only one multi-fill. When a key slot has more than one multi-fill, each key multi-fill is an 
alternative. The response slot's lone multi-fill will be aligned with whichever multi-fill of the key that results in the 
best score for the alignment. The unaligned multi-fills from the key are then non-committal. A slot also has a name, 
which distinguishes it from other slots in the top-level object. 
A top-level object consists of some identification information and a set of slots. The identification information 
consists of an id string for the document from which the object was extracted (the document number), the object's 
type, and a string which distinguishes that object from all other objects of that type in that document. This string is 
sometimes called the one-up string. 
Input File Formats 
Template Files 
Template files are the files produced in the information extraction tasks (TE, TR, and ST). 
Response File Format 
In a template file, the objects produced are in the form of records. An example object from a response file is shown 
here: 
<ORGANIZATION-9303020074-1> :=
    ORG_NAME: "Evergreen Information Technologies Inc."
    ORG_ALIAS: "Evergreen Information Technologies"
               "Evergreen"
               "Evergreen Information"
    ORG_LEADER: <PERSON-9303020074-57>
    ORG_TYPE: COMPANY
Each record consists of a header and a list of slots. The header is an identification string for the object, followed by 
the token ":=" on the same line. The header's identification string is enclosed in angle brackets, and consists of three 
pieces of information: 
? Object type 
? Document Number 
? One-up Number 
Each slot in the body of the record consists of a slot name, followed by a colon, and the slot's fills. Set fills and string 
fills may be enclosed in matching single or double quotes. The format of pointer fills is the same as that of the string 
which identifies an object in its header. 
Key File Format 
Here is an example of a record from a human-generated key file: 
<ORGANIZATION-9303020074-1> :=
    ORG_NAME: "Evergreen Information Technologies Inc."
    ORG_TYPE: /COMPANY
    ORG_ALIAS:  "Evergreen Information Technologies"
                "Evergreen"
                "Evergreen Information"
               /"Evergreen"
                "Evergreen Information"
    ORG_LEADER: <PERSON-9303020074-57>
    OBJ_STATUS: OPTIONAL
Key objects differ from response objects in a few respects: 
? a slot may be marked "optional" by placing a slash character ("/") before the very first fill of the object. If the 
response object includes the optional slot, then the response fill and object fill are compared like any other fills. 
If the response object doesn't have the optional slot, no points are scored against it. 
? a slot may contain "alternative" fills, separated by a slash character as the first non-blank character on a line. 
The response fill is matched with whichever of the alternatives gives the best "f"-score for that fill. 
? the entire object may be marked optional, by including the "status" slot, with a fill of "optional". If an optional 
object is aligned with a response object, it is scored like any other object. But if no response object aligns with 
the optional object, no points are scored against the response. 
Template File Caveats 
The information extraction task descriptions often include a BNF which describes the different types of objects in the 
task. The scorer makes some some further assumptions about the format of template files which are not specified in 
the BNF's: 
? all objects from a document should be grouped in one place in the template file. 
? an object's header should be on its own line. 
? if a line has a slot name, the name should be the first non-blank token on the line. 
? there should be only one fill per line. 
? a line containing a fill may have "link information" at the end of the line: 
     SLOT_NAME: "a slot fill"  ##392#404#textsfilename
This is a pair of pound signs ("##") followed by the "start offset" of the fill, then a single pound sign followed 
by the "end offset" of the fill, then another single pound sign, followed by the name of the texts file. None of 
the offset information is used in scoring, but it may be used in later versions of the scorer to highlight portions 
of the texts file. At present the scorer reads the start offset and end offset, but ignores the name of the texts file. 
The texts file name should not contain any pound signs. 
? comments may be inserted into the template files on lines that have a pound sign or a semicolon as the very 
first character on a line. 
SGML Task Files 
The coreference and named entity tasks involve adding Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) to the the 
texts file to create the key and response files. 
The Scoring Software's View of SGML 
SGML is a very flexible and powerful language for adding structure to computer documents. The MUC scoring 
software recognizes a subset of SGML when it scores the coreference and named entity tasks. This discussion is a 
(very) simplified description of SGML. 
An SGML tag is a character string inserted into a text file. Tags usually come in pairs, consisting of an open tag and a 
close tag. A pair of tags enclose a section of the text. For example, here is a piece of text, then the same text with 
some SGML tags added. 
Be glad you don't work 
On the Bungle-bung bridge,
That they're building 
Across Boober Bay at Bum Ridge.
<ADVICE>
Be glad you don't work 
On the <STRUCTURE>Bungle-bung bridge</STRUCTURE>,
That they're building 
Across <BODY TYPE="WATER">Boober Bay</BODY> at <LOC>Bum Ridge</LOC>.
</ADVICE>
Open tags start with an open angle bracket, and are followed immediately by the generic identifier for that type of 
tag. Next come a sequence of attribute definitions for that type of tag. The end of an open tag is the close angle 
bracket. Close tags start with an open angle bracket, then a slash and the same generic identifier as close tag. Close 
tags don't have attributes. 
In the above example, the three tag pairs have generic identifiers ADVICE, STRUCTURE, BODY, and LOC. Only 
the BODY tag has an attribute, named TYPE, with a value of WATER. 
Conversion of SGML tags to MUC objects 
In all MUC tasks, the texts file already has some SGML tags. In the coreference and named entity tasks, the 
annotators and systems add more tags to the texts to create the keys and responses. The scoring software converts the 
tags (together with the text they enclose) into objects which have the same internal structure as the objects for the 
information extraction tasks. 
For example, here's some text marked up with TIMEX tags, which were part of the MUC6 named entity task. 
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE" ALT="fiscal 1994">the first six months of fiscal 1994</TIMEX>
The scorer would convert the text into an object which in a template file would look like this: 
<TIMEX-DOCNUM1-1> :=
    TEXT:  "the first six months of fiscal 1994"
          /"fiscal 1994"
    TYPE:  DATE
SGML task caveats 
In the coreference and named entity tasks, there are some things to be careful of when you are preparing keys or 
responses. One thing is to not delete or insert any characters outside of the SGML tags. Doing this almost always 
confuses the scoring software and lowers the score. To see if you've changed anything you shouldn't have, you can 
use the unix "sed" command, or something similar, as in this example with the coreference tags: 
unix% sed 's/<COREF[^>]*>//g' rsp | sed 's/<\/COREF[^>]*>//g' >rsp.notags
unix% diff texts rsp.notags
The sed command above removes the COREF tags from the responses file (named rsp), and then compares what's left 
to the original texts file (named texts). The diff command will then show what part of the original texts file has 
been changed. 
Output File Formats 
The MUC scoring software prints several reports to show how the key and response compared. There is a score 
report, which only shows "the numbers." There's also report summary, which shows in more detail how the key and 
response objects were aligned. For the coreference task, there is a "partitions" file, which shows how the key and 
response equivalence classes compared. And there is a "map history" file, which gives a detailed, if not very readable, 
description of how the objects were aligned. 
Report Summary Files 
The "report summary" files show how the fills and objects of the keys and responses align. There are three types of 
report summary files: one for the coreference task, one for the named entity task, and one for the information 
extraction tasks. 
Coreference Report Summaries 
Here's a section of a report summary file from the coreference task: 
Document 930620083
COR "Clinton" "Clinton"
COR "Clinton" "Clinton"
COR "the White House" "White House"
COR "The current briefing room" "The current briefing room"
MIS "allies of the securities exchanges" ""
MIS "securities" ""
MIS "Clinton transition officials" ""
MIS "government" ""
MIS "the committee" ""
SPU "" "Kitty Higgins"
SPU "" "an aide"
SPU "" "Michigan"
OPT "the Clinton camp" ""
OPT "the government" ""
OPT "briefing" ""
A coreference report summary shows how the COREF objects were aligned by the scorer. Each line has three fields. 
The first field is a three letter abbreviation telling how a pair of objects are aligned. The abbeviations are: 
COR 
Correct. The key and response objects agree. 
MIS 
Missing. There was a key object but no response object. 
SPU 
Spurious. There was a response object but no key object. 
OPT 
Optional. There was a key object but no response object, but the key object was marked "optional". 
The second field gives the text from the key object (if any), and the third field gives the text from the reponse object. 
Named Entity Report Summaries 
Here's a section of a report summary from the Named Entity task: 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The named entity report summary file gives a one-line-per-object-pair description of how the objects were aligned. 
Each line has seven fields. The first is the generic identifier of the tag which defines the object. The second and third 
contain three-letter abbreviations for how the key and response objects or fills compared. The abbreviations are: 
cor 
Correct. The key and response fills agree. 
inc 
Incorrect. The key and response fills disagree. 
mis 
Missing. There was a key fill but no response fill. 
spu 
Spurious. There was a response fill but no key fill. 
opt 
Optional. There was a key object but no response object, but the key object was marked "optional". The key 
object's fills are also counted as "optional". 
The fourth and fifth fields are the key and response TYPE fills, if there are any. The sixth and seventh fields are the 
key and response TEXT fields. If the key contained more than one TEXT fill (through use of the ALT attribute), the 
one that was aligned with the response fill is the one shown. 
If you are interested in seeing all alternatives, you can specify that you want to use the information-extraction-style 
report summary files. Just include the line 
:use_IE_report_summary  yes
somewhere in the configuration file. 
Information Extraction Report Summaries

The information extraction report summaries files have four columns. The first column shows the result of the pairing 
on that line. Upper case values are for object comparisons, and lower case values are for single fill comparisons. 
Possible values are: 
cor 
Correct. The key and response agree. 
inc 
Incorrect. The key and response disagree. 
mis 
Missing. There was a key but no response. 
spu 
Spurious. There was a response but no key. 
opt 
Optional. There was a key but no response, and the key object or slot was marked optional. 
uns 
Unscored. The object or slot isn't scored. 
rem 
Removed. This is for pointers to optional objects. If a key pointer points to an optional key object that was not 
aligned with any response object, the fill is "removed," and doesn't count toward the score. 
The second column shows the name of the slots for the key and response object for the line (and the lines following if 
there are multiple fills in the slot). 
The third and fourth columns show the key and response object records, respectively. 
Coreference "Partition" Files 
For the coreference task, there is an extra report generated, which shows the COREF objects' equivalence classes, and 
how they are partitioned by the comparison between keys and responses. Key equivalence classes are surrounded by 
star characters (*****), and response equivalence classes by equal signs (=====). 
Here is a portion of a partition file that gives one key equivalence class from a MUC 6 document. 
****************************************************
C 88 116 1 NULL 108 "Washington, an Exchange Ally,"
C 581 609 4 0 39 "Ms. Washington, 44 years old,"

C 1257 1259 22 20 49 "She"
M 376 454 0 1 "Consuela Washington, an expert in securities laws,"
****************************************************
Each line containing COREF objects begins with a "C" or an "M", for "correct" or "missing." Correct objects' lines 
have, in order from left to right, 
? the start offset of the noun phrase in the texts file. 
? the end offset of the noun phrase in the texts file. 
? the ID of the key COREF object. 
? the ID of the key COREF object to which this object points (or "NULL" if the object has no REF attribute). 
? the ID of the response COREF object aligned with the key coref object. 
? the noun phrase that was marked up to create the object. 
In the "missing" objects' lines, the fields are the same except the response object's ID is, of course, missing. Note that 
there are blank lines between some of the COREF object lines. These show the partitions of the key equivalence class 
by the response. While the key ties together every noun phrase between the stars, the response doesn't, so there are 
"breaks" in the equivalence class. These breaks are what are counted to get the recall error. The precision error is got 
from the response equivalence classes in a symmetric manner. 
Map History Files 
The "map history" output file is meant primarily for other computer programs to read. It consists of one large Tcl-
style list. Each element of this list is itself a list which corresponds to one "document" from the keys and/or responses 
file. The document lists also contain lists, and this nesting of lists continues on down to the single fill level. Lists in 
the hierarchy consist of attribute name/attribute value pairs. Attribute names start with a hyphen. 
The Hierarchy of Map History Lists 
In hierarchy order, the attributes are: 
Document level

Description of Map History Attributes 
Attribute values are strings, lists, integers, or nonexistent if the attribute's presence alone implies something. At 
present, the attributes are: 
class_name 
the name of a object type, e.g. "ENAMEX". 
class_pairs 
a list describing how the groups of objects of the same type were aligned. 
class_tallies 
single-fill tallies for all objects of one type in one document. 
clean_fill 
How a single string fill looks when it is compared to another fill. Leading and trailing whitespace has been 
trimmed, certain substrings have been removed, and all intertoken whitespaces are changed to single space 
characters. For example, the string "a corporation that manages the Seaport" would be changed to "that 
manages the seaport" (depending on how the scorer is configured), because the premodifier "a" and the 
corporate designator "corporation" are both removed, and all characters are made lowercase. 
docnum 
the string identifying the document in the texts file 
doctallies 
the totals of the (in order) possible, actual, correct, partial, incorrect, missing, spurious, and noncommittal 
single-fill "tallies" for the entire document. 
doc_section 
in the SGML tasks (named entity and coreference), the name SGML tags which enclose the object in the texts 
document, e.g. "HEADLINE" or "TEXT". 
fill 
the fill as it appeared in the key or response file (with one exception: in the coreference task's REF fill, this is 
how the REF attribute would look if it were written as a template object pointer). 
key_obj_id 
The identification string of the key object of the pair. 
key_obj_optional 
Whether the object in the key is marked optional. This attribute has no value following it in the list; its presence 
alone means the key was marked optional. 
key_obj_rep_id 
Almost always the same as the key_obj_id. In the scenario template task of past MUC's, there have been 
objects in the key that are "identical". All objects are put in equivalence classes (different from the equivalence 
classes of the coreference task), so that pointers to any object in an equivalence class are still counted correct, 
even though they don't point to exactly the same object. 
key_obj_end_offset 
in the SGML tasks (named entity and coreference), the position in the texts file, measured from the beginning 
of the file, where the close tag for the object is. 
key_obj_start_offset 
in the SGML tasks (named entity and coreference), the position in the texts file, measured from the beginning 
of the file, where the open tag for the object is. 
key_single_fill 
a list describing the single fill from the key. 
key_slot_optional 
whether the slot was marked optional in the key. This attribute has no value associated with it. If the attribute 
name is there, it means the slot was marked optional. 
multi_fill_pairs 
the list describing how the key slot fill alternatives were aligned with the response alternatives. (When scoring 
system responses, there should be only one response alternative. For interannotator comparisons, both key and 
response may have many alternatives.) 
multi_fill_tallies 
the tallies for the single fills in this pairing of alternatives (see multi_fill_pairs). 
obj_pair_status 
How the objects of a pair compared at the object-level; correct, incorrect, etc. 
obj_pair_tallies 
the tallies for the single fills in this pair of objects. 
obj_pairs 
a list describing how objects of one type were aligned. 
rsp_obj_id 
The identification string of the rsp object of the pair. 
rsp_obj_optional 
Whether the object in the response is marked optional. 
rsp_obj_rep_id 
Almost always the same as the rsp_obj_id. In the scenario template task of past MUC's, there have been objects 
in response that are identical. All objects are put in equivalence classes (different from the equivalence classes 
of the coreference task), so that pointers to any object in an equivalence class are still counted correct, even 
though they don't point to exactly the same object. 
rsp_single_fill 
a list describing the single fill from the response. 
single_fill_pair_status 
A three-character abbreviation for how the two single fills in a pair compared. 
single_fill_pair_tallies 
Another way for writing the single_fill_pair_status, that is compatible with all other tallies up the hierarchy. 
single_fill_pairs 
the list describing how one list of key single fills (possibly from many alternatives) was aligned with one list of 
response single fills. 
slot_name 
the name of the slots which are paired here. 
slot_pairs 
the list describing how the two objects' slots compared. 
slot_tallies 
the tallies for the single fills in this slot's comparison. 
type 
the type of the single fill (set fill, string fill, or pointer fill). 
Score Files 
Information Extraction Score Report 
Figure shows one page from a scores file for the MUC-6 scenario template task. There is one page of scores for each 
document in the task, plus one page for the totals over all documents. Each page is divided into four sections. The 
first section shows the "text filtering" or "relevance" scores. These have to do with judging whether each document is 
even relevant to the scenario the NLP system should be looking for. The second section gives the object scores, which 
shows how the keys and response agree at the object level. The third section shows how well the keys and responses 
agree at the slot fill level. Only the slot scores determine the final scores, which are the last thing on a page. 
The template element and template relation score reports are identical to the scenario template score reports, except 
that they have no text filtering section.

The report has several parts: 
subtask scores 
Each named entity tag contains an attribute categorizing the marked-up text. This section shows how well the 
response did for each category. 
section scores 
Each document is already marked up with SGML even before the keys and responses are made. This section 
summarizes how the response did for each "section" of the SGML document. 
object scores 
Tallies at the object level. These tallies don't contribute to the final score at the bottom of the page. 
slot scores 
Tallies at the slot level. It is the slot level tallies which are used to determine the final score.

There is one line for each document in the corpus. From left to right, the fields of each line are: 
1. the document number of the line's article. 
2. The number equivalence classes of COREF objects in the key and response, respectively. 
3. The recall score, as a fraction and as a percent. 
4. The precision score, as a fraction and as a percent. 
5. the f-score, if you give recall and precision equal weight. 
Configuration File Formats 
The scoring software has three configuration files, that you use to specify how the keys and responses are compared. 
The reason there are three files is partly historical and partly because parsing some of the configuration options 
differs a little. In future versions the three files will probably coalesce into one file. 
Main Configuration File Format 
You must specify the name of the main configuration file on the command line when you invoke the scorer. The 
configuration file tells the scorer how to compare the keys and responses. It consists of a list of options. Each option 
is specified by a colon (":") as the first character of a line, followed immediately (no spaces) by the name of the 
option. After some more spaces come the value or values of the option. Values are separated by spaces. Values which 
themselves contain spaces must be enclosed in single or double quotes. The current options are: 
class_defs 
The strings which declare the scorer objects' types and give their score report names and mapping order. This is 
a required entry in the configuration file. Each class_def string is a quadruple of tokens: 
1. the name of the class 
2. the name of the class that you want to appear in the score report 
3. either "scored" or "unscored," depending on whether you want the object-level scoring to count this class 
of object.Note that this value doesn't affect whether the fills within the objects are scored. Slot-level 
scoring is specified in the slot_defs option, described below. 
4. the map threshold. The f-score for each slot of an object is calculated and multiplied by that slot's map 
weight. The weighted f-scores are them summed, and if they exceed the object's map threshold, then the 
response and key objects are deemed similar enough to be aligned. For the past couple of MUC's, the 
threshold has been set to 0 and the map weights have be made really big, so that if the two objects agree 
in just one fill of one slot, they may be aligned. 
Here is an example of the class_def option, for the named entity task: 
:class_defs
       "enamex enamex scored 0"
       "numex numex scored 0"
       "timex timex scored 0"
       
The class def strings should be in the order that you want the classes of objects aligned. For the named entity, 
template element and coreference tasks, this order is unimportant. But for the template relation and scenario 
template tasks, the pointer fills are judged correct or incorrect based on whether or not the objects they point to 
are aligned. So the aligning should always start with objects that contain no pointer fills, and proceed to objects 
whose only pointer fills reference objects without pointer fills, etc. (See the section on how the TR and ST tasks 
are scored, below.) 
content_name 
In the scenario template task, the name of the slot in the "template" object (see the template_name option 
below) which must have fills if the document is relevant to the ST task, and which must not have fills if the 
document is not relevant to the ST task. Default: "content". 
corporate_designators 
A list of substrings which will be removed from string fills before they are compared. As the name implies, it's 
usually a list of strings like "corporation", "ltd", etc. Note that if you want to remove substrings that themselves 
have postmodifiers (see below), you must specify the substrings with postmodifiers changed to spaces, and all 
resulting spaces in the corporate designator string squashed into one. For instance, if you don't want the string 
"S.A. DE C.V." to affect stringfill comparisons, it should go into the configuration file as "S A DE C V", with 
one space between the "A" and the "DE". (But for the coreference task, you should not take out the 
postmodifiers.) Default: the empty list. 
doc_section_groups 
Used in the Named Entity task, to group doc_section (see below) scores. In MET 2, the documents in the texts 
file have various SGML formats. For example, in some documents there is a HEADLINE tag, but in other 
documents, the tag is called HL. To get a score for all document sections which are the same semantically, but 
differ in their tags, you can "group" the similar tags, by putting, for example, "Headline HEADLINE HL" as 
one value for this option. The first token in a value string is what you want to call the group. The rest of the 
tokens are the name of doc sections. You must also specify the rest of the tokens in the "doc_sections" option 
described below. If this option is not in the configuration file, the doc_sections scores are used. If it's specified, 
the scorer only gives the tallies for the names given. Default: None; uses doc_sections instead. 
doc_sections 
The names of the SGML sections that should be parsed for coreference or named entity objects, and which will 
be used to report "document section scores" in the named entity task. The default is this list of sections: 
<DOC>, <DATELINE>, <DD>, <HEADLINE>, and <TEXT>. Note that as long as the documents are 
enclosed by <DOC>, all of the objects will be parsed by default. Having tags that don't really occur in the 
documents won't hurt anything. If one section is nested in another section, it is the innermost section which will 
be reported for the score. For example, if there are HEADLINE's inside the TEXT, the objects will be 
considered to be inside the HEADLINE. 
dump_map_history 
Whether or not to print the map history report. Default: "no". If anything else, the map history will be printed. 
equatable_objects 
In the scenario template task, which objects may possibly be identical. In MUC 6, the "IN_AND_OUT" objects 
were like this. Default: no objects. 
key_file 
The name of the keys file. Default: "keys". 
map_history_file 
The name of the map history output file. Default: "map_history" 
muc_base_directory 
A string that is prepended to the names of all filename options. This allows you to give the absolute pathname 
of all filenames without a lot of typing. Defaults to the empty string. 
ne_subtask_names 
A list of strings, each with three tokens. The first token is the object type. The second token is the slot name. 
The third token is the fill value. The tallies for all fills of that value in that slot in that type of object will be 
reported in the NE subtask section of the score report. Default: the following strings: 
? "enamex type organization" 
? "enamex type person" 
? "enamex type location" 
? "enamex type other" 
? "timex type date" 
? "timex type time" 
? "timex type other" 
? "numex type money" 
? "numex type percent" 
? "numex type other" 
optional_status_slot 
The name of the slot in all objects that you use to specify that an objects is optional, by putting the string 
"OPTIONAL" or "OPT" as the slot's only fill. 
partition_file 
The name of the partition output file for the coreference task. 
postmodifiers 
A list of strings that are changed to spaces in stringfills before the stringfills are compared. Usually used so that 
punctuation marks don't affect the comparisons. Default: the empty list. 
premodifiers 
A list of tokens that are removed from the beginning of stringfills before they are compared. Usually used so 
that the words "a," "an," and "the" don't affect the scoring. 
report_field_separator 
A character string that is printed between the fields of the information extraction-style "report summary" files. 
The default is the vertical bar ("|"). 
report_summary_file 
The name of the report summary file. Default: "report_summary". 
response_file 
The name of the responses file. Default: "responses". 
score_report_file 
The name of the scores file. Default: "scores". 
scoring_method 
One of either "key2response" or "key2key". "Key2response" is the default. Key2key is used for interannotator 
comparisons. 
scoring_task 
One of "coreference", "named_entity", "template_element", "template_relation", and "scenario_template." 
There is no default for this option. It must specified. 
sgml_ALT_slot 
In the named entity task, the name of the slot whose contents will be moved into the TEXT slot (see 
sgml_TEXT_slot below), as an alternative to the contents got from the text between the SGML tags. 
sgml_DOCNUM_gid 
The name of the SGML tag which identifies the section which holds the document numbers. Default: DOCNO. 
Note that every document in the keys or responses file must have this section. The document number is simply 
every digit [0-9] in the specified document section. 
sgml_DOC_gid 
The name of the SGML tags which enclose one entire document. Default: "DOC". 
sgml_ID_slot 
In the coreference task, the name of the attribute of the tags for the task which give the unique identification 
string for the object. Default: "ID". 
sgml_MIN_slot 
In the coreference task, the name of the attribute which holds the "head" of the noun phrases enclosed in the 
coreference tags. Default: "MIN". 
sgml_REF_slot 
In the coreference task, the name of the attribute which holds the pointer some other "identical" object in the 
document. Default: "REF". 
sgml_TEXT_slot 
In the named entity and coreference tasks, the name of the slot into which the text between the open and close 
tags goes. Default: "TEXT". 
sgml_TYPE_slot 
In the named entity task, the name of the slot for the categorization subtask. Default: "TYPE". 
sgml_alternative_separator 
In the named entity and coreference tasks, the character which separates alternatives within attribute values. 
Note that for the current tasks, this is only relevant for the keys. Default: the vertical bar character, ("|"). 
sgml_attribute_quote_char 
In the named entity and coreference tasks, if a tag's attribute value is a string which contains a double quote, the 
scorer's parser will become confused. This option contains the character which has been substituted for the 
double quote in the keys or responses file. (Again, in the current tasks, this will only affect how the keys are 
prepared, since the response don't have attributes that might contain quotes.) Default: the "star" character ("*"). 
slot_defs 
The list of slot definitions. This is a required entry in the configuration file. Each slot definition consists of six 
tokens: 
1. The name of the class of object to which the slot belongs. 
2. The name of the slot. 
3. The name of the slot that you want printed in the score report file. 
4. Either "scored" or "unscored," depending on whether you want the fills of this slot to be scored. 
5. The map weight. See the entry for the class_def option for an explanation of this number. 
6. The slot type; either "set", "string", or "pointer" (you may put anything here for a pointer slot. The scorer 
only looks to see that it isn't "set" or "string"). 
Here's an example of the slot_defs option for the named entity class: 
:slot_defs
  "enamex text text scored 4 string"
  "enamex type type scored 4 set"
  "enamex status status unscored 4 set"
  "enamex alt alt unscored 4 string"
  "timex text text scored 4 string"
  "timex type type scored 4 set"
  "timex status status unscored 4 set"
  "timex alt alt unscored 4 string"
  "numex text text scored 4 string"
  "numex type type scored 4 set "
  "numex status status unscored 4 set"
  "numex alt alt unscored 4 string"
  
stringfill_correct_comparison 
one of "ORIG", "STRAIGHTENED", or "CLEAN". Which part of a pair of stringfills is compared to see if 
they match. If ORIG, the original stringfills are compared. If STRAIGHTENED, some massaging is 
performed: Whitespaces are trimmed before and after the fills, and all whitespaces between the tokens are 
turned into single spaces. If CLEAN, the premodifiers, postmodifiers, and corporate designators strings (see the 
option descriptions for these last three) are removed from the string. Default: CLEAN 
stringfill_partial_comparison 
If the stringfills don't match correctly, the comparison used to see if partial credit is given for the match. See 
stringfill_correct_comparison for the possible values. In additions to the three values listed there, you may 
specifiy NONE (the default) if you want no partial credit given. 
template_name 
The name of the "template" object used in the scenario template object. This object has a "content" slot (see the 
"content_name" option) whose filling or leaving empty determines whether document is relevant to the 
scenario. For scoring the text-filtering part of the task, only one one template object per document will be 
checked for content. Default "TEMPLATE". 
use_IE_report_summary 
Defaults to "no". If anything else, the one-line-per-object report summaries used for the named entity and 
coreference tasks will be replaced with the template-object-record-style report summaries used in the 
Information Extraction tasks. (This option doesn't affect the TE, TR, or ST tasks). 
Calculation of Scores 
Template Element (TE) Scoring 
The methods for scoring the Template Element, Template Relation, Scenario Template, and Named Entity tasks are 
very similar. From the standpoint of calculating scores, The template element (TE) task is the basic task of these four. 
This section will explain how TE is scored, and subsequent sections will tell how the NE, TR, and ST tasks can be 
seen as extensions to TE scoring. 
Simply put, the final score for the four tasks is found by aligning the key objects with the response objects and then 
comparing the objects' single fills. Structures are aligned at each level of the object/slot/multi-fill/single-fill structure 
hierarchy. However, it is the single-fill alignments that we count to get the score. 
The result of aligning one key single fill to one response single fill (or of leaving one key or response single fill 
unaligned) is called a tally. There are six kinds of tallies: 
COR Correct 
the two single fills are considered identical. 
INC Incorrect 
the two single fills are not identical. 
PAR Partially Correct 
the two single fills are not identical, but partial credit should still be given. 
MIS Missing 
a key object has no response object aligned with it. 
SPU Spurious 
a response object has no key object aligned with it. 
NON Noncommittal 
the alignment doesn't contribute anything to the scoring. 
Given a set of tallies, there are several values calculated in the alignment and final scoring. 
POS Possible 
The number of fills in the key which contribute to the final score. 
POS = COR + INC + PAR + MIS
       
ACT Actual 
The number of fills in the response. 
ACT = COR + INC + PAR + SPU
       
REC Recall 
a measure of how much of the key fills were produced in the response. 
      COR + (0.5 * PAR)
REC = -----------------
            POS
       
PRE Precision 
a measure of how much of the response fills are actually in the key. 
      COR + (0.5 * PAR)
PRE = -----------------
           ACT
       
Intuitively, information extraction systems often sacrifice precision for recall, or vice versa. If a system is tuned to 
"catch everything" (good recall), it often catches more than it should (bad precision). And if it tries to be conservative 
(good precision), it tends to miss some information (bad recall). When evaluating responses, then, one has to be 
careful about comparing one response from a system tuned for high recall to another response from a system tuned 
for high precision. van Rijsbergen's F-measure is used to combine recall and precision measures into one measure. 
The formula for F is 
                    2
             ((beta)  +  1.0) * P * R
         F = ------------------------
                     2
              ((beta)  * P) + R
where beta is the relative weight of precision and recall. 
The following measures are also calculated from the tallies, and are in the score report: 
UND Undergeneration 
      MIS
UND = ---
      POS
       
OVG Overgeneration 
      SPU
OVG = ---
      ACT
       
SUB Substitution 
       INC + (0.5 * PAR)
SUB = -------------------
        COR + INC + PAR
       
ERR Error per response fill 
       INC + (0.5 * PAR) + SPU + MIS
ERR = -------------------------------
        COR + INC + PAR + SPU + MIS
       
When aligning two multi-fills, the scoring software pairs all single-fills of the multi-fills. For example, if the key 
multi-fill has three single-fills, and the response multi-fill has two multi-fills, then the scorer creates six pairs of 
single-fills. Each single-fill pair has an F-score associated with it. The scorer sorts these single-fill pairs by F-score in 
decreasing order. It then proceeds down the sorted list, picking out pairs of single-fills for which neither single-fill 
has been chosen yet, and adding them to the final alignment for that pair of multi-fills. Any key or response single 
fills left over (in our example, there would be a key single fill left) is tallied as missing or spurious. 
A key slot is aligned with a response slot when the two slots have the same name. The lone multi-fill in the response 
slot is aligned with the multi-fill in the key slot that results in the best multi-fill-to-multi-fill F-score. Any leftover 
multi-fills in the key slot are unscored, and are tallied as "noncommittal". 
Key objects are aligned with response objects of the same object "type" or "class" To choose which objects are 
paired, the scorer first generates all possible pairs of objects in the class. The F-score for each pair of objects is 
calculated from the way the objects' single-fills align. The weighted F-score is also calculated, by multiplying each 
slot-pair's F-score by the mapping weight of that slot, and summing the factors. The object pairs are sorted by 
(unweighted) F-score in decreasing order. Then the scorer proceeds down the sorted list, picking out pairs of objects 
for which neither single-fill has been chosen yet, and for which the weighted F-score exceeds the threshold for that 
type of object. 
If any objects are left over after this, the scorer looks for any key objects which are marked "optional". The single fills 
of these objects are tallied as non-committal. If any key objects are left after this, their single-fills are tallied as 
missing. The single fills of any leftover response objects are tallied as spurious. 
When all classes of objects have been aligned, the tallies are summed, and the resulting measures are calculated. 
Template Relation (TR) and Scenario Template (ST) Scoring 
For the TR and ST tasks, the scoring proceeds just as in TE scoring, but the order of alignment of objects is 
important. It is helpful to look at the classes of objects in a TR or ST task as vertices of a topological graph. If one 
type of object has a slot containing pointers to another type of object, then the graph has a directed edge from the first 
class to the pointed-to class: 
When comparing a key pointer fill to a response pointer fill, the only way the scorer can compare the pointers is by 
looking to see if the objects to which they point have already been aligned by the scorer. If they have, and if the 
object pointed to by the key pointer is aligned to the object pointed to by the response pointer, then the pointers are 
tallied as correct. 
Since pointer correctness is defined in this way, the directed graph cannot have any directed cycles in it. Further, the 
scorer has to align the objects so that any pointed-to objects must already have been aligned. So in the above figure, 
the order of mapping could be D-B-C-A or D-C-B-A. Any other order would confuse the scorer. 
The only other difference between the TR and ST task and the TE task is the existence of implicitly optional objects 
in the key. In TR, a "relation" object that points to an optional "template element" object is optional, whether it's 
marked optional or not. And in ST, an object is implicitly optional if the only pointers pointing to that object are in 
optional slots or in one one multi-fill of a slot, but not in another multi-fill of the same slot (ie, there is an alternative 
multi-fill in the slot that doesn't point to the object). 
Named Entity (NE) Task Scoring 
The Named Entity task is scored like the Template Element task, except that the objects which are aligned must come 
from SGML elements in the same position of the original text file. For instance, if in the key the name "Bill Clinton" 
is tagged in the first paragraph of an article, and in the response "Bill Clinton" is tagged in the tenth paragraph, the 
objects will not be aligned, even if they would give an F-score of 100%. 
Coreference (CO) Task Scoring 
The scoring of the Coreference task is very different from that of the other four tasks. Rather than counting single 
fills, the CO algorithm compares equivalence classes of objects in the key with equivalence classes of objects in the 
the response. For a detailed explanation, see A Model-Theoretic Coreference Scoring Scheme, by Mark Vilain, John 
Burger, John Aberdeen, Dennis Connolly, and Lynette Hirschman in the MUC-6 Proceedings.
