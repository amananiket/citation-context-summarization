Abstract 
This paper describes material for a 
course in computational linguistics 
which concentrates on building (parts 
of) realistic language technology ap- 
plications for Dutch. We present an 
overview of the reasons for develop- 
ing new material, rather than using 
existing text-books. Next we present 
an overview of the course in the form 
of six exercises, covering advanced 
use of finite state methods, grammar 
development, and natural language 
interfaces. The exercises emphasise the 
benefits of special-purpose development 
tools, the importance of testing on 
realistic data-sets, and the possibilities 
for web-applications based on natural 
language processing. 
1 In t roduct ion  
This paper describes a set of exercises in compu- 
tational linguistics. The material was primarily 
developed for two courses: an general introduc- 
tion to computational linguistics, and a more ad- 
vanced course focusing on natural anguage inter- 
faces. Students who enter the first course have 
a background in either humanities computing or 
cognitive science. This implies that they possess 
some general programming skills and that they 
have at least some knowledge of general inguis- 
tics. Furthermore, all students entering the course 
are familiar with logic programming and Prolog. 
The native language of practically all students is 
Dutch. 
The aim of the introductory course is to provide 
a overview of language technology applications, of 
the concepts and techniques used to develop such 
applications, and to let students gain practical ex- 
perience in developing (components) of these ap- 
plications. The second course focuses on compu- 
tational semantics and the construction of natu- 
ral language interfaces using computational gram- 
mars. 
Course material for computational linguistics 
exists primarily in the form of text books, such 
as Allen (1987), Gazdar and Mellish (1989) and 
Covington (1994). They focus primarily on ba- 
sic concepts and techniques (finite state automata, 
definite clause grammar, parsing algorithms, con- 
struction of semantic representations, etc.) and 
the implementation f toy systems for experiment- 
ing with these techniques. If course-ware is pro- 
vided, it consists of the code and grammar frag- 
ments discussed in the text-material. The lan- 
guage used for illustration is primarily English. 
While attention for basic concepts and tech- 
niques is indispensable for any course in this 
field, one may wonder whether implementation 
issues need to be so prominent as they are in 
the text-books of, say, Gazdar and Mellish (1989) 
and Covington (1994). Developing natural lan- 
guage applications from scratch may lead to max- 
imal control and understanding, but is also time- 
consuming, requires good programming skills 
rather than insight in natural language phenom- 
ena, and, in tutorial settings, is restricted to toy- 
systems. These are disadvantages for an intro- 
ductory course in particular. In such a course, an 
attractive alternative is to skip most of the imple- 
mentation issues, and focus instead on what can 
be achieved if one has the right tools and data 
available. The advantage is that the emphasis will 
shift naturally to a situation where students must 
concentrate primarily on developing accounts for 
linguistic data, on exploring data available in the 
form of corpora or word-lists, and on using real 
high-level tools. Consequently, it becomes fea- 
sible to consider not only toy-systems and toy- 
fragments, but to develop more or less realistic 
components of natural anguage applications. As 
the target language of the course is Dutch, this 
also implies that at least some attention has to 
be paid to specific properties of Dutch grammar, 
and to (electronic) linguistic resources for Dutch. 
Since students nowadays have access to powerful 
hardware and both tools and data can be dis- 
tributed easily over the internet, there are no real 
practical obstacles. 
Text-books which are concerned primarily with 
computational semantics and natural anguage in- 
terfaces, such as Pereira and Shieber (1987) and 
Blackburn and Bos (1998), tend to introduce a 
toy-domain, such as a geography database or an 
excerpt of a movie-script, as application area. In 
trying to develop exercises which are closer to real 
applications, we have explored the possibilities of 
using web-accessible databases as back-end for a 
natural anguage interface program. 
More in particular, we hope to achieve the fol- 
lowing: 
? Students learn to use high-level tools. The 
development of a component for morphologi- 
cal analysis requires far more than what can 
be achieved by specifying and implementing 
the underlying finite state automata directly. 
Rather, abstract descriptions of morpholog- 
ical rules should be possible, and software 
should be provided to support development 
and debugging. Similarly, while a program- 
ming language such as Prolog offers possi- 
bilities for relatively high-level descriptions 
of natural language grammars, the advan- 
t, ages of specialised languages for implement- 
ing unification-based grammars and accom- 
panying tools are obvious. Furthermore, the 
availability of graphical interfaces and visual- 
isation in tutorial situations is a bonus which 
should not be underestimated. 
? Students learn to work with real data. In 
developing practical, robust, wide-coverage, 
language technology applications, researchers 
have found that the use of corpora and elec- 
tronic dictionaries is absolutely indispens- 
able. Students should gain at least some 
familiarity with such sources, learn how to 
search large datasets, and how to deal with 
exceptions, errors, or unclear cases in real 
data. 
? Students become familiar with quantitative 
evaluation methods. One advantage of de- 
veloping components using real data is that 
one can use the evaluation metrics domi- 
nant in most current computational linguis- 
tics research. That is, an implementation of
hyphenatiOn-rule or a grammar for temporal 
expressions can be tested by measuring its ac- 
curacy on a list of unseen words or utterances. 
This provides insight in the difficulty of solv- 
ing similar problems in a robust fashion for 
unrestricted text. 
Students develop language technology compo- 
nents for Dutch. In teaching computational 
linguistics to students whose native language 
is not English, it is common practice to fb- 
cus primarily on the question how the (En- 
glish) examples in the text book can be car- 
ried over to a grammar for one's own lan- 
guage. As this may take considerable time 
and effort, more advanced topics are usually 
skipped. In a course which aims primarily at 
Dutch, and which also contains material de- 
scribing some of the peculiarities of this lan- 
guage (hyphenation rules, spelling rules rele- 
vant to morphology, word order in main and 
subordinate clauses, verb clusters), there is 
room for developing more elaborate and ex- 
tended components. 
Students develop realistic applications. The 
use of tools and real data makes it easier 
to develop components which are robust and 
which have relatively good coverage. Appli- 
cations in the area of computational seman- 
tics can be made more interesting by exploit- 
ing the possibilities offered by the internet. 
The growing amount of information available 
on the internet provides opportunities for ac- 
cessing much larger databases (such as public 
transport ime-tables or library catalogues), 
and therefore, for developing more realistic 
applications. 
The sections below are primarily concerned with a 
number of exercises we have developed to achieve 
the goals mentioned above. A accompanying text 
is under development. 1 
2 F in i te  State  Methods  
A typical course in computational linguistics 
starts with finite state methods. Finite state tech- 
niques can provide computationally efficient solu- 
tions to a wide range of tasks in natural anguage 
processing. Therefore, students hould be familiar 
with the basic concepts of automata (states and 
transitions, recognizers and transducers, proper- 
ties of automata) and should know how to solve 
t See www. let. rug. nl/~gosse/tt for a preliminary 
version of the text and links to the exercises described 
here.

toy natural language processing problems using 
automata .  
However, when solving 'real' problems most re- 
searchers use software supporting high-level de- 
scriptions of automata, automatic compilation 
and optimisation, and debugging facilities, pack- 
ages for two-level morphology, such as PC-KIMMO 
(Antworth, 1990), are well-known examples. As 
demonstrated in Karttunen etal .  (1997), an even 
more flexible use of finite state technology can be 
obtained by using a calculus of regular expres- 
sions. A high-level description language suited for 
language ngineering purposes can be obtained by 
providing, next to the standard regular expression 
operators, a range of operators intended to facili- 
tate the translation of linguistic analyses into reg- 
ular expressions. Complex problems can be solved 
by composing automata defined by simple regular 
expressions. 
We have developed a number of exercises in 
which regular expression calculus is used to solve 
more or less 'realistic' problems in language tech- 
nology. Students use the FSA-utilities package 2 
(van Noord, 1997), which provides a powerful an- 
guage for regular expressions and possibilities for 
adding user-defined operators and macros, compi- 
lation into (optimised) automata, and a graphical 
user-interface. Automata can be displayed graph- 
ically, which makes it easy to learn the meaning 
of various regular expression operators (see figure 
1). 
Exercise I: Dutch Syllable Structure 
Hyphenation for Dutch (Vosse, 1994) requires that 
complex words are split into morphemes, and mor-

\[e,{\[e,u ^\] ,i,o,u}-\] }). 
macro(coda, {\[b, {s,t}^\], \[d,s^,t-\]}). 
Figure 2: First approximation of a regular expres- 
sion defining Dutch syllables, t ^  means that t is

phemes are split into syllables. Each morpheme 
or syllable boundary is a potential insertion spot 
for a hyphen. Whereas one would normally de- 
fine the notion "syllable' in terms of phonemes, it
should be defined in terms of character strings for 
this particular iask. The syllable can easily be 
defined in terms of a regular expression. For in- 
stance, using the regular expression syntax of FSA, 
a first approximation is given in figure 2. The 
definition in 2 allows such syllables as \[b, a ,d \ ] ,  
\[b,1 ,a,d\]  , \ [b~r ,e ,e  ,d ,s , t \ ] ,  etc. 
Students can provide a definition of the Dutch 
syllable covering all perceived cases in about 
twenty lines of code. The quality of the solu- 
tions could be tested in two ways. First, stu- 
dents could test which words of a list of over 
5000 words of ~he form \[C*,V+,C*\] (where C and 
V are macros for consonants and vowels, respec- 
tively) are accepted and rejected by the syllable 
regular expression. A restrictive definition will re- 
ject words which are bisyllabic (ge i jk t )  and for- 
eign words such as crash, s f inx,  and jazz.  Sec- 
ond, students could test how accurate the defi- 
nition is in predicting possible hyphenation posi- 
tions in a list of morphophonemic words. To this 
end, a list of 12000 morphophonemic words and 
their hyphenation properties was extracted from 
the CELEX lexical database (Baayen et al, 1993). 3
Tile best solutions for this task resulted in a 5% 
error rate (i.e. percentage of words in which a 
wrongly placed hyphenation point occurs). 
Exercise I h  Verbal  Inflection 
A second exercise concentrated on finite state 
transducers. Regular expressions had to be con- 
aThe hyphenation task itself was defined as a finite 
state transducer: 
macro(hyph,  rep lace( \ [ \ ]  : - , sy l l ,  sy l l ) )  
The operator replace (Target, LeftContext, 
RightContext) implements 'leftmost' ( and 'longest 
match') replacement (Karttunen, 1995). This ensures 
that in the cases where a consonant could be either 
final in a coda or initial in tile next onset, it is in fact 
added to the onset.

Figure 3: Dutch verbal inflection 
structed for computing the surface form of ab- 
stract verbal stem forms and combinations of a 
stem and a verbal inflection suffix (see figure 3). 
Several spelling rules need to be captured. Ex- 
amples (b) and (c) show that single consonants 
following a short vowel are doubled when followed 
by the '+en'  suffix, while long vowels (normally 
represented by two identical characters) are writ- 
ten as a single character when followed by a single 
consonant and ' +en' Examples (d-g) illustrate 
that the rule which requires doubling of a conso- 
nant after a short vowel is not applied if the pre- 
ceding vowel is a schwa. Note that a single ' e '  
(sometimes ' i ' )  can be either a stressed vowel or 
a schwa. This makes the rule hard to apply on the 
basis of the written form of a word. Examples (h- 
j) illustrate the effect of devoicing on spelling. Ex- 
amples (i-l) illustrate several other irregularities in
present ense and infinitive forms that need to be 
captured. Examples (n-q), finally, illustrate past 
tense formation of weak verbal stems. Past tenses 
are formed with either a '+te '  or '+de' ending 
(' +ten ' / '  +den' for plural past tenses). The form 
of the past tense is predictable on the basis of the 
preceding stem, and this a single underlying suffix 
'+Te' is used. Stems ending with one of the con- 
sonants ' c , f ,h ,k ,p ,s , t '  and 'x '  form a past 
tense with '+te ' ,  while all other stems receive a 
'+de' ending. Note that the spelling rule for de- 
voicing applies to past tenses as well (p-q). In 
the exercise, only past tenses of weak stems were 
considered. 
The implementation of spelling rules as trans- 
ducers is based on the replace-operator (Kart- 
macro(verbal_ inf lect ion,

can be implemented in FSA as:

An  example  illustrating the rule format for trans- 
ducers is given in figure 4. Most  solutions to the 
exercise consisted of a collection of approximately 
30 replace-rules wh ich  were composed to form 
a single finite state transducer. The  size of this 
transducer varied between 4.000 and  over 16.000 
states, indicating that the complexity of the task 
is well beyond reach of text-book approaches. 
For testing and  evaluation, a list of almost 
50.000 pairs of underlying and  surface forms was  
extracted f rom Celex. 4 i0 % of the data was  given 
to the students as training material. A lmost  all so- 
lutions achieved a high level of accuracy, even for 
the 'verwennen/ tekenen '  cases, wh ich  can only 
be dealt with using heuristics. The  best solutions 
}lad less than 0 ,5% error-rate when tested on the 
unseen data. 
4 Reliable extraction of this information from Celex 
turned out to be non-trivial. Inflected forms are given 
in the database, and linked to their (abstract) stem by 
means  of an index. However, the distinction between 
weak and strong past tenses is not marked explicitly in 
the database and thus we had to use the heuristic that 
weak past tense singular forms always end in 'te' or 
'de', while strong past tense forms do not. Another 
problem is the fact that different spellings of a word 
are linked to the same index. Thus, 'scalperen' (to 
scalp) is linked to the stem 'skalpeer'. For the pur- 
poses of this exercise, such variation was largely elim- 
inated by several ad-hoe filters. 
3 Grammar Development 
Natural language applications which perform syn- 
tactic analysis can be based on crude methods, 
such as key-word spotting and pattern match- 
ing, more advanced but computationally effi- 
cient methods, such as finite-state syntactic anal- 
ysis, or linguistically motivated methods, such 
as unification-based grammars. At the low-end 
of the scale are systems which perform partial 
syntactic analysis of unrestricted text (chunk- 
ing), for instance for recognition of names or 
temporal expressions, or NP-constituents in gen- 
eral. At the high-end of the scale are wide- 
coverage (unification-based) grammars which per- 
form full syntactic analysis, sometimes for unre- 
stricted text. In the exercises below, students de- 
velop a simple grammar on the basis of real data 
and students learn to work with tools for develop- 
ing sophisticated, linguistically motivated, gram- 
mars. 
3.1 Exercise III: Recognizing temporal 
expressions 
A relatively straightforward exercise in grammar 
development is to encode the grammar of Dutch 
temporal expressions in the form of a context-free 
grammar .  
In this particular case, the grammar  is actually 
imp lemented  as a Prolog definite clause grammar .  
Whi le  the top-down,  backtracking, search strat- 
egy of Prolog has certain drawbacks  (most  no- 
tably the fact that it will fail to terminate on left- 
recursive rules), using DCG has the advantage that 
its relationship to context-free grammar  is rela- 
tively transparent, it is easy to use, and  it provides 
some of the concepts also used in more  advanced  
unification-based frameworks.  The  fact that the 
non-terminal symbols  of the grammar  are Pro log 
terms also provides a natural means  for adding an- 
notation in the form of parse-trees or semantics. 
The  task of this exercise was  to develop a 
grammar  for Dutch  tempora l  expressions wh ich  
covers all instances of such expressions found in 
spoken language. The  more  trivial part of the 
lexicon was  given and  a precise format  was  de- 
fined for semantics. The  format  of the grammar  
to be developed is illustrated in figure 5. The  
top rule rewrites a temp_expr  as a weekday,  fol- 
lowed by a date, followed by an hour. An  hour  
rewrites as the ad-hoc category approx imate ly  
(containing several words  wh ich  are not cru- 
cial for semantics but wh ich  frequently occur 
in spontaneous utterances), and  an hour l  cat- 
egory, wh ich  in turn can rewrite as a category 
hour_ lex  followed by the word  uur, followed 
! 
temp_expr(date(Da,Mo,Ye),day(We), 
hour(Ho,Mi)) ..... >

by a min_lex. Assuming suitable definitions 
for the lexical (we-terminal) categories, this will 
generate such strings as zondag v i j f  j anuar i  
omstreeks  t ien  uur v i j f t ien  (Sunday, Jan- 
uary the fifth, at ten fifteen). A more or less com- 
plete grammar of temporal expressions of this sort 
typically contains between 20 and 40 rules. 
A test-corpus was constructed by extract- 
ing 2.500 utterances containing at least one 
lexical item signalling a temporal expression 
(such as a weekday, a month, or words 
such as uur, minuut, week, morgen, kwart, 
omstreeks,  etc.) from a corpus of dialogues col- 
lected from a railway timetable information ser- 
vice. A subset of 200 utterances was annotated. 
The annotation indicates which part of the utter- 
ance is the temporal expression, and its semantics. 
An example is given below. 
sentence (42, \[j a, ik,wil ,reizen, op, 
zesent wint ig, j anuari, s_morgens, om, 
tien,uur,vertrekken\], \[op, 
zesentwintig, j anuari, s_morgens, om, 
tien,uur\], temp(date(_,l,26), 
day( .... 2) ,hour (I0,_))) . 
The raw utterances and 100 annotated utterances 
were made available to students. A grammar can 
now be tested by evaluating how well it manages 
to spot temporal phrases within an utterance and 
assign the correct semantics to it. To this end, a 
parsing scheme was used which returned the (left- 
head_complement_struct(Mthr,Hd,Comp) "- 
head_feature_principle(Mthr,Hd), 
Hd:comp <=> Comp. 
rule(np_pp,vp/VP,\[np/NP,pp/PP,v/V\]) :- 
head_complement_struct(VP,V,np_pp), 
case(NP,acc), 
PP:head:pform <=> aan. 
Figure 6: A fragment of the grammar for Dutch 
most) maximal sub-phrase of an utterance that 
could be parsed as a temporal expression. This re- 
sult was compared with the annotation, thus pro- 
viding a measure for 'word accuracy' and 'seman- 
tic accuracy' of the grammar. The best solutions 
achieved over 95 70 word and semantic accuracy. 
Exerc ise IV: Uni f icat ion grammar  
Linguistically motivated grammars are almost 
without exception based on some variant of uni- 
fication grammar (Shieber, 1986). Head-driven 
phrase structure grammar (HPSG) (Pollard and 
Sag, 1994) is often taken as the theoretical ba- 
sis for such grammars. Although a complete in- 
troduction into the linguistic reasoning underly- 
ing such a framework is beyond the scope of this 
course, as part of a computational linguistics class 
students hould at least gain familiarity with the 
core concepts of unification grammar and some 
of the techniques frequently used to implement 
specific linguistic analyses (underspecification, i -
heritance, gap-threading, unary-rules, empty ele- 
ments, etc.). 
To this end, we developed a core grammar 
of Dutch, demonstrating how subject-verb agree- 
ment, number and gender agreement within NP's ,  
and subcategorization can be accounted for. Fur- 
thermore, it illustrates how a simplified form of 
gap-threading can be used to deal with unbounded 
dependencies, how the movement account for the 
position of the finite verb in main and subordi- 
nate clauses can be mimicked using an 'empty 
verb' and some feature passing, and how auxiliary- 
participle combinations can be described using a 
'verbal complex'. The design of the grammar is 
similar to the ovIs-grammar (van Noord et al, 
1999), in that it uses rules with a relatively specific 
context-free backbone. Inheritance of rules from 
more general 'schemata' and 'principles' is used 
to add feature constraints to these rules without 
redundancy. The schemata nd principles, as well 
as many details of the analysis, are based on HPSG. 
Figure 6 illustrates the general format of phrase 
structure schemata nd feature constraints.

Figure 7: Screenshot of Hdrug 
The grammar fragment is implemented using 
the HDRUG development system 5 (van Noord and 
Bouma, 1997). HDRUG provides a description lan- 
guage for feature constraints, allows rules, lexical 
entries, and 'schemata' or 'principles' to be visu- 
alised in the form of feature matrices, and provides 
an environment for processing example sentences 
which supports the display of derivation trees and 
partial parse results (chart items). A screen-shot 
of HDRUG is given in figure 7. 
As an exercise, students had to extend the 
core fragment with rules and lexical entries for 
additional phrasal categories (PP'S), verbal sub- 
categorization types (verbs selecting for a PP- 
complement), NP constructions (determiner-less 
NP's), verb-clusters (modal+infinitive combina- 
tions), and WH-words (wie, wat, welke, wiens, ho- 
eveel, ... (who, what, which, whose, how many, 
? ..). To test the resulting fragment, students were 
also given a suite of example sentences which had 
to be accepted, as well as a suite of ungrammatical 
sentences. Both test suites were small (consisting 
5www.let.rug.nl/-vannoord/hdrug/ 
of less than 20 sentences each) and constructed by 
hand. This reflects the fact that this exercise is 
primarily concerned with the implementation of a 
sophisticated linguistic analysis? 
4 Natura l  Language Inter faces 
Practical courses in natural language interfaces 
or computational semantics (Pereira and Shieber, 
1987; Blackburn and Bos, 1998) have used a 
toy database, such as geographical database or 
an excerpt of a movie script, as application do- 
main. The growing amount of information avail- 
able on the internet provides opportunities for 
accessing much larger databases (such as public 
transport ime-tables or library catalogues), and 
therefore, for developing more realistic applica- 
tions. In addition, many web-sites provide in- 
formation which is essentially dynamic (weather 
forecasts, stock-market information, etc.), which 
means that applications can be developed which 
go beyond querying or summarising pre-defined 
sets of data. In this section, we describe two ex- 
ercises in which a natural language interface for 
web-accessible information is developed. In both 
cases we used the PILLOW package 6 (Cabeza et al, 
1996) to access data on the web and tfhfislate the " 
resulting HTML-code into Prolog facts. 
4.1 Exercise V: Natural Language 
Generation 
Reiter and Dale (1997) argue that the generation 
of natural language reports from a database with 
numerical data can often be based on low-tech 
processing language engineering techniques uch 
as pattern matching and template filling. Sites 
which provide access to numerical data which is 
subject to change over time, such as weather fore- 
casts or stock quotes, provide an excellent appli- 
cation domain for a simple exercise in language 
generation. 
For instanc% in one exercise, students were 
asked to develop a weather forecast generator, 
which takes the long-term (5 day) forecast of the 
Dutch meteorological institute, KNMI, and pro- 
duces a short text describing the weather of the 
coming days. Students were given a set of pre- 
collected numerical data as well as the text of the 
corresponding weather forecasts as produced by 
the KNMI. These texts served as a 'target cor- 
pus', i.e. as an informal definition of what the 
automatic generation component should be able 
to produce. 
To produce a report generator involved the 
implementation of 'domain knowledge' (a 70% 
chance of rain means that it is 'rainy', if max- 
imum and minimum temperatures do not vary 
more than 2 degrees, the temperature mains the 
same, else there is a change in temperature that 
needs to be reported, etc.) and rules which apply 
the domain knowledge to produce a coherent re- 
port. The latter rules could be any combination 
of' format or write instructions and more advanced 
techniques based on, say, definite clause grammar. 
The completed system can not only be tested on 
pre-collected material, but also on the information 
taken from the current KNMI web-page by using 
the Prolog-HTTP interface. 
A similar exercise was developed for the AEX 
(stock market) application described below. In 
this case, students we asked to write a report gen- 
erator which reports the current state of affairs at 
tile Dutch stock market AEX, using numerical data 
provided by the web-interface to the Dutch news 
service 'NOS teietext' and using similar reports on 
teletext itself as 'target-corpus'.

4.2 Exercise VI: Question answering 
Most natural anguage dialogue systems are inter- 
faces to a database. In such situations, the main 
task of the dialogue system is to answer questions 
formulated by the user. 
The construction of a question-answering sys- 
tem using linguistically-motivated t chniques, re- 
quires (minimally) a domain-specific grammar 
which performs semantic analysis and a com- 
ponent which evaluates the semantic representa- 
tions output by the grammar with respect o the 
database. Once these basic components are work- 
ing, one can try to extend and refine the sys- 
tem by adding (domain-specific or general) disam- 
biguation, contextual-interpretation (of pronouns, 
elliptic expressions, etc), linguistically-motivated 
methods for formulating answers in natural lan- 
guage, and scripts for longer dialogues. 
In the past, we have used information about 
railway time-tables as application domain. Re- 
cently, a rich application domain was created by 
constructing a stock-market game, in which par- 
ticipants (the students taking the class and some 
others) were given an initial sum of money, which 
could be invested in shares. Participants could 
buy and sell shares at wish. Stock quotes were ob- 
tained on-line from the news service 'NOS teletext'. 
Stock-quotes and transactions were collected in a 
database, which, after a few weeks, contained over 
3000 facts. 
The unification-based grammar introduced pre- 
viously (in exercise IV) was adapted for the cur- 
rent domain. This involved adding semantics 
and adding appropriate lexical entries. Further- 
more, a simple question-answering module was 
provided, which takes the semantic representation 
for a question assigned by the grammar (a formula 
in predicate-logic), transforms this into a clause 
which can be evaluated as a Prolog-query, calls 
this query, and returns the answer. 
The exercise for the students was to extend the 
grammar with rules (syntax and semantics) to 
deal with adjectives, with measure phrases (vijf 
euro/procent (five euro/percent), with date ex- 
pressions (op vijf januari (on January, 5)), and 
constructions uch as aandelen Philips (Philips 
shares), and koers van VNU (price of VNU) which 
were assigned a non-standard semantics Next, the 
question system had to be extended so as to han- 
dle a wider range of questions. This involved 
mainly the addition of domain-specific translation 
rules. Upon completion of the exercise, question- 
answer pairs of the sort illustrated in 8 were pos- 
sible. 
Q: wat is de koers van ABN AMR0 
what is the price of ABN AMR0 
A: 17,75 
Q: is het aandeel KPN gisteren gestegen 
have the KPN shares gone up yesterday 
A: ja 
yes 
Q: heeft Rob enige aandelen Baan verkocht 
has Rob sold some Baan shares 
A: nee 
no 
Q: welke spelers bezitten aandelen Baan 
Which players possess Baan shares 
A: gb, woutr, pieter, smb 
Q: hoeveel procent zijn de aandelen kpn 
How many percent have the KPN shares 
gestegen 
gone up 
A: 5

5 Conc lud ing  remarks  
Developing realistic and challenging exercises in 
computational linguistics requires upport in the 
ibrm of development tools and resources. Power- 
ful tools are available for experimenting with finite 
state technology and unification-based grammars, 
resources can be made available asily using in- 
ternet, and current hardware allows students to 
work comibrtably using these tools and resources. 
The introduction of such tools in introductory 
courses has the advantage that it provides a re- 
alistic overview of language technology research 
and development. Interesting application area's 
for natural anguage dialogue systems can be ob- 
tained by exploiting the fact that the internet pro- 
vides access to many on-line databases. The re- 
sulting applications give access to large amounts 
of actual and dynamic information. For educa- 
tional purposes, this has the advantage that it 
gives a feel for the complexity and amount of work 
required to develop 'real' applications. 
The most important problem encountered in de- 
veloping the course is the relative lack of suit- 
able electronic resources. For Dutch, the CELEX 
database provides a rich source of lexical infor- 
mation, which can be used to develop interest- 
ing exercises in computational morphology. De- 
velopment of similar, data-oriented, exercises in 
the area of computational syntax and semantics 
is hindered, however, by the fact that resources, 
such as electronic dictionaries proving valence and 
concept information, and corpora nnotated with 
part of speech, syntactic structure, and semantic 
information, are missing to a large extent. The 
development of such resources would be most wel- 
come, not only for the development of language 
technology for Dutch, but also for educational 
purposes.
