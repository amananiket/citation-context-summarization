Abstract
One of the challenging tasks in the con-
text of the Semantic Web is to automati-
cally extract instances of binary relations
from Web documents ? for example all
pairs of a person and the corresponding
birthdate. In this paper, we present LEILA,
a system that can extract instances of ar-
bitrary given binary relations from natu-
ral language Web documents ? without
human interaction. Different from previ-
ous approaches, LEILA uses a deep syn-
tactic analysis. This results in consistent
improvements over comparable systems
(such as e.g. Snowball or TextToOnto).
1 Introduction
1.1 Motivation
Search engines, question answering systems and
classification systems alike can greatly profit from
formalized world knowledge. Unfortunately, man-
ually compiled collections of world knowledge
(such as e.g. WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998)) often
suffer from low coverage, high assembling costs
and fast aging. In contrast, the World Wide Web
provides an enormous source of knowledge, as-
sembled by millions of people, updated constantly
and available for free. Since the Web data con-
sists mostly of natural language documents, a first
step toward exploiting this data would be to ex-
tract instances of given target relations. For exam-
ple, one might be interested in extracting all pairs
of a person and her birthdate (the birthdate-
relation), pairs of a company and the city of its
headquarters (the headquarters-relation) or
pairs of an entity and the concept it belongs to (the
instanceOf-relation). The task is, given a set
of Web documents and given a target relation, ex-
tracting pairs of entities that are in the target rela-
tion. In this paper, we propose a novel method for
this task, which works on natural language Web
documents and does not require human interac-
tion. Different from previous approaches, our ap-
proach involves a deep linguistic analysis, which
helps it to achieve a superior performance.
1.2 Related Work
There are numerous Information Extraction (IE)
approaches, which differ in various features:
? Arity of the target relation: Some systems are
designed to extract unary relations, i.e. sets of
entities (Finn and Kushmerick, 2004; Califf and
Mooney, 1997). In this paper we focus on the
more general binary relations.
? Type of the target relation: Some systems
are restricted to learning a single relation,
mostly the instanceOf-relation (Cimiano
and Vo?lker, 2005b; Buitelaar et al, 2004).
In this paper, we are interested in extracting
arbitrary relations (including instanceOf).
Other systems are designed to discover new
binary relations (Maedche and Staab, 2000).
However, in our scenario, the target relation is
given in advance.
? Human interaction: There are systems that re-
quire human intervention during the IE process
(Riloff, 1996). Our work aims at a completely
automated system.
? Type of corpora: There exist systems that can
extract information efficiently from formatted
data, such as HTML-tables or structured text
(Graupmann, 2004; Freitag and Kushmerick,
2000). However, since a large part of the Web
consists of natural language text, we consider in
this paper only systems that accept also unstruc-
tured corpora.
? Initialization: As initial input, some systems
require a hand-tagged corpus (J. Iria, 2005;
Soderland et al, 1995), other systems require
text patterns (Yangarber et al, 2000) or tem-
plates (Xu and Krieger, 2003) and again oth-
ers require seed tuples (Agichtein and Gravano,
2000; Ruiz-Casado et al, 2005; Mann and
Yarowsky, 2005) or tables of target concepts
(Cimiano and Vo?lker, 2005a). Since hand-
18
labeled data and manual text patterns require
huge human effort, we consider only systems
that use seed pairs or tables of concepts.
Furthermore, there exist systems that use the
whole Web as a corpus (Etzioni et al, 2004) or that
validate their output by the Web (Cimiano et al,
2005). In order to study different extraction tech-
niques in a controlled environment, however, we
restrict ourselves to systems that work on a closed
corpus for this paper.
One school of extraction techniques concen-
trates on detecting the boundary of interesting en-
tities in the text, (Califf and Mooney, 1997; Finn
and Kushmerick, 2004; Yangarber et al, 2002).
This usually goes along with the restriction to
unary target relations. Other approaches make
use of the context in which an entity appears
(Cimiano and Vo?lker, 2005a; Buitelaar and Ra-
maka, 2005). This school is mostly restricted to
the instanceOf-relation. The only group that
can learn arbitrary binary relations is the group
of pattern matching systems (Etzioni et al, 2004;
Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Ravichandran and
Hovy, 2002; Brin, 1999; Soderland, 1999; Xu et
al., 2002; Ruiz-Casado et al, 2005; Mann and
Yarowsky, 2005). Surprisingly, none of these sys-
tems uses a deep linguistic analysis of the cor-
pus. Consequently, most of them are extremely
volatile to small variations in the patterns. For ex-
ample, the simple subordinate clause in the fol-
lowing example (taken from (Ravichandran and
Hovy, 2002)) can already prevent a surface pat-
tern matcher from discovering a relation between
?London? and the ?river Thames?: ?London, which has
one of the busiest airports in the world, lies on the banks
of the river Thames.?
1.3 Contribution
This paper presents LEILA (Learning to Extract
Information by Linguistic Analysis), a system that
can extract instances of an arbitrary given binary
relation from natural language Web documents
without human intervention. LEILA uses a deep
analysis for natural-language sentences as well as
other advanced NLP methods like anaphora reso-
lution, and combines them with machine learning
techniques for robust and high-yield information
extraction. Our experimental studies on a variety
of corpora demonstrate that LEILA achieves very
good results in terms of precision and recall and
outperforms the prior state-of-the-art methods.
1.4 Link Grammars
There exist different approaches for parsing nat-
ural language sentences. They range from sim-
ple part-of-speech tagging to context-free gram-
mars and more advanced techniques such as Lex-
ical Functional Grammars, Head-Driven Phrase
Structure Grammars or stochastic approaches. For
our implementation, we chose the Link Grammar
Parser (Sleator and Temperley, 1993). It is based
on a context-free grammar and hence it is simpler
to handle than the advanced parsing techniques.
At the same time, it provides a much deeper se-
mantic structure than the standard context-free
parsers. Figure 1 shows a simplified example of
a linguistic structure produced by the link parser
(a linkage).
A linkage is a connected planar undirected
graph, the nodes of which are the words of the sen-
tence. The edges are called links. They are labeled
with connectors. For example, the connector subj
in Figure 1 marks the link between the subject and
the verb of the sentence. The linkage must ful-
fill certain linguistic constraints, which are given
by a link grammar. The link grammar specifies
which word may be linked by which connector to
preceding and following words. Furthermore, the
parser assigns part-of-speech tags, i.e. symbols
identifying the grammatical function of a word in
a sentence. In the example in Figure 1, the let-
ter ?n? following the word ?composers? indentifies
?composers? as a noun.

Figure 2 shows how the Link Parser copes with a
more complex example. The relationship between
the subject ?London? and the verb ?lies? is not dis-
rupted by the subordinate clause:
London, which has one of the busiest airports, lies on the banks of the river Thames.

Figure 2: A complex linkage
We say that a linkage expresses a relation r, if
the underlying sentence implies that a pair of enti-
ties is in r. Note that the deep grammatical anal-
ysis of the sentence would allow us to define the
meaning of the sentence in a theoretically well-
founded way (Montague, 1974). For this paper,
however, we limit ourselves to an intuitive under-
standing of the notion of meaning.
We define a pattern as a linkage in which two
19
words have been replaced by placeholders. Figure
3 shows a pattern derived from the linkage in Fig-
ure 1 by replacing ?Chopin? and ?composers? by the
placeholders ?X? and ?Y?.

Figure 3: A pattern
We call the (unique) shortest path from one
placeholder to the other the bridge, marked in bold
in the figure. The bridge does not include the
placeholders. Two bridges are regarded as equiva-
lent, if they have the same sequence of nodes and
edges, although nouns and adjectives are allowed
to differ. For example, the bridge in Figure 3 and
the bridge in Figure 4 (in bold) are regarded as
equivalent, because they are identical except for
a substitution of ?great? by ?mediocre?. A pattern
matches a linkage, if an equivalent bridge occurs
in the linkage. For example, the pattern in Figure
3 matches the linkage in Figure 4.
Mozart was.v clearly mediocre  among the composers.n.

If a pattern matches a linkage, we say that the
pattern produces the pair of words that the link-
age contains in the position of the placeholders.
In Figure 4, the pair ?Mozart? / ?composers? is pro-
duced by the pattern in Figure 3.
2 System Description
2.1 Document Pre-Processing
LEILA accepts HTML documents as input. To
allow the system to handle date and number ex-
pressions, we normalize these constructions by
regular expression matching in combination with
a set of functions. For example, the expression
?November 23rd to 24th 1998? becomes ?1998-11-23
to 1998-11-24? and the expression ?0.8107 acre-feet?
becomes ?1000 cubic-meters?. Then, we split the
original HTML-document into two files: The first
file contains the proper sentences with the HTML-
tags removed. The second file contains the non-
grammatical parts, such as lists, expressions us-
ing parentheses and other constructions that can-
not be handled by the Link Parser. For example,
the character sequence ?Chopin (born 1810) was a
great composer? is split into the sentence ?Chopin
was a great composer? and the non-grammatical in-
formation ?Chopin (born 1810)?. The grammatical
file is parsed by the Link Parser.
The parsing allows for a restricted named entity
recognition, because the parser links noun groups
like ?United States of America? by designated con-
nectors. Furthermore, the parsing allows us to do
anaphora resolution. We use a conservative ap-
proach, which simply replaces a third person pro-
noun by the subject of the preceding sentence.
For our goal, it is essential to normalize nouns
to their singular form. This task is non-trivial,
because there are numerous words with irregular
plural forms and there exist even word forms that
can be either the singular form of one word or the
plural form of another. By collecting these excep-
tions systematically from WordNet, we were able
to stem most of them correctly with our Plural-to-
Singular Stemmer (PlingStemmer1). For the non-
grammatical files, we provide a pseudo-parsing,
which links each two adjacent items by an artifi-
cial connector. As a result, the uniform output of
the preprocessing is a sequence of linkages, which
constitutes the input for the core algorithm.
2.2 Core Algorithm
As a definition of the target relation, our algorithm
requires a function (given by a Java method) that
decides into which of the following categories a
pair of words falls:
? The pair can be an example for the target re-
lation. For instance, for the birthdate-
relation, the examples can be given by a list of
persons with their birth dates.
? The pair can be a counterexample. For the
birthdate-relation, the counterexamples can
be deduced from the examples (e.g. if ?Chopin?
/ ?1810? is an example, then ?Chopin? / ?2000?
must be a counterexample).
? The pair can be a candidate. For birthdate,
the candidates would be all pairs of a proper
name and a date that are not an example or a
counterexample.
? The pair can be none of the above.
The core algorithm proceeds in three phases:
1. In the Discovery Phase, it seeks linkages in
which an example pair appears. It replaces the
two words by placeholders, thus producing a
pattern. These patterns are collected as positive
patterns. Then, the algorithm runs through the
sentences again and finds all linkages that match
1available at http://www.mpii.mpg.de/ ?suchanek
20
a positive pattern, but produce a counterexam-
ple. The corresponding patterns are collected as
negative patterns2.
2. In the Training Phase, statistical learning is ap-
plied to learn the concept of positive patterns.
The result of this process is a classifier for pat-
terns.
3. In the Testing Phase, the algorithm considers
again all sentences in the corpus. For each link-
age, it generates all possible patterns by replac-
ing two words by placeholders. If the two words
form a candidate and the pattern is classified as
positive, the produced pair is proposed as a new
element of the target relation (an output pair).
In principle, the core algorithm does not depend on
a specific grammar or a specific parser. It can work
on any type of grammatical structures, as long as
some kind of pattern can be defined on them. It is
also possible to run the Discovery Phase and the
Testing Phase on different corpora.
2.3 Learning Model
The central task of the Discovery Phase is deter-
mining patterns that express the target relation.
These patterns are generalized in the Training
Phase. In the Testing Phase, the patterns are used
to produce the output pairs. Since the linguistic
meaning of the patterns is not apparent to the sys-
tem, the Discovery Phase relies on the following
hypothesis: Whenever an example pair appears
in a sentence, the linkage and the corresponding
pattern express the target relation. This hypoth-
esis may fail if a sentence contains an example
pair merely by chance, i.e. without expressing the
target relation. Analogously, a pattern that does
express the target relation may occasionally pro-
duce counterexamples. We call these patterns false
samples. Virtually any learning algorithm can deal
with a limited number of false samples.
To show that our approach does not depend
on a specific learning algorithm, we implemented
two classifiers for LEILA: One is an adaptive k-
Nearest-Neighbor-classifier (kNN) and the other
one uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM). These
classifiers, the feature selection and the statistical
model are explained in detail in (Suchanek et al,
2006). Here, we just note that the classifiers yield
a real valued label for a test pattern. This value
can be interpreted as the confidence of the classifi-
cation. Thus, it is possible to rank the output pairs
of LEILA by their confidence.
2Note that different patterns can match the same linkage.
3 Experiments
3.1 Setup
We ran LEILA on different corpora with increasing
heterogeneity:
? Wikicomposers: The set of all Wikipedia arti-
cles about composers (872 HTML documents).
We use it to see how LEILA performs on a docu-
ment collection with a strong structural and the-
matic homogeneity.
? Wikigeography: The set of all Wikipedia
pages about the geography of countries (313
HTML documents).
? Wikigeneral: A set of random Wikipedia arti-
cles (78141 HTML documents). We chose it to
assess LEILA?s performance on structurally ho-
mogenous, but thematically random documents.
? Googlecomposers: This set contains one doc-
ument for each baroque, classical, and roman-
tic composer in Wikipedia?s list of composers,
as delivered by a Google ?I?m feeling lucky?
search for the composer?s name (492 HTML
documents). We use it to see how LEILA per-
forms on a corpus with a high structural hetero-
geneity. Since the querying was done automat-
ically, the downloaded pages include spurious
advertisements as well as pages with no proper
sentences at all.
We tested LEILA on different target relations with
increasing complexity:
? birthdate: This relation holds between a person
and his birth date (e.g. ?Chopin? / ?1810?). It is
easy to learn, because it is bound to strong sur-
face clues (the first element is always a name,
the second is always a date).
? synonymy: This relation holds between two
names that refer to the same entity (e.g.
?UN?/?United Nations?). The relation is more so-
phisticated, since there are no surface clues.
? instanceOf: This relation is even more sophis-
ticated, because the sentences often express it
only implicitly.
We compared LEILA to different competitors. We
only considered competitors that, like LEILA, ex-
tract the information from a corpus without using
other Internet sources. We wanted to avoid run-
ning the competitors on our own corpora or on our
own target relations, because we could not be sure
to achieve a fair tuning of the competitors. Hence
we ran LEILA on the corpora and the target rela-
tions that our competitors have been tested on by
their authors. We compare the results of LEILA
with the results reported by the authors. Our com-
petitors, together with their respective corpora and
relations, are:
21
? TextToOnto3: A state-of-the-art representative
for non-deep pattern matching. The system pro-
vides a component for the instanceOf rela-
tion and takes arbitrary HTML documents as in-
put. For completeness, we also consider its suc-
cessor Text2Onto (Cimiano and Vo?lker, 2005a),
although it contains only default methods in its
current state of development.
? Snowball (Agichtein and Gravano, 2000):
A recent representative of the slot-extraction
paradigm. In the original paper, Snowball has
been tested on the headquarters relation.
This relation holds between a company and the
city of its headquarters. Snowball was trained
on a collection of some thousand documents
and then applied to a test collection. For copy-
right reasons, we only had access to the test col-
lection (150 text documents).
? (Cimiano and Vo?lker, 2005b) present a new sys-
tem that uses context to assign a concept to
an entity. We will refer to this system as the
CV-system. The approach is restricted to the
instanceOf-relation, but it can classify in-
stances even if the corpus does not contain ex-
plicit definitions. In the original paper, the sys-
tem was tested on a collection of 1880 files from
the Lonely Planet Internet site4.
For the evaluation, the output pairs of the sys-
tem have to be compared to a table of ideal pairs.
One option would be to take the ideal pairs from a
pre-compiled data base. The problem is that these
ideal pairs may differ from the facts expressed in
the documents. Furthermore, these ideal pairs do
not allow to measure how much of the document
content the system actually extracted. This is why
we chose to extract the ideal pairs manually from
the documents. In our methodology, the ideal pairs
comprise all pairs that a human would understand
to be elements of the target relation. This involves
full anaphora resolution, the solving of reference
ambiguities, and the choice of truly defining con-
cepts. For example, we accept Chopin as instance
of composer but not as instance of member,
even if the text says that he was a member of some
club. Of course, we expect neither the competi-
tors nor LEILA to achieve the results in the ideal
table. However, this methodology is the only fair
way of manual extraction, as it is guaranteed to
be system-independent. If O denotes the multi-
set of the output pairs and I denotes the multi-set
of the ideal pairs, then precision, recall, and their
3http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/texttoonto
4http://www.lonelyplanet.com/
harmonic mean F1 can be computed as
recall = |O ? I||I| precision =
|O ? I|
|O|
F1 = 2 ? recall ? precisionrecall + precision .
To ensure a fair comparison of LEILA to Snow-
ball, we use the same evaluation as employed in
the original Snowball paper (Agichtein and Gra-
vano, 2000), the Ideal Metric. The Ideal Metric
assumes the target relation to be right-unique (i.e.
a many-to-one relation). Hence the set of ideal
pairs is right-unique. The set of output pairs can
be made right-unique by selecting the pair with the
highest confidence for each first component. Du-
plicates are removed from the ideal pairs and also
from the output pairs. All output pairs that have
a first component that is not in the ideal set are
removed.
There is one special case for the CV-system,
which uses the Ideal Metric for the non-right-
unique instanceOf relation. To allow for a fair
comparison, we used the Relaxed Ideal Metric,
which does not make the ideal pairs right-unique.
The calculation of recall is relaxed as follows:
recall = |O ? I||{x|?y : (x, y) ? I}|
Due to the effort, we could extract the ideal pairs
only for a sub-corpus. To ensure significance in
spite of this, we compute confidence intervals for
our estimates: We interpret the sequence of out-
put pairs as a repetition of a Bernoulli-experiment,
where the output pair can be either correct (i.e.
contained in the ideal pairs) or not. The parameter
of this Bernoulli-distribution is the precision. We
estimate the precision by drawing a sample (i.e.
by extracting all ideal pairs in the sub-corpus). By
assuming that the output pairs are identically in-
dependently distributed, we can calculate a confi-
dence interval for our estimation. We report confi-
dence intervals for precision and recall for a con-
fidence level of ? = 95%. We measure precision
at different levels of recall and report the values
for the best F1 value. We used approximate string
matching techniques to account for different writ-
ings of the same entity. For example, we count
the output pair ?Chopin? / ?composer? as correct,
even if the ideal pairs contain ?Frederic Chopin? /
?composer?. To ensure that LEILA does not just
reproduce the example pairs, we list the percent-
age of examples among the output pairs. During
our evaluation, we found that the Link Grammar
parser does not finish parsing on roughly 1% of
the files for unknown reasons.

3.2 Results
3.2.1 Results on different relations
Table 1 summarizes our experimental results
with LEILA on different relations. For the birth-
date relation, we used Edward Morykwas? list of
famous birthdays5 as examples. As counterexam-
ples, we chose all pairs of a person that was in the
examples and an incorrect birthdate. All pairs of
a proper name and a date are candidates. We ran
LEILA on the Wikicomposer corpus. LEILA per-
formed quite well on this task. The patterns found
were of the form ?X was born in Y ? and ?X (Y )?.
For the synonymy relation we used all pairs
of proper names that share the same synset in
WordNet as examples (e.g. ?UN?/?United Na-
tions?). As counterexamples, we chose all pairs of
nouns that are not synonymous in WordNet (e.g.
?rabbit?/?composer?). All pairs of proper names are
candidates. We ran LEILA on the Wikigeography
corpus, because this set is particularly rich in syn-
onyms. LEILA performed reasonably well. The
patterns found include ?X was known as Y ? as well
as several non-grammatical constructions such as
?X (formerly Y )?.
For the instanceOf relation, it is difficult to se-
lect example pairs, because if an entity belongs
to a concept, it also belongs to all super-concepts.
However, admitting each pair of an entity and one
of its super-concepts as an example would result in
far too many false positives. The problem is to de-
termine for each entity the (super-)concept that is
most likely to be used in a natural language defini-
tion of that entity. Psychological evidence (Rosch
et al, 1976) suggests that humans prefer a certain
layer of concepts in the taxonomy to classify en-
tities. The set of these concepts is called the Ba-
sic Level. Heuristically, we found that the low-
est super-concept in WordNet that is not a com-
pound word is a good approximation of the ba-
5http://www.famousbirthdates.com
sic level concept for a given entity. We used all
pairs of a proper name and the corresponding ba-
sic level concept of WordNet as examples. We
could not use pairs of proper names and incorrect
super-concepts as counterexamples, because our
corpus Wikipedia knows more meanings of proper
names than WordNet. Therefore, we used all pairs
of a common noun and an incorrect super-concept
from WordNet as counterexamples. All pairs of
a proper name and a WordNet concept are candi-
dates.
We ran LEILA on the Wikicomposers corpus.
The performance on this task was acceptable, but
not impressive. However, the chances to obtain a
high recall and a high precision were significantly
decreased by our tough evaluation policy: The
ideal pairs include tuples deduced by resolving
syntactic and semantic ambiguities and anaphoras.
Furthermore, our evaluation policy demands that
non-defining concepts like member not be cho-
sen as instance concepts. In fact, a high propor-
tion of the incorrect assignments were friend,
member, successor and predecessor, de-
creasing the precision of LEILA. Thus, compared
to the gold standard of humans, the performance
of LEILA can be considered reasonably good. The
patterns found include the Hearst patterns (Hearst,
1992) ?Y such as X?, but also more complex pat-
terns like ?X was known as a Y ?, ?X [. . . ] as Y ?, ?X
[. . . ] can be regarded as Y ? and ?X is unusual among
Y ?. Some of these patterns could not have been
found by primitive regular expression matching.
To test whether thematic heterogeneity influ-
ences LEILA, we ran it on the Wikigeneral corpus.
Finally, to try the limits of our system, we ran it on
the Googlecomposers corpus. As shown in Table
1, the performance of LEILA dropped in these in-
creasingly challenging tasks, but LEILA could still
produce useful results. We can improve the results
on the Googlecomposers corpus by adding the Wi-
kicomposers corpus for training.
23
The different learning methods (kNN and SVM)
performed similarly for all relations. Of course, in
each of the cases, it is possible to achieve a higher
precision at the price of a lower recall. The run-
time of the system splits into parsing (? 40s for
each document, e.g. 3:45h for Wikigeography)
and the core algorithm (2-15min for each corpus,
5h for the huge Wikigeneral).
3.2.2 Results with different competitors
Table 2 shows the results for comparing LEILA
against various competitors (with LEILA in bold-
face). We compared LEILA to TextToOnto and
Text2Onto for the instanceOf relation on the
Wikicomposers corpus. TextToOnto requires an
ontology as source of possible concepts. We gave
it the WordNet ontology, so that it had the same
preconditions as LEILA. Text2Onto does not re-
quire any input. Text2Onto seems to have a preci-
sion comparable to ours, although the small num-
ber of found pairs does not allow a significant con-
clusion. Both systems have drastically lower recall
than LEILA.
For Snowball, we only had access to the test
corpus. Hence we trained LEILA on a small por-
tion (3%) of the test documents and tested on
the remaining ones. Since the original 5 seed
pairs that Snowball used did not appear in the col-
lection at our disposal, we chose 5 other pairs
as examples. We used no counterexamples and
hence omitted the Training Phase of our algorithm.
LEILA quickly finds the pattern ?Y -based X?. This
led to very high precision and good recall, com-
pared to Snowball ? even though Snowball was
trained on a much larger training collection.
The CV-system differs from LEILA, because its
ideal pairs are a table, in which each entity is as-
signed to its most likely concept according to a hu-
man understanding of the text ? independently of
whether there are explicit definitions for the entity
in the text or not. We conducted two experiments:
First, we used the document set used in Cimiano
and Vo?lker?s original paper (Cimiano and Vo?lker,
2005a), the Lonely Planet corpus. To ensure a
fair comparison, we trained LEILA separately on
the Wikicomposers corpus, so that LEILA cannot
have example pairs in its output. For the evalu-
ation, we calculated precision and recall with re-
spect to an ideal table provided by the authors.
Since the CV-system uses a different ontology, we
allowed a distance of 4 edges in the WordNet hi-
erarchy to count as a match (for both systems).
Since the explicit definitions that our system relies
on were sparse in the corpus, LEILA performed
worse than the competitor. In a second experi-
ment, we had the CV-system run on the Wikicom-
posers corpus. As the CV-system requires a set
of target concepts, we gave it the set of all con-
cepts in our ideal pairs. Furthermore, the sys-
tem requires an ontology on these concepts. We
gave it the WordNet ontology, pruned to the tar-
get concepts with their super-concepts. We evalu-
ated by the Relaxed Ideal Metric, again allowing
a distance of 4 edges in the WordNet hierarchy to
count as a match (for both systems). This time,
our competitor performed worse. This is because
our ideal table is constructed from the definitions
in the text, which our competitor is not designed
to follow. These experiments only serve to show
the different philosophies in the definition of the
ideal pairs for the CV-system and LEILA. The CV-
system does not depend on explicit definitions, but
it is restricted to the instanceOf-relation.
4 Conclusion and Outlook
We addressed the problem of automatically ex-
tracting instances of arbitrary binary relations
from natural language text. The key novelty of our
approach is to apply a deep syntactic analysis to
this problem. We have implemented our approach
and showed that our system LEILA outperforms
existing competitors.
Our current implementation leaves room for fu-
ture work. For example, the linkages allow for
more sophisticated ways of resolving anaphoras
or matching patterns. LEILA could learn nu-
merous interesting relations (e.g. country /
president or isAuthorOf) and build up an
ontology from the results with high confidence.
LEILA could acquire and exploit new corpora on
its own (e.g., it could read newspapers) and it
could use its knowledge to acquire and structure
its new knowledge more efficiently. We plan to
exploit these possibilities in our future work.
