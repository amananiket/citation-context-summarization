In GB, the importance of phrase-structure 
rules has dwindled in favour of nearness 
conditions. Today, nearness conditions play 
a major role in defining the correct linguis- 
tic representations. They are expressed in 
terms of special binary relations on trees 
called command relations. Yet, while the 
formal theory of phrase-structure gram- 
mars is quite advanced, no formal investi- 
gation into the properties of command re- 
lations has been done. We will try to close 
this gap. In particular, we will study the in- 
trinsic properties of command relations as 
relations on trees as well as the possibil- 
ity to reduce nearness conditions expressed 
by command relations to phrase-structure 
rules. 
1 In t roduct ion  
1.1 Historic Origin 
Early transformational grammar consisted of a 
rather complex generative component and an equally 
complex and equally imperspicuous transformational 
component. But since the aim always has been to 
understand languages rather than describing them, 
there has been a need for a reduction of these rule 
systems into preferably few and simple principles. 
The analysis of transformations a  series of move- 
ments - an analysis made possible by the introduc- 
tion of empty categories - was one step. This in- 
deed drastically simplified the transformational com- 
ponent. A second step consisted in simplifying the 
generative component by reducing the rules in favour 
of well-formedness conditions, o-called filters. While 
this turned transformational grammar into a real 
theory now known as GB, the relationship of GB with 
other syntactic formalisms such as GPSG, LFG, cate- 
gorial grammar etc. became less and less clear. This 
in addition to Noam Chomsky's often repeated scep- 
ticism with respect o formalizations has led to the 
common attitude that GB is simply gibberish, unfor- 
malizable or hopelessly untractable at best. How- 
ever, since it is possible to evaluate predictions of 
theories of GB and have constructive debates over 
them these theories are if not formal then at least 
rigorous. Hence, it must be possible to formalize 
them. Formalizations of GB have been offered, e. g. 
in \[Stabler, 1989\] hut in a manner that makes 6B 
even less comprehensible. So if formalization means 
providing as complete as possible intellectual ccess 
to the formal consequences of an otherwise rigor- 
ously defined theory the project has failed if ever 
begun. More or less the same criticism applies to 
\[Gazdar et al, 1985\]. Even if 6PsG is rigorously de- 
fined the formalism as laid out in this book does not 
lead to an understanding of it's properties. More or 
less the same applies to categorial grammar which 
might have the advantage that it's formal proper- 
ties are well-studied but which suffers from the same 
ill-suitedness to the human intellect. The situation 
can be compared with computer science. While it is 
perfectly possible to reduce programs in PASCAL to 
programs in machine language, hardly is anyone in- 
terested in doing so. Even if machine language suits 
the machine, we need to provide a higher language 
and a translation to make computers eally useful for 
practical tasks. However, as long as we do not know 
in linguistics what the 'machine language' of the hu- 
man mind is, the best we can do at the moment is 
to provide means to translate in between all these 
syntactical formalisms. So, even if from the point of 
240 
view of universal grammar this gets us no closer to 
the language faculty of the human mind, the need to 
understand the formal properties of Gs and the re- 
lationship between all these approaches remains and 
must be satisfied in order to achieve real progress. 
The theory of command relations forms part of an 
investigation that should ultimately lead to such an 
understanding. The present paper will sketch the 
theory of command relation and is a distilled version 
of \[Kracht, 1993\]. 
1.2 Re levance  o f  Command Re lat ions  
The idea to study the formal properties of command 
relations is due to \[Barker and Pullum, 1990\]. There 
we find a definition of command relations as well as 
many illustrations of command relations from lin- 
guistic theory. In that paper the origins of the no- 
tions are also discussed. I guess it is fair to attribute 
to \[l~inhart, 1981\] the beginning of the study of do- 
mains. Moreover, \[Koster, 1986\] presents a impres- 
sive and thorough study of the role of domains in 
grammar. Yet al this work is either too specific 
or too vague to lead to a proper understanding of 
nearness conditions in grammar. In \[Kracht, 1992\] I 
took the case of \[Barker and Pullum, 1990\] further 
and proved some more results concerning these rela- 
tions especially the structure of the heyting algebra 
of command relations. The latter proved to be of 
little significance in the light of the questions raised 
in ? 1.1. Instead, it emerged that it is more fruitful 
to study the properties of command relations under 
intersection, union and relational composition. They 
form an algebraic structure called a distributoid. The 
structure of this distributoid can be determined. If 
the grammar is enriched with enough labels, this dis- 
tributoid contains enough command relations to ex- 
press all known nearness conditions. This being so, 
it becomes an immediate question whether the ef- 
fect of a nearness condition expressed via command 
relations can be incorporated into the syntax. This 
is discussed at length in \[Kracht, 1993\]. The result 
is that indeed all such conditions are implementable, 
but this often requires a lot more basic features. The 
explosion of the size grammars when translating from 
GB to GPSG can be explained namely by the neces- 
sity to add auxiliary features that secure that the 
grammar obeys certain nearness restrictions. A typ- 
ical example is the SLASH-feature which has been 
invented to guarantee a gap for a displaced filler. 
With such proof that implementations of nearness 
conditions into cfg's can always be given (maybe on 
certain other harmless conditions) one is in principle 
dispensed from writing GVSG-type grammars in or- 
der to make available the rich theory of context-free 
grammars. Now it is possible to transfer this the- 
ory to grammars which consist both of a generative 
context-free component and a set of well-formedness 
conditions based on command relations. In particu- 
lar, it is perfectly decidable whether two such gram- 
mars generate the same bracketed strings and hence 
effective comparison between two different heories 
of natural language - if given in that format - is 
possible. 
2 Grammat ica l  Re la t ions  on  Trees  
2.1 Def in i t ions  
A t ree  is an object T = iT, <, r) with r the root  and 
< a tree ordering. We write x -4 y if z is immediately 
dominated by y; in mathematical jargon y is said to 
cover  z. A leaf  is an element which does not cover; z 
is in ter io r  if it is neither a leaf nor the root. int(T) is 
the set of interior nodes ofT.  We put ~ x = {YlY < x} 
and \]" z = {YlY >-- Z}. ~ X is called the lower and T z 
the upper  cone of z. If R C_ 7 '2 is a binary relation 
we write Rx = {ylxRy} and call Rz the R -domaln  
of z. A function f : T ~ T is called monotone  if 
z < y implies f (x)  < f(y),  i nc reas ing  if  z <_ f(x)  
for all x, and s t r i c t ly  increas ing  if z < f (z )  for all 
x<r .  
Def in i t ion  1 A binary relation R C T 2 is called a 
command re la t ion  (CR for short) iff there ex- 
ists a function fR : T ~ T such that (1), (~) and (8) 
hold; R is called monotone  if in addition it sat- 
isfies (4) and t ight  if it satisfies (5) in addition to 
(1) - (3). fR is called the assoc ia ted  funct ion  
of R. 
(1) Rr = ~fR(x) 
(2) z < fR(z) for all z < r 
(3) fRO ' )  = ," 
(4) z < y implies fR(z) < fR(Y) 
(5) x < fR(y) impZies fR(x) <_ fR(y). 
(1) expresses that fR(z)  represents R; (2) and (3) ex- 
press that fR must be strictly increasing. If (4) holds, 
fR is monotone. A tight relation is monotone; for if 
z _< y and y < r then y < fR(Y) and so z < fR(Y); 
whence fR(z) _< fR(Y) by (5). For some reason 
\[Barker and Pullum, 1990\] do not count monotonic- 
ity as a defining property of CRs even though there 
is no known command relation that fails to be mono- 
tone. 
Given a set P _C T we can define a function gp by 
(t) gp(z) = min{yly ? P, y > z} 
We put minO = r; thus gp(r) = r. Let zPy iff 
y < gp(z), gp is the associated function of P, a 
relation commonly referred to as P -command.  We 
call P the basic set of gp as well as P. 
Here are some examples. With  P the set of branch- 
ing nodes P is c-command, with P = T we have that 
P is IDC-command. When we take P to be the set of 
maximal projections we obtain that P is M-command, 
and, finally, with P the set of bounding nodes, e. g. 
{NP, S}, the relation P defined becomes identical to 
Lasnik's KOMMAND. Lasnik's KOMMAND i8 identical 
to 1-node subjacency under the typical definition of 
subjacency. 
241 
Relations that are of the form P for some P are 
called fair. 
Theorem 2 R is fair iff it is tight. There are 
2 ~I"'(T) distinct tight CRs on T. 
Proof .  (=~) Assume x < gp(y) = min{z E Plz > 
y}. Then gp(z) = min{z E P\]z > z} <_ gp(y) 
since gp(y) E P. (?:) Put P = {fR(z)\]z E T}. 
We have to show (t)- By (5), however, f it(z) = 
min{fit(z)\]fit(z) > z}. For the second claim observe 
first that if P, Q differ only in exterior nodes then 
P = Q. If, however, z E P - Q is interior then y -< z 
for some y and gp(y) = z but go(Y) > z. ? 
Tight relations have an important property; even 
when the structure of the tree is lost and we know 
only P we can recover gp and < to some extent. No- 
tice namely that if Px ? T then gp(z) is the unique 
y such that y E Px but the P-domain of y is larger 
than the P-domain of z. We can then exactly say 
which elements are dominated by y: exactly the el- 
ements of the P-domain of z. By consequence, if 
we are given T, the root r and we know the IDC- 
command omains, < can be recovered completely. 
This is of relevance to syntax because often the tree 
structures are not given directly but are recovered 
using domains. 
2.2 Lat t i ce  S t ructure  
Let f,  g be increasing functions; then define 
( f  LIg)(z)  "- maz{f(z),g(z)} 
( f  ng) (z )  = min{f(z),g(z)} 
( fog)(z)  = f (g(z))  
Since f (z ) ,g (z )  >_ z, that is, f ( z ) ,g (z )  E ~z and 
since T z is linear, the maximum and minimum are 
always defined. Clearly, with f and g increasing, f LI 
g, f\[qg and fog are also increasing. Furthermore, if f 
and g are strictly increasing, the composite functions 
are strictly increasing as well. 
Lemma 3 fRus = fit U fs. fitns = fit R fs.  
Proof .  z <_ fitus(X) iff z (R U S)z iff either zRz 
or zSz iff either z <_ fR(z) or z < fs(z) iff z < 
maz{fR(z), fs(z)}.  Analogously for intersection, i 
Theorem 4 For any given tree T the command re- 
lations over T form a distributive lattice Er(T) = 
(Cr(T), N, U) which contains the lattice 93Ion(T) of 
monotone CRs as a sublattice. 
Proof .  By the above lemma, the CRs over T are 
closed under intersection and union. Distributivity 
automatically follows since lattices isomorphic to lat- 
tices of sets with intersection and union as opera- 
tions are always distributive. The second claim fol- 
lows from the fact that if fR, fs are both monotone, 
so is fit I I fs  and fit n fs. We prove one of these 
claims. Assume z < y. Then f it(z) _< fa(Y) and 
fs (z)  _< fs(Y), hence f it(z) _< max{fR(y),fs(y)} 
as well as fs(=) <_ maz{fit(u), fs(u)}.  So 
max{fit(=), fs(=)} _< max{fn(y), fs(y)} and ther - 
fore fRus(z) < fRus(y), by definition. ?
P ropos i t ion  5 gPuq = gP \[7 go. Hence tight rela- 
tions over a tree are closed under intersection. They 
are generally not closed under closed union. 
Proof. Let P, Q c_ T be two sets upon which the 
relations P and Q are basedl Then the intersection of 
the relations, P N Q, is derived from the union P U Q 
of the basic sets. Namely, gpuq(Z) = min{yly E PU 
Q,y > z} = min{min{yly E P ,y  > z}, min{yly E 
Q,y > z}} = min{gp(z) ,go(z)}  = (gp r\] go) (x ) .  
To see that tight relations are not necessarily closed 
under union take the union of N P-command and S- 
command. If it were tight, the nodes of the form g(z) 
for some z define the set on which this relation must 
be based. But this set is exactly the set of bounding 
nodes, which defines Lasnik's kommand. The latter, 
however, is the intersection, not the union of these 
relations. ? 
The consequences of this theorem are the follow- 
ing. The tight relations form a sub-semilattice of the 
lattice of command relations; this semi-lattice is iso- 
morphic to (2 int(T), U). Although the natural join of 
tight relations is not necessarily tight, it is possible 
to define a join in the semi-lattice. This operation 
is completely determined by the meet-semilattice 
structure, because this structure determines the par- 
tial order of the elements which in turn defines the 
join. In order to distinguish this join from the or- 
dinary one we write it as P ? Q. The corresponding 
basic set from which this relation is generated is the 
set PNQ; this is the only choice, beacuse the semilat- 
mr(T) t ice/2' , U) allows only one extension to a lattice, 
namely (2 int(T), U, N). The notation for associated 
functions is the same as for the relations. If gp and 
gq are associated functions, then gp ? go = gPnq 
denotes the associated function of the (tight) join. 
2.3 Compos i t ion  
For monotone relations there is more structure. Con- 
sider the definition of the relationM product 
R o S = {(z, z) l(3y)(znyaz)} 
Then fitos = fs o fR (with converse ordering!). For 
a proof consider the largest z such that x(R o S)z. 
Then there exists a g such that zRySz. Now let 
tj be the largest g such that zRy. Then not only 
zR~ but also tgSz, since S is monotone. By choice 
of ~, ~ = fn(z) .  By choice of z, z = fs(~t), since 
fs(~t) > z would contradict he maximality of z. In 
total, z = (fs o f i t)(z) and that had to be proved. 
From the theory of binary relations it is known 
that o distributes over U, that is, that we have R o 
(S U T) = (R o S) U (R o T) as well as (S U T) o R = 
(S o R) U (T o R). But in this special setting o also 
distributes over N. 
P ropos i t ion  6 Let R, S, T be monotone CRs. Then 
Ro(SNT)  = (RoS)  N(RoT) , (SNT)o  R= (So 
R) N (T o R). 
Proof .  Let z(R o (S N T))z, that is, zRy(S N T)z, 
that is, zRySz and zRyTz for some y. Then, by 
242 
definition, x(R o S)z and x(R o T)z and so x((R o 
S) fq (R o T))z. Conversely, if the latter is true then 
x(R o S)z and x(R o T)z and so there are Yl, Y2 with 
xRylSz and xRy2Tz. With y - max{yl,y2} we 
have xRy(S M T)z since S, T are monotone. Thus 
x(R o (s  n T))z. Now for the second claim. Assume 
z((S N T) o R)z, that is, x(S fq T)yRz for some y. 
Then xSy, xTy and yRz, which means x(SoR)z and 
x(T  o R)z and so x((S o R) M (T o R))z. Conversely, 
if the latter holds then x(S o R)z and x(T o R)z and 
so there exist Yl, Y2 with xSylRz and xTy2Rz. Put 
y = rain{y1, Y2}. Then xSy, xTy, hence x(S M T)y. 
Moreover, yRz, from which x( ( S N T) o R)z. ? 
Def in i t ion  7 A d i s t r ibuto id  is a structure fO = 
(D, N, U, o) such thai (1) (D, n, u) is a distributive 
lattice, (2) o an associative operation and (3) o dis- 
tributes both over M and U. 
Theorem 8 The monotone CRs over a given tree 
form a distributoid enoted by ~Diz(T). ? 
2.4 Normal  Forms 
The fact that distributoids have so many distributive 
laws means that for composite CRs there are quite 
simple normal forms. Namely, if 9t is a CR com- 
posed from the CRs R1,. ?., Rn by means of M, U and 
o, then we can reproduce 91 in the following simple 
form. Call ~ a cha in  if it is composed from the Ri 
using only o. Then 91 is identical to an intersection 
of unions of chains, and it is identical to a union of 
intersections of chains. Namely, by (3), both M and 
U can be moved outside the scope of o. Moreover, fl 
can be moved outside the scope of U and U can be 
moved outside the scope of N. 
Theorem 9 (Normal  Forms)  
For every 91 = 91(R1, . . . ,Rn)  there exist chains 
? { = ?{(R1, . . ,n , )  a.d = such 
that 91 = Ui with = Ni and 91 = with 
= N, ? 
From the linguistic point of view, tight relations play 
a key role because they are defined as a kind of topo- 
logical closure of nodes with respect o the topology 
induced by the various categories. (However, this 
analogy is not perfect because the topological clo- 
sure is an idempotent operation while the domain 
closure yields larger and larger sets, eventually being 
the whole tree.) It is therefore reasonable to assume 
that all kinds of linguistic CRs be defined using tight 
relations as primitives. Indeed, \[Koster, 1986\] argues 
for quite specific choices of fundamental relations, 
which will be discussed below. It is worthwile to ask 
how much can be defined from tight relations. This 
proves to yield quite unexpected answers. Namely, 
it turns out that union can be eliminated in presence 
of intersection and composition. We prove this first 
for the most simple case. 
Lemma 10 Let gp, go be the associated functions of 
tight relations. Then 
gp u go = (gP o go) n (go o gp) n (gp ? go) 
Proof .  First of all, since gP,gO <- gP o go,go o 
gP,gP ?gO we have gp I Igo  < (gP?gq)  \ [q (go?  
gP) 1-\] (gP ? go). The converse inequation needs to 
be established. There are three cases for a node 
z. (i) gp(z) = go(x). Then (gp U go)(z) = 
gpnq(X) = (gp ? go)(x), because the next P-node 
above z is identical to the next Q-node above z 
and so is identical to the next P N Q-node above 
z. (it) gp(x) < go(z). Then with y = gp(x) 
we also have gQ(y) = go(z), by tightness. Hence 
(gp U go)(x)  = (go o gp)(z) .  (iii) gp(x) >g0(z ) .  
Then as in (it) (gp LI gq)(x)  = (gp o go)(z). 
The next case is the union of two chains of tight 
relations. Let g = grn ogm_ l . . .ogz  and 0 = 
h,  o ha-  1 -. ? o hi be two associated functions of such 
chains. Then define a spl ice of g and ~ to be any 
chain t = kt o k t -1 . . .o  kl such that ? = m+ n and 
ki = gj or ki = hj for some j and each gi and hj 
occurs exactly once and the order of the gi as well as 
the order of the hi in the splice is as in their original 
chain. So, the situation is comparable with shuffling 
two decks of cards into each other. A weak  spl ice 
is obtained from a splice by replacing some number 
of gi o hj and hj o gi by gi * hi, least tight relation 
containing both gi and hi. In a weak splice, the 
shuffling is not perfect in the sense that some pairs 
of cards may be glued to each other. I f  g = g2 o gl 
and 0 = h2 o hi then the following are all splices of g 
and 0: g2?gl ?h2?hl ,  g2?h2?gl ?hl, g2?h2?hl ?gz ?
The following are weak splices (in addition to the 
splices, which are also weak splices): g2 091 ? h2 0 hi, 
g2 ? h2 0 gl ? hi. A non-splice is gl 0 h2 0 g2 0 hi, and 
g2 ? gl 0 h2 0 hi is not a weak splice. 
Lemma 11 Let g, ~ be two chains of tight relations 
(or their associated functions). Let wk(g, O) be the 
set of weak splices of g and b. Then 
u b = R @Is wk@, b)) 
Proof .  As before, it is not difficult to show that 
o < n( l. wk(g ,  because g, 0 _< s for 
each weak splice. So it is enough to show that the 
left hand side is equal to one of the weak splices in 
any tree for any given node. Consider therefore a 
tree T and a node z E T. We define a weak splice 
s such that s(z) = maz{g(z), b(z)}. To this end 
we define the following nodes, z0 = z, y0 = z, 
Z1 = gl(xo),hl(YO),...,xi+l = gi+l(Zi),Yi+l -- 
hi+l(yl),.... The zi and the yi each form an in- 
creasing sequence. We can also assume that both 
sequences are strictly increasing because otherwise 
there would be an i such that zi = r or Yi = r. Then 
(@ U D)(z) = r and so for any weak splice z(z) = r 
as well. So, all the xi can be assumed distinct and 
243 
all the yi as well. Now we define zi as follows. 
zo = x, Zl = min{xz , . . . , zm,yt , . . . , y ,} , . . . , z i+t  = 
min({zz , . . . ,  zm, yz , . . . ,  Y,~} - {Zl , . . . ,  zl}). Thus, 
the sequence of the zi is obtained by fusing the two 
sequences along the order given by the upper seg- 
ment T z. Finally, the weak splice can be defined. 
We begin with st. I f z t  = yl, $1 = g l?h l ,  i f z t  < Yz, 
sz = 91 and if zz > yl then sz = hi. Generally, for 
zi+z there are three cases. First, zi+z = zj = Yk for 
some j, k. Then si+t = gj ? hk. Else zi+z = zj for 
some j,  but Zi+l ? y~ for all k. Then si+t = gj. Or 
else zi+t = yk for some k but zi+z ? zj for all j; 
then si+t = hk. It is straightforward to show that 
z as just defined is a weak splice, that zi+z = si(zi) 
and hence that z(z) = maz{0(z), t)(z)}. ? 
The tight relations generate a subdistributoid 
Sot(T) in :Di~(T) members of which we call tight 
generab le .  
Theorem 12 Each light generable command rela- 
tion is an intersection of chains of light relations. 
3 In t roduc ing  Boo lean  Labe ls  
3.1 Boo lean  GrAmmars  
We are now providing means to define CRs uniformly 
over trees. The trees are assumed to be labelled. 
For mathematical convenience the labels are drawn 
from a boolean algebra ? = (L, 0, 1, - ,  n, U). A la- 
be l l ing  is a function ? : T ~ L. ? is called ful l  
if ~(z) is an atom of ? or 0 for every z. If either 
~(z) = a = 0or  0 < ?(x) < a we say that z i so f  
ca tegory  a. Labelled trees are generated by boolean 
grammars. Since syntax is abstracting away from 
actual words to word classes named each by its own 
syntactical label we may forget to discriminate be- 
tween the terminal labels with impunity. This allows 
to give all of them the unique value 0, which is now 
the only terminal, the non-terminals being all ele- 
ments of L - {0}. A boo lean  grammar  is defined 
as a triple 6 = (~, ~, R) where R is a finite subset 
of (L - {0}) x L + and ~ ? L - {0}. G generates  
T = (T,?) - in symbols G >> T - ,  if (r) r is of 
category ~, (t) x is of category 0 iff x is a leaf and 
(nt) if x immediately dominates Y l , . . . ,  Y- then with 
an appropriate order of the indices there is a rule 
a --* b t , . . . ,  b, in R such that x is of category a and 
Yl is of category bl for all i. Boolean grammars are a 
mild step away from context free grammars. Namely, 
if a --* bz . . .  bn is a boolean rule, we may consider it 
as an abbreviation of the set of rules a* --* b~ . . .  b~ 
where a* is an atom of ? below a and b~ is an atom 
of ? below bi for each i. Likewise, the start symbol 
abbreviates a set of start symbols ~*, which by fa- 
miliar tricks can be replaced by a single one denoted 
by R, which is added artificially. In this way we can 
translate G into a cfg O* over the set of atoms of ? 
plus 0 and the new start symbol R, which generates 
the same fully labelled trees - ignoring the deviant 
start symbol. It is known that there is an effective 
procedure to eliminate from a cfg labels that never 
occur in a finite tree generated by the grammar (see 
e. g. \[Harrison, 1978\]). This procedure can easily be 
adapted to boolean grammars. A boolean grammar 
without such superfluous ymbols is called normal .  
3.2 Domain  Specification 
Each boolean label a defines the relation of a- 
command on a fully labelled tree via the set of 
nodes of category a. This is the classical scenario; 
the label S defines S-command, the label NPU CP de- 
fines Lasnik's Kommand. And so forth. We denote 
the particular relation induced on (T,?) by 6T(a). 
~,From this basic set of tight CRs we allow to define 
more complex CRs using the operations. To do this 
we first define a constructor language that contains 
a constant a for each a E L and the binary sym- 
bols A, V and o. (Although we also use e, we will 
treat it as an abbreviation; also, this operation is de- 
fined only for tight relations.) Since we assume the 
equations of distributoids, the symbols a generate a
distributoid with A, V, o, namely the so-called f ree  
d i s t r ibuto id .  The map ~T can be extended to a 
homomorphism from this distributoid into :Diz(T). 
Simply put 
 T(VVe) = 6T( )O6T(e) 
o e) = o  T(e) 
By definition, the image of ~ under ~T is tight gen- 
erable. Hence ~v maps all nearness terms into tight 
generable relations. With N P U C P being 1-node sub- 
jaceny (for English) we find that (NPUCP)o(NPUCP) 
is 2-node subjacency. Using a more complex defini- 
tion it is possible to define 0- and 1-subjacency in 
the barriers system on the condition that there are 
no double segments of a category. If  we consider 
the power of subsystems of this language, e. g. rela- 
tions definable using only A etc. the following picture 
emerges. 
{o,^} 
/ 
{o} {v,^} 
{^} 
This follows mainly from Theorem 12 because the 
map ~ is by definition into the distributoid ",for(T) 
of tight generated CRs. Moreover, A alone does not 
create new CRs, because of Prop. 5. Each of the 
inclusions is proper as is not hard to see. So V does 
not add definitional strength in presence of o and A; 
244 
although things may be more perspicuously phrased 
using V it is in principle eliminable. By requiring 
CRs to be intersections of chains we would therefore 
not express a real restriction at all. 
3.3 The  Equat iona l  Theory  
Given a boolean grammar G, a tree T and two do- 
mains D, e constructed from the labels of G we write 
T ~ ~ = e if 6T(e) = 6T(e). The set 
Eq(O) - {B = I(VT << O)(T F= = ,)} 
is called the equat iona l  theory  of (3. To deter- 
mine the equational theory of a grammar we pro- 
ceed through a series of reductions. (3 admits the 
same finite trees as does is normal reduct G n. So, 
we might as well assume from start that (3 is nor- 
mal. Second, domains are insensitive to the branch- 
ing nature of rules. We can replace with impunity 
any rule p = a --, b l . . .b ,  by the set of rules 
pU = {a --* bili <_ n}. We can do this for all rules of 
the grammar. The grammar G ~ = (I3, 2, R ~) where 
R" = {p"\[p E R} is called the unary  reduct  o f  
G. It  has the same equational theory as G since the 
trees it generates are exactly the branches of tree 
generated by G. Next we reduce the unary grammar 
to an ordinary cfg G ~* in the way described above, 
with an artificially added start symbol R. This gram- 
mar is completely isomorphic to a transition etwork 
alias directed graph with single source R and single 
sink 0. This network is realized over the set of atoms 
of ? plus R and 0. There are only finitely many 
such networks over given E - to be exact, at most 
2 ("+!)~ (!) where n is the number of atoms of 2. 
Finally, it does not harm if we add some transitions 
from R and transitions to 0. First, if we do so, the 
equational theory must be included in the theory of 
G since we allow more structures to be generated. 
But it cannot be really smaller; we are anyway inter- 
ested in all substructures T z for nodes z, so adding 
transitions to 0 is of no effect. Moreover, adding 
transitions from R can only give more equations be- 
cause the generated trees of this new transition sys- 
tem are branches where some lower and some upper 
cone is cut off. Thus, rather than taking the gram- 
mar G u* we can take a grammar with some more 
rules, namely all transitions R --+ A, A --* 0 for an 
atom A plus R ---, 0. In all, the role of source and sink 
are completely emptied, and we might as well forget 
about them. What we keep to distinguish grammars 
is the directed graph on the atoms of ~ induced by 
the unary reduct of G. Let us denote this graph 
by Gpb(G). We have seen that if two grammars 
G, H have the same graph, their equational theory 
is the same. The converse also holds. To see this, 
take an atom A and let As ? be the disjunction of 
all atoms B such that B --, A is a transition in the 
graph (or, equivalently, in the unary reduct) of G. 
Then A o A e = A o J_ E Eq(G). However, if C ~ A e 
then A o C = A o _1_ ~ Eq(G). If O and H have dif- 
ferent graphs, then there must be an A such that 
A~ ? A~, that is, either A~ ~ A~ or A~ ~ A 8. 
Consequently, either A o A O - A o .L ~ Eq(H) or 
AoA~ -- Ao.L ? EKG ). 
Theorem 13 EKe,) = EKH) i ff = 
?pb(H). Hence it is decidable for any pair G, H o\]. 
boolean grammars over the same labels whether or 
not Eq(G) = Eq(H). m 
The question is now how we can decide whether a 
given domain equation holds in a grammar. We 
know by the reductions that we can assume this 
grammar to be unary. Now take an equation B - 
e. Suppose this equation is not in the theory and 
we have a countermodel. This countermodel is a 
non-branching labelled tree T a node z such that 
6T(~)): ~ 6T(?)~. Let Sf(~) denote the set of sub- 
formulas of ~ and Sf(e) the set of subformulas of ?. 
Put S = {f~(x)l 0 E Sf(~) U Sf(e)}. S is certainly 
finite and its cardinality is bounded by the sum of 
the cardinalities of Sf(~) and Sf(?). Now let y, z be 
two points from S such that y < z and for all u 
such that y< u<z  u~S.  Let ul andu2 be two 
points such that y < ul < us < z and such that 
ul and us have the same label. We construct a new 
labelled tree U by dropping all nodes from ul up un- 
til the node immediately below us. The following 
holds of the new model. (i) It is a tree generated by 
G and (ii) 6u(0)x ~ 6u(e)x. Namely, if w -< ul then 
?(ul) ---, ?(w) is a transition of G, hence ?(u2) --, t(w) 
is a transition of G as well because l (u l )  - ?(u2); and 
so (i) is proved. For (ii) it is enough to prove that 
for all ~ E Sf(D) 0 Sf(?) the value f~(z) in the new 
model is the same as the value fs(z)  in the old model. 
(Identification is possible, because these points have 
not been dropped.) This is done by reduction on 
the structure of g. Suppose then that 0 = IJ A 
and f~(z) -- fb(z) as well as f~(z) = fe(z); then 
f~(x) = min{f~(z), f~(z)} = min{fb(z),fe(z)} = 
fg(z). And similarly for g = b V ~. By the normal 
form theorem we can assume 0 to be a disjunction of 
conjunctions of chains, so by the previous reductions 
it remains to treat the case where g is a chain. Hence 
let i~ = dot .  We assume f ; (z)  -- re(x)----: y. Let 
z := f~(z). Then if y < r, y < z and else y = z. By 
construction, z is the first node above y to be of cat- 
egory a and z E S, by which z is not dropped. In the 
reduced model, z is again the first node of category 
a above y, and so f~(z) -- f~(y) = z, which had to 
be shown. 
Assume now that we have a tree of minimal size 
generated by G in which/~ = e does not hold. Then 
i fy,  z E S such that y < z but for no u E S y < u < 
z, then in between y and z all nodes have different 
labels. Thus, in between y and z sit no more points 
than there are atoms in ?. Let this number be n; 
then our model has size < n ? S. Now if we want to 
decide whether or not ~ = ? is in Eq(G), all we have 
to do is to first generate all possible branches of trees 
245 
of length at most n x (~Sf(O)+ ~Sf(c))+ 2 and check 
the equation on them. If it holds everywhere, then 
indeed 0 = e is valid in all trees because otherwise 
we would have found a countermodel of at most this 
size. 
Theorem 14 It is decidable whether or not ~ - ? E 
Eq(O). ? 
These theorems tell us that there is nothing dan- 
gerous in using domains in grammar as concerns the 
question whether the predictions made by this theory 
can effectively be computed; that is, as!ong as one 
sticks to the given format of domain constructions, 
it is decidable whether or not a given grammatical 
theory makes a certain prediction about domains. 
4 Implementations 
4.1 P rob lems of  Imp lementat ions  
The aim set by our theory is to reduce all possi- 
ble nearness conditions of grammar to some restric- 
tions involving command relations. Thus we treat 
not only binding theory or case theory but also re- 
strictions on movement. Even though \[Barker and 
Pullum, 1990\] did not think of movement and subja- 
cency as providing cases for command relations, the 
fact that nearness conditions are involved clearly in- 
dicates that the theory should have something to say 
about them. However, there are various obstacles to 
a direct implementation. 
The theory of command relations is not directly 
compatible with standard nearness relations in G8. 
A command relation as defined here depends in its 
size only of the isomorphism type of the linear struc- 
ture above the node z. So, typical definitions uch 
as those involving the notions of being governed, be- 
ing bound, having an accessible subject fail to be of 
the kind proposed here because they involve a node 
that stands in relation of c-command rather than 
domination. Nevertheless, if 6B would be spelt out 
fully into a boolean grammar, far more labels have 
to be used than appear usually on trees displayed 
in GB books. The reason is that while context-free 
grammars by definition allow no context o rule the 
structure of a local tree, in GB the whole tree is im- 
plicitly treated as a context. But if it is true that 
the context for a node reduces to nodes that are c- 
commanding, it is enough to add for certain prim- 
itive labels X another label QX which translates as 
one of my daughters is X. Here, QX is not necessar- 
ily understood to be a new label but a specific label 
that guarantees one of the daughters to be of cate- 
gory X. However, 'modals' such as Q are somewhat 
whimsical creatures. Sometimes, QX is an already 
existing category, for example Q|P can (with the ex- 
ception of exceptional case marking constructions) 
he equated with C'. On other occasions, however, we 
need to incorporate them into our grammar; promi- 
nent modals are SLASH : X, which has the meaning 
somewhere below me is a gap of category X and AGR 
: X which says this sentence has a subject of cate- 
gory X. If a context-free rendering of phrase struc- 
ture is done properly (as for example in \[Gazdar et 
aL, 1985\]) a single entry such as V must be split into 
a vast number of different symbols so we can rea- 
sonably assume that our grammar is rich enough to 
have all the QX for the X we need; otherwise they 
must be added artificially. In that case many of the 
standard nearness relations can be directly encoded 
using command relations. 
A second problem concerns the role of adjunction 
in the definition of subjacency. If the domain of 
movement for a node (that is, the domain within 
which the antecedent has to be found) is tight, then 
no iteration of movement leads to escaping the orig- 
inal domain. So, the domain for movement must 
be large. But it cannot be too large either be- 
cause we loose the necessity of free escape hatches 
(spec of comp, for example). The typical defini- 
tions of subjacency lead to domains that are just 
about right in size. However, the dilemma must be 
solved that after moving to spec of comp, an element 
can move higher than it could from its original po- 
sition. Different solutions have been offered. The 
most simple is standard 2-node subjacency which is 
KOMMAND o KOMMAND. This domain indeed allows 
this type of cyclical movement; cyclic movement from 
spec of comp to spec of comp is possible - but only 
to the next spec of comp. However, due to it's short- 
comings, this notion has been criticised; moreover, it
has been felt that 1-node subjacacency should be su- 
perior, largely because of the slogan 'grammar does 
not count'. Yet, tight domains don't do the jobs and 
so tricks have been invented. \[Chomsky, 1986\] for- 
mulated rather small domains but included a mecha- 
nism to escape them by creating 'grey zones' in which 
elements are neither properly dominated by a node 
nor in fact properly non-dominated. This idea has 
caught on (for example in \[Sternefeld, 1991\]) but has 
to be treated cautiously as even the simplest notions 
such as category, node etc. receive new interpreta- 
tions because nodes are not necessarily identical with 
occurrences of categories as before. A reduction to 
standard notions hould certainly be possible and de- 
sired - without necessarily banning adjunction. 
4.2 The  Koster  Mat r ix  
As \[Koster, 1986\] observed, grammatical relations 
are typically relations between a dependent element 
and an antecedent or:
I I 
R 
\[Koster, 1986\] notes four conditions on such configu- 
rations. 
a. obligatoriness 
246 
b. uniqueness of the antecedent 
c. c-command of the antecedent 
d. locality 
If these conditions are met then this relation has the 
effect 
share property 
This has to be understood as follows. (a.) and (b.) 
express nothing but that 6 needs one and only one 
antecedent. This antecedent, a must c-command 6. 
Finally, (d.) states that a must be found in some lo- 
cal domain of 6. Of course, this domain is language 
specific as well as specific to the syntactic onstruc- 
tion, i. e. the category of 6 and c~. Likewise, the 
property to be shared depends on the category of a 
and 6. 
The locality restriction expresses that a is found 
within the R-domain of 6. This relation R is in the 
unmarked case defined as follows. 
Def in i t ion  15 a is l oca l ly  access ib le  I to 6 if 
c~ <_ 1~, where fl is the least maximal projection con- 
taining 6 and a governor of 6. 
\[Koster, 1986\] assumes that greater domains are 
formed by licensed extensions. These extensions are 
marked constructions; while all languages agree on 
the local accessibility 1 as the minimal domain within 
which antecedents must be found, larger domains 
may also exist but their size is language and con- 
struction specific. Nevertheless, the variation is lim- 
ited. There are only three basic types, namely locally 
accessible i for i = 1, 2, 3. 
Def in i t ion 16 a is loca l ly  access ib le  2 to 6 if 
ot <_ ~, where 1~ is the least maximal projection con- 
taining 6, a governor for 6 and some opacity element 
w. a is loca l ly  access ib le  z to & if there is a se- 
quence ~i, 1 < n, such that \[31 is locally accessible 2 
from & and ~i+1 is locally accessible 2 from ~i. 
The opacity elements are drawn from a rather lim- 
ited list. Such elements are tense, mood etc. A 
well-known example are Icelandic reflexives whose 
domain is the smallest indicative sentence. 
4.3 The  Command Re lat ions  o f  Koster ' s  
Mat r ix  
The local accessibility relations certainly are com- 
mand relations in our sense. The real problem is 
whether they are definable using primitive labels of 
the grammar. In particular the recursiveness of the 
third accessibility makes it unlikely that we can find 
a definition in terms of A, V, o. Yet, if it were re- 
ally an arbitrary iteration of the second accessibil- 
ity relation it would be completely trivial, because 
any iteration of a command relation over a tree is 
the total relation over the tree. Hence, there must 
be something non-trivial about this domain; indeed, 
the iteration is stopped if the outer/~ is ungoverned. 
This is the key to a non-iterative definition of the 
third accessibility relation. 
Let us assume for simplicity that there is a single 
type of governors denoted by GOV and that there 
is a single type of opacity element denoted by OP.Y, 
The first hurdle is the clarification of government. 
Normally, government requires a governing element, 
i.e. an element of category GOV that is close in some 
sense. How close, is not clarified in \[Koster, 1986\]. 
Clearly, by penalty of providing circular definitions, 
closeness cannot be accessibility1; really, it must be 
an even smaller domain. Let us assume for simplicity 
that it is sisterhood. If then we introduce the modal 
tX to denote one of my sisters is of category X, being 
governed is equal to being of category tGOV. Like- 
wise we will assume that the opacity element must 
be in c-command relation to 6. We are now ready 
to define the three accessibility relations, which we 
denote by LA 1, LA 2 and LA 3. 
LA 1 = ?GOV* BAR:2 
AQGOV o BAR:2 
LA z = ?GOV* ?OPY?  BAR:2 
A?GOV ? QOPY o BAR:2 
A?GOV o QOPY ? BAR:2 
A?GOV o QOPY o BAR:2 
LA s = ?GOV ? QOPY ? BAR:2 ?-IIGOV 
A(~GOV ? (~OPY o BAR:2 ? -tGOV 
A?GOV o ~OPY ? BAR:2 ? -tGOV 
A?GOV o ?OPY o BAR:2 ? -tlGOV 
(Observe that ? binds stronger than o.) For a proof 
consider a point z of a labelled tree T. Let g denote 
the smallest node dominating both x and its governor 
and let m be the smallest maximal projection of 9. 
Then x < g _< m. So two cases arise, namely g = m 
and g < rn. In each cases LA 1 picks the right node. 
Likewise, if o denotes the smallest element containing 
x and a opacity element hat c-commands z, then 
x < o. Three cases are conceivable, o < g, o = g and 
o > g. However, if government can take place only 
under sisterhood, o < g cannot occur. So x < g _< 
o < m. For each of the four cases LA 2 picks the right 
node. Finally, for LA s there is an extra condition on 
m that it be ungoverned. 
Notice that our translation is faithful to Koster's 
definitions only if the domains defined in \[Koster, 
1986\] are monotone. This is by no means triv- 
ial. Namely, it is conceivable that a node has an 
ungoverned element y locally accessible 2, while the 
highest locally accessible 2 node, z, is governed. In 
that case (ignoring the opacity element for a mo- 
ment) the domain of local accessibility 3 of y is z while 
the domain of z is strictly larger. We find no answer 
to this puzzle in the book because the domains are 
defined only for governed elements. But it seems cer- 
tain that the monotone definition given here is the 
intended one. 
It should be stressed that GOV and OPY are not 
specific labels but variables. Their value may change 
from situation to situation. Consequently, the local 
accessibility relations are parametrized with respect 
to the choice of particular governors and particular 
247 
opacity elements. As an example, recall the Icelandic 
case again, where certain anaphors whose domain of 
accessibility 2 (typically the clause) can be extended 
in case the opacity element is subjunctive. Following 
our reduction, the domain of local accessibility 3 is 
defined by the first maximal projection that is not 
subjunctive, hence indicative. We take a primitive 
label IND to stand for is indicative. So, for Icelandic 
we have the following special domain 
LA 3 = (~GOV, ~)IND, BAR:2 ,-tGOV 
AQGOV ? QIND o BAR:2 ?-~GOV 
A~)GOV o QIND ? BAR:2 ? -I:IGOV 
AQGOV o QIND o BAR:2 ?-bGOV 
We notice in passing that recent results have put 
this analysis into doubt (see \[Koster and Reuland, 
1991\]) but this is a problem of Koster's original def- 
initions, not of this translation. What is a problem, 
however, is the standard opacity factor of an acces- 
sible subject. While subject (or even SUBJEC~ can 
be easily handled with a boolean label, the acces- 
sibility condition presents real difficulties. First of 
all it involves indexing and indexes potentially de- 
stroy the finiteness of the labelling system; secondly, 
it is not clear how the accessibility condition (namely, 
the reqirement that the i/i-Filter is respected after 
conindexation) can be handled at all in this calculus. 
This issue is too complex to be tackled here, so we 
leave it for another occasion. 
4.4 Trans la t ing  Koster ' s  Mat r ix  into  Rules  
In a final step we show how the nearness conditions 
of the Koster Matrix can be rewritten into rules of a 
context-free grammar. To be more precise, we show 
how they can be implemented into any given boolean 
cfg. The booleanness, of course, is not essential but 
is here for convenience. We noticed earlier that the 
domains in cB really are for the purpose of introduc- 
ing some limited forms of context-sensitivity. If two 
nodes relate via some dependency relation R then 
Koster assumes that a certain property is shared. 
But context-free grammars do in principle not allow 
such a sharing except between mother and daughters 
and between sister nodes. Nevertheless, as we do not 
require all properties to be shared but only some it 
is possible to enrich the grammar in such a way that 
nodes receive relevant information about parts of the 
structure that normally cannot be accessed. We will 
show how. 
First, we will assume that share property is to be 
understood as a dependency in the labellings be- 
tween two elements. We simplify this by assum- 
ing that there are special features PRPi, i < n, of 
unspecified nature whose instantiation at the two 
nodes, 6 and a, is somehow correlated. Since the 
dependent element is structurally lower than the an- 
tecedent, and since generation in cfg's is top to bot- 
tom, we assume that it is the dependent element that 
has to set the PRPI according to the way they are 
set at the antecedent. The best way to implement 
this is by a function f that for every assignment prp 
of the primitive labels at the antecedents gives the 
labelling f(prp) which the dependent element must 
satisfy. In order to be able to achieve this correla- 
tion in a context-free grammar, the dependent ele- 
ment needs to know in which way the atoms PRPi 
have been set at a. Thus the problem reduces to a 
transfer of information from ct to 6. If we generate 
only fully labelled trees the problem is precisely to 
transfer n bits of information from tr to 6. The con- 
tent of this information is of course irrelevant for the 
formalization. 
To begin with, we need to be able to recognize 
antecedent and dependent element by their category. 
We do this here by taking two labels ANT and DEP 
with obvious meaning. Furthermore, one of our tasks 
is to ensure that the labels X and IX are correctly 
distributed. Notice, by the way, that it is only for 
special choices of X that we need these composite 
elements, so there is nothing recursive or infinite in 
this procedure. For the sake of simplicity we assume 
the grammar to be in Chomsky Normal Form; that 
is, we only have rules ot type X ---* YZ, X --~ Y, X ---* 0 
for X, Y and Z atoms or = R (see \[Harrison, 1978\]). 
For any rule p = A ---, BC and any X we distribute 
the new labels QX and tX as follows. If B _< X but 
C ~ X then we replace p by 
Anox 
B n-~n ~x 
However, if C < X but B :~ X then we use this rule 
Anex  
B n '~n 4x 
It is clear what we do if both B, C < X. If neither 
is the case, however, we have this rule 
An-OX 
B 
Likewise the unary rules are expanded. Here, we 
have either B _< X (left) or B ~ X (right). 
AA?X AA-?X 
ol x 
248 
After having inserted enough ~X and ~X we can 
proceed to the domains of accessibility. The general 
problem is as said above, the transfer of information 
from a to &. The problem is attacked by introduc- 
ing more modal elements. Namely, for certain g and 
certain labels X we introduce the new label (g)X. Its 
interpretation is an element of label X is in my g- 
domain and neither do I dominate it nor am I dom- 
inated by it. If we succeed in distributing these new 
labels according to their intended interpretation we 
can code the Koster Matrix into the grammar. We 
show the encoding for (F)V. It is then more or less 
evident how (9)X is encoded for a chain g because 
(b o F)X = (b)(F)X, just as in modal logic. Now for 
(F)Y there are two cases. (i) The mother node is of 
category (F)Yn-F. Then the information (F)Y must 
be passed on to all daughters. (ii) The mother is 
of category -(F)Y U F. Then a daughter is (F)Y if 
and only if it has a sister of category Y. Thus at all 
daughters we simply instantiate (F)Y ~ ~Y. 
It should be quite clear that by a suitable choice 
of (g)X to be added a dependent element 6 will have 
access to the information that it has an antecedent in
its domain of local accessibility i. If it needs to know 
what category this antecedent has, this information 
has to be supplied in tandem with the mere prop- 
erty that needs to be shared. One snag remains; 
namely, it may happen that there are more than 
one antecedent of required type. In that case we 
need to manipulate the rules of the grammar as fol- 
lows. As long as we have an element of category 
ANT we suppress any other antecedents of category 
ANT within the same domain. This might be not 
entirely straightforward, but to keep matters imple 
here we assume that the grammar takes care of that. 
We show now how the translation is completed. For 
accessibility z we add the following boolean axiom to 
the grammar (that is, we 'kill' all rules that do not 
comply with this axiom): 
(BAR:2)(ANT f'1 prp) 13 I;IGOV lq DEP. --* .f(prp) 
By choice of the interpretation, this axiom declares 
that a node which is governed and dependent and has 
an anetecdent within the next maximal projection 
must be of category f(prp) if its (unique) antecedent 
is of category prp. The uniqueness i assumed here 
to be guaranteed by the grammar into which we en- 
code. Furthermore, note that the assumption that 
government takes place under sisterhood results in 
a significant simplification. Limitations of space for- 
bid us to treat the more general case, however. For 
accessibility 2 this axiom is added instead 
COPY o BAR:2 A OPY ? BAR:2)(ANT n prp) 
n~GOV n DEP. --~ .f(prp) 
Finally, for accessibility 3, we have to replace BAR:2 
by BAR:217-hGOV. 
More details can be found in \[Kracht, 1993\]. The 
upshot of this is the following. Suppose that a gram- 
mar of some language consists of a basic generative 
component in form of a cfg 13 and a number of Koster 
Matrices as additional constraints on the structures. 
If the number of matrices is finite, then finitely many 
additional labels suffice to create a cfg G + from the 
original grammar that guarantess that it's output 
trees satisfy the local conditions of 13 as well as the 
nearness conditions imposed by the Koster Matri- 
ces. Upper bounds on the number of labels of G + 
(depending both on (3 and the additional matrices) 
can be computed as well.
