Abstract 
This paper proposes a novel user intention si-
mulation method which is a data-driven ap-
proach but able to integrate diverse user dis-
course knowledge together to simulate various 
type of users. In Markov logic framework, lo-
gistic regression based data-driven user inten-
tion modeling is introduced, and human dialog 
knowledge are designed into two layers such 
as domain and discourse knowledge, then it is 
integrated with the data-driven model in gen-
eration time. Cooperative, corrective and self-
directing discourse knowledge are designed 
and integrated to mimic such type of users. 
Experiments were carried out to investigate 
the patterns of simulated users, and it turned 
out that our approach was successful to gener-
ate user intention patterns which are not only 
unseen in the training corpus and but also per-
sonalized in the designed direction.  
1 Introduction 
User simulation techniques are widely used for learn-
ing optimal dialog strategies in a statistical dialog 
management framework and for automated evaluation 
of spoken dialog systems. User simulation can be 
layered into the user intention level and user surface 
(utterance) level. This paper proposes a novel inten-
tion level user simulation technique.  
In recent years, a data-driven user intention model-
ing is widely used since it is domain- and language 
independent. However, the problem of data-driven 
user intention simulation is the limitation of user pat-
terns. Usually, the response patterns from data-driven 
simulated user tend to be limited to the training data. 
Therefore, it is not easy to simulate unseen user inten-
tion patterns, which is quite important to evaluate or 
learn optimal dialog policies. Another problem is poor 
user type controllability in a data-driven method. 
Sometimes, developers need to switch testers between 
various type of users such as cooperative, uncoopera-
tive or novice user and so on to expose their dialog 
system to various users. 
For this, we introduce a novel data-driven user in-
tention simulation method which is powered by hu-
man dialog knowledge in Markov logic formulation 
(Richardson and Domingos, 2006) to add diversity 
and controllability to data-driven intention simulation. 
2 Related work 
Data-driven intention modeling approach uses statis-
tical methods to generate the user intention given dis-
course information (history). The advantage of this 
approach lies in its simplicity and in that it is domain- 
and language independency. N-gram based approach-
es (Eckert et al, 1997, Levin et al, 2000) and other 
approaches (Scheffler and Young, 2001, Pietquin and 
Dutoit, 2006, Schatzmann et al, 2007) are  introduced. 
There has been some work on combining rules with 
statistical models especially for system side dialog 
management (Heeman, 2007, Henderson et al, 2008). 
However, little prior research has tried to use both 
knowledge and data-driven methods together in a sin-
gle framework especially for user intention simulation.  
In this research, we introduce a novel data-driven 
user intention modeling technique which can be di-
versified or personalized by integrating human dis-
course knowledge which is represented in first-order 
logic in a single framework. In the framework, di-
verse type of user knowledge can be easily designed 
and selectively integrated into data-driven user inten-
tion simulation. 
3 Overall architecture  
The overall architecture of our user simulator is 
shown in Fig. 1. The user intention simulator accepts 
the discourse circumstances with system intention as 
input and generates the next user intention. The user 
utterance simulator constructs a corresponding user 
sentence to express the given user intention. The si-
mulated user sentence is fed to the automatic speech 
recognition (ASR) channel simulator, which then adds 
noises to the utterance. The noisy utterance is passed 
to a dialog system which consists of spoken language 
understanding (SLU) and dialog management (DM) 
modules. In this research, the user utterance simulator 
and ASR channel simulator are developed using the 
method of  (Jung et al, 2009).

4 Markov logic 
Markov logic is a probabilistic extension of finite 
first-order logic (Richardson and Domingos, 2006). A 
Markov Logic Network (MLN) combines first-order 
logic and probabilistic graphical models in a single 
representation.  
An MLN can be viewed as a template for construct-
ing Markov networks. From the above definition, the 
probability distribution over possible worlds x speci-
fied by the ground Markov network is given by  
 
 
 
where F is the number  of formulas in the MLN and 
ni(x) is the number of true groundings of Fi in x. As 
formula weights increase, an MLN increasingly re-
sembles a purely logical KB, becoming equivalent to 
one in the limit of all infinite weights. General algo-
rithms for inference and learning in Markov logic are 
discussed in (Richardson and Domingos, 2006). 
Since Markov logic is a first-order knowledge base 
with a weight attached to each formula, it provides a 
theoretically fine framework integrating a statistically 
learned model with logically designed and inducted 
human knowledge. So the framework can be used for 
building up a hybrid user modeling with the advan-
tages of knowledge-based and data-driven models.  
5 User intention modeling in Markov 
logic 
The task of user intention simulation is to generate 
subsequent user intentions given current discourse 
circumstances. Therefore, user intention simulation 
can be formulated in the probabilistic form 
P(userIntention | context).  
In this research, we define the user intention state 
userIntention = [dialog_act, main_goal, compo-
nent_slot], where dialog_act is a domain-independent 
label of an utterance at the level of illocutionary force 
(e.g. statement, request, wh_question) and main_goal 
is the domain-specific user goal of an utterance (e.g. 
give_something, tell_purpose). Component slots 
represent domain-specific named-entities in the utter-
ance. For example, in the user intention state for the 
utterance ?I want to go to city hall? (Fig. 2), the com-
bination of each slot of semantic frame represents the 
user intention symbol. In this example, the state sym-
bol is ?request+search_loc+[loc_name]?. Dialogs on 
car navigation deal with support for the information 
and selection of the desired destination. 
The first-order language-based predicates which 
are related with discourse context information and 
with generating the next user intention are as follows: 
 
For example, after the following fragment of dialog 
for the car navigation domain,  
 
the discourse context which is passed to the user si-
mulator is illustrated in Fig. 3. 
Notice that the context information is composed of 
semantic frame (SF), discourse history (DH) and pre-
vious system intention (SI). ?isFilledComponent? 
predicate indicates which component slots are filled 
during the discourse.  ?updatedEntity? predicate is 
true if the corresponding named entity is newly up-
dated. ?hasSystemAct? and ?hasSystemActAttr? 
predicate represent previous system intention and 
mentioned attributes.

5.1 Data-driven user intention modeling in 
Markov logic 
The formulas are defined between the predicates 
which are related with discourse context information 
and corresponding user intention. The formulas for 
user intention modeling based on logistic regression 
are as follows: 
?ct, pui, ui hasIntention(ct, pui)1   
=>  GenerateUserIntention(ct, ui) 
?ct, da, ui hasDialogAct(ct, da) => GenerateUserIntention(ct,ui) 
?ct, mg, ui hasMainGoal(ct, mg) => GenerateUserIntention(ct,ui) 
?ct, en, ui hasEntity(ct, en) =>GenerateUserIntention(ct,ui) 
?ct, en, ui isFilledComponent(ct,en) 
=> GenerateUserIntention(ct,ui)  
?ct, en, ui updatedEntity(ct, en) => GenerateUserIntention(ct,ui) 
?ct, dbr, ui hasNumDBResult(ct, dbr)  
=> GenerateUserIntention(ct, ui) 
?ct, sa, ui hasSystemAct(ct, sa) =>GenerateUserIntention(ct, ui) 
?ct, attr, ui hasSystemActAttr(ct, attr) 
       =>  GenerateUserIntention(ct, ui) 
The weights of each formula are estimated from 
the data which contains the evidence (context) and 
corresponding user intention of next turn (userInten-
tion). 
5.2 User knowledge 
In this research, the user knowledge, which is used for 
deciding user intention given discourse context, is 
layered into two levels: domain knowledge and dis-
course knowledge. Domain- specific and ?dependent 
knowledge is described in domain knowledge. Dis-
course knowledge is more general and abstracted 
knowledge. It uses the domain knowledge as base 
knowledge. The subtask which is one of domain 
knowledge are defined as follows 
 
?isSubTask? implies which subtask corresponds 
to the current context. ?subTaskHasIntention? 
describes which subtask has which user intention. 
?moveTo? predicate implies the connection from sub-
task to subtask node. 
Cooperative, corrective and self-directing discourse 
knowledge is represented in Markov logic to mimic 
following users.  
? Cooperative User: A user who is cooperative with a 
system by answering what the system asked.  
? Corrective User: A user who try to correct the mis-
behavior of system by jumping to or repeating spe-
cific subtask. 
? Self-directing User: A user who tries to say what 
he/she want to without considering system?s sugges-
tion.  
Examples of discourse knowledge description for 
three types of user are shown in Fig. 4. 
                                                 
1 ct: context, ui: user intention, pui: previous user intention, da: 
dialog act, mg: main goal, en: entity, dbr:DB result, sa: system 
action, attr: target attribute of system action 
Both the formulas from data-driven model and 
formulas from discourse knowledge are used for con-
structing MLN in generation time. 
In inference, the discourse context related predi-
cates are given to MLN as true, then probabilities of 
predicate ?GenerateUserIntention? over candi-
date user intention are calculated. One of example 
evidence predicates was shown in Fig. 3. All of the 
predicates of Fig. 3 are given to MLN as true. From 
the network, the probability of P(userIntention | con-
text) is calculated. 
 
 
6 Experiments 
137 dialog examples from a real user and a dialog 
system in the car navigation domain were used to 
train the data-driven user intention simulator. The 
SLU and DM are built in the same way of (Jung et al, 
2009). After the training, simulations collected 1000 
dialog samples at each word error rate (WER) setting 
(WER=0 to 40%). The simulator model can be varied 
according to the combination of knowledge. We can 
generate eight different simulated users from A to H 
as Fig. 5. 
The overall trend of simulated dialogs are ex-
amined by defining an average score function similar 
to the reward score commonly used in reinforcement 
learning-based dialog systems for measuring both a 
cost and task success. We give 20 points for the suc-
cessful dialog state and penalize 1 point for each ac-
tion performed by the user to penalize longer dialogs.

Fig. 6 shows that simulated user C which has cor-
rective knowledge with statistical model show signifi-
cantly different trend over the most of word error rate 
settings. For the cooperative user (B), the difference is 
not as large and not statistically significant. It can be 
analyzed that the cooperative user behaviors are rela-
tively common patterns in human-machine dialog 
corpus. So, these behaviors can be already learned in 
statistical model (A).  
Using more than two type of knowledge together 
shows interesting result. Using cooperative know-
ledge with corrective knowledge together (E) shows 
much different result than using each knowledge 
alone (B and C). In the case of using self-directing 
knowledge with cooperative knowledge (F), the aver-
age scores are partially increased against base line 
scores. However, using corrective knowledge with 
self-directing knowledge does not show different re-
sult.  It can be thought that the corrective knowledge 
and self-directing knowledge are working as contra-
dictory policy in deciding user intention. Three dis-
course knowledge combined user shows very interest-
ing result. H shows much higher improvement over 
all simulated users, and the differences are significant 
results at p ? 0.001.  
To verify the proposed user simulation method can 
simulate the unseen events, the unseen rates of units 
were calculated. Fig. 7 shows the unseen unit rates of 
intention sequence. The unseen rate of n-gram varies 
according to the simulated user. Notice that simulated 
user C, E and H generates higher unseen n-gram pat-
terns over all word error settings. These users com-
monly have corrective knowledge, and the patterns 
seem to not be present in the corpus. But the unseen 
patterns do not mean poor intention simulation. High-
er task completion rate of C, E and H imply that these 
users actually generate corrective user response to 
make a successful conversation. 
7 Conclusion 
This paper presented a novel user intention simulation 
method which is a data-driven approach but able to 
integrate diverse user discourse knowledge together to 
simulate various type of user.  A logistic regression 
model is used for the statistical user intention model 
in Markov logic. Human dialog knowledge is sepa-
rated into domain and discourse knowledge, and co-
operative, corrective and self-directing discourse 
knowledge are designed to mimic such type user. The 
experiment results show that the proposed user inten-
tion simulation framework actually generates natural 
and diverse user intention patterns what the developer 
intended.
