For t~xamtlh'., SUl)pose thai: we have the follow- 
ing SCllt(HICCS.

conclude t:hc preflwred rc~uling a.~ f'olh)ws. 
From dm above sentences. "He" wouhl be equal

a telescope at the time of seeing a ma.n fi:om |;he

from this prefl:rrcd re;~(ting, we conchuh', that the 
telescope is used as a, (levi(:(; to sec a man. 
However, this re;~ding is not tinal since at least 
the fl)llowing prcfl'~rences are involved in the above 
reading and these preferences Call be (teib.~ted 1)y

we need other reasoning met;hods rout in f~(:t, 
901 
many researches h;tve been using general reason- 
inn f~am(:works in Artificial Intelligence. such a,s 
abduction (ttobbs et al, 1993), prol)abilistic net- 
work (Chm'niak and Gohhnan, 1989), truth lnain- 
t(mance system (Zernik and Brown, 1988), default 
logic (Quantz, 1993) and conditional ogic (Las- 
carides, 1993). In this paper, wc ttropose another 
alternative, that is, circ,,.m.~cription (McCarthy, 
1986: Lifschitz, 1985). Even though circumscrit)- 
tion is one of the most pottular fornlMisn,s in the 
COllllllllllit, y of llOlllllOllOtOlliC reasoning rcs(,.ar(:h, 
it is surprishlg that w'.ry few h~ts examined feasi- 
bility of (:ircumscrit)tion for disa, mbiguation. Our 
work of disambiguation by intcrt)retation ordering 
is originated from (Satoh, 1991) and in a more 
recent work, Kameymna (Kameyama, 1994) has 
indcp(mdently propos('.d usage of circumscription 
for interpretation of pronominal anaphora. 
In this paper, we explore this direction fur- 
ther. In circumscription, we give a prefcrclme o f  
der over logical interpretations and consid('.r the 
most 1)referable models. This representation natu- 
rally corrcst)onds with a disambiguation task sin(w. 
we can regard a logical interpr(~tation as a possi- 
ble remling, and disaml)igua, tion as a, task to get 
the most prcf(wal)h; reading among possil)le read- 
lags. Among variants of circumscription, priori- 
tizcd circu.mscriptio'n, is suitable to ret)rcsent vari- 
ous strength of preference rules. In f)rioritized <fir- 
cumscril)tion, we can (livide preference rules into 
hiernrchy and this hierarchy giv(,,s a t)riority rela- 
tion ov(,.r pr(~f('.rences. Therefore, we directly rep- 
resent rules in the hierarchy in prioritized circum- 
sccil)tion. 
We believe, that circumscritttion has the follow- 
ing allvantage, s in the (:ask of resolving ambiguity. 
? Since wc use a tirst-order predicate calculus for 
a basic language, we (:all rot)resent various kinds 
of inforln;ttion such as grammaticsfl rules and se- 
mantical rules in one Damework. 
? There is only one extra underlying mc(:hanism 
besides iufi'.rellC(', rules for the first-order predicate 
cah:ulus, that; is, introducing an order over h)gical 
interltretations. Therefore, re.asoning process (:an 
be un(hwstoo(l easily COlnt)ared to other lnecha- 
llisln using numerical reasoning or comt)h:x infer- 
ca(:(; rules. 
? We (lo not nec(l to assign detailed mlmcri(:al val- 
ues to t)referellce rules in ord(;r to express t)riority 
over t)r(~ference rules, but just specify a t)ref(:rence 
level of the rules. This representation can t)e re- 
gar(led as all assignment of qualitative strength 
for 1)ref(~l'ell(;(~ rules all(\[ reduces a \])ur(letl of tel)- 
resenting a ttriority over preference rules gready. 
Moreover, this prioritization is general since we 
can repr(~sent a various kind of priority besides 
specilicity. 
? It is important to retain 1)ossible readings if we 
can not w.solve aml)iguity yet. In cir(:umscrip- 
Lion, we can consider multiple preferable models, 
not nec(;ssary the single pr@rable model. So, if 
ther(~ are yet multiple possible readings as a re- 
sult of disambiguation, we can keep these possit)le 
readings as multiple i)retb.rat/le lnodels. 
In this l)aper, we also dis(:uss an implenmn- 
ration by using hierarchical constraint logic pro- 
gramlning (HCLP) language sltch as (Borning ct 
al., 1989). HCLP language is similar to constraint 
h)gic progralnming bmguage except that we (;nil 
represent a constraint hierm:dly. Thus, there is 
a corrcst/on(lencc l/ctwecn a solution of an HCLP 
language and the most t)rcferablc models of pri- 
oritized circunmcription. Ill this patter, we use 
our HCLP language based on a l)oolean constraint 
solver to get tlJ(', most t)rcferal)lc models from t)ref -
er(mce rules rot)resented as bo(/h,,mt constraints in 
tlt(', HC'L1 ) language. Wc demonstrate how the. 
;fi)ove example of the disalnbiguation is tre;~ted in 
tlm HCLP language. 
2 Prioritized Circumscription 
In this section, we briefly review prioritized cir- 
cmnscritltion. For simI)licity sake, we modify the 
definition of prioritize(l circumscril)tiol, by (Mc- 
Carthy, 1986; Lifschitz, 1985). The difference is 
that we let al t)rcdical;es vary and lnaximize pref- 
erence rules whereas Lifschitz mininfize abnormal 
predicates for prefercnc(', rlth~s. 
Let cI)(x) and ~P(x) be formulas with th(! same 
nulnller of fre(~ w,.riables x. We say (,hat ?) and ~P 
are similar. ?1) > ~I/ stands for Vx(~II(x) D (P(x)). 
We extend this notation to tuples of formubm ep, ~IJ 
wllQFC (I) 22: {\[)\[ . . . .  {~,f,, alld ~1 / = @1 ..... ~\[,'., all(l 
and ~ are similar (each (I)j and @5 ~tre similar): 
(D > ~1) stands for A<' _ .~::~(I'j > ~Pj. We also write 
i1)> ~PA~P >(l) asCD =9 and 4)>~PA~(qJ_> (It) 
as ~P > ~P. 
Let a tuph', of formulas 4) be broken into disjoillt 
parts q51 , (1)2 .... , (1)a:. Let ~Iri be similar to 4;< We 
(te~ll('. q* ~ ~ d,Q" t, (A i .1 (\[~j = @.i ~ i  
=:  A'i::Iv j--1 D ~ / ) i t .  
We also wril;e (1) ~ vii A ~(~It _ ~I)) as ? ~ iP. 
Def in i t ion  1 Let A(P)  be a formula, and (D(P) 
be a tuple of formulas wh, ich, is brokcn into 
4 i l (P ) ,4 ,2 (P )  ..... (1)~:(P) where P is a, tv, ple of 
predicates used in these formulas. 
The ,~ynl, act, ic d@',nition of prioritized circum- 
scription i.s as follow.s: 
A(P)  A -~p(A(p)  A 47(p) >- ~(P) ) ,  (1)

1. p i.s a, t'uplc of predicate variabh',s ca, oh, of 
wh, ich, ha,s the same arity as th, e correspond- 
ing predicate constant in P,  
2, A(p)((D(p)) is a formula obtained b!l replac- 
ing evcry occurrence, in A(4L respectively) of 
a predicate con.st(m,t in P by the, correspond- 
infl predicate varia, ble in p.

imtt ing stronger preferences into a stronger hier- 
archy of l)references. 
For example, consider the following two gram- 
mar i ta l  preferences. 
1. If "He" appears in a sellteltce as the subject  
and the subject  in the previous sentence is 
male, then it is 1)referal)le that  "He" refers 
to the previous subject. 
2. If "He" appears in a sentence as the subject 
~tnd someone in the previous entence is male, 
then it is preferable that  "He" refers to the 
one in the t)revious sentence. 
Suppose that the former is stronger than the lat- 
ter. This pr ior i ty of the t)references means that 
the formula: 
(isa(a, Male) A subj(i, a) 
Ain~th, e_sentence(i + 1, He)) D eq(a, He)(3) 
shouht be satisfied as much as possible for every 
a and i, and if it is maximal ly  satisfied then the 
following forinnla: 
( isa( a, Male) A in_the_sentence(i, a) 
Ain_thc_sentcnce(i + 1, He)) D eq(a, He) (4) 
shouhl be satisfied as much as possible for every 
a and i. 
We can represent semantic preferences as well. 
For exalnple, a preference "If al  sees a2, then a2 
and al are not equal" means that the following 
expression shouhl be satisfied as nmch ~s possible 
for (;very e, (t,1 and a2: 
(act(e, See)A actor(e, a,1)A object(e, az)) D (5) 
=eq(a2, a,1 ) 
Note that the Mmw; is a preference rule because 
there is a possibi l i ty of reflexive use of "see". 
3.3 Example  
Now, we are ready to treat d isamhiguat ion of the 
sentences used in Section 1 by priorit ized circum- 
scription. 
We consider the following l)ackground knowl- 
edge which is always true. We denote the con- 
junct ions of the following ;~ioms as A0(P)  where 
p d~.f (eq, is, time, act, actor, object, 
recipient, device, sub j, in_the_sentence). 
1. If al  is equal to a2 then a2 is eqnM to az. 
ValVa2(eq(al, a2) D eq(a2, al)) 
2. If al and o,2 are equal and a2 and aa are 
equal, then al  and a3 are equal.

3. if al  is equM to a2, then a2 is an actor of a l ' s  
action, too.

5. If al  has o at t ime i, and al is not equal to 
a2, then a2 does not have o at t ime i. 
This is same as (2). 
We consider the following preferences. 
1. If ax sees a2, then ax and a2 are not equM. 
? (P, e, =(5) 
2. If a is lnale and a is the snbject  of i - th sen- 
tence and "He" is in the next sentence, then 
a is equal to :'He". 
? 2(P, e, a , i )  =(3) 
3. If a is rome and a is in i-t l l  sentence and 
"He" is in the next sentence, then a is equM 
to "He". 
?Pa (P,  a, i) =(4)  
4. If someone gives o to a at t ime i, then a has 
o at t ime i + 1. This expresses inert ia of 
ownership. 
= 
(act(e, Give) A object(e, o) 
Arecipient(e, a) A time(e, i)) D 
?e I (act(el ,  Have) A actor(q, a) 
Aobjeet(el, o) A t ime(e l , i  + 1)) 
5. If" a buys o at tinle i, then a has o at t ime 
i + 2. This preference of another inert ia of 
ownership is weaker than the former prefer- 
ence 1)ecause time interval is longer than the 
fornler t)reference. 
/b~(P, e, a,o,  i) = 
(act(e, B,,v) A actor(e, a) 
Aobject(e, o) A time(e., i)) D

Aobject(e~, o) A t ime(ca,  i + 2)) 
We assmne that ~ is a formula which should; be 
satisfied in the first place, O~ in the second place, 
(pa ~in the third place, q54 in the fourth place and 
? ) in the fifth place. 
Example  1 We con.sider the following sentences. 
J ohn  just  saw a man wi th  a te lescope.  
He bought  the te lescope yesterday.

NoLe thaL we represent "just" as Lime 2 and "yes- 
terday'" a.s time 0. 
In t, he synLa(:tic deiinil;ion of the lliOSl; prefer- 
M,le reading (I), we let A(P)  be &(P)A  At(P)  
and /~: I)e 5. 
We show an intuitive ext)l;ulation of inferen(:e of 
geLLing tl,e most t)referM)le reading as \[i)llows. 
F'rom the preference 2, "lie" preferably refers t,() 
,lohn. NoLe LhaL although t, he t)reference 3 seems 
Lo l)e alq)li(:able, iL is noL acLually used since the 
stronger prefcre, nce 2 overrides Lhe preferen(:c 3. 
Thell, from Lhe preference 5, John had l;he tele- 
scope el: Lime 2. Frolll Lhe t)reference l, .lohn is not 
equM to the, mau. Then, the man (:aunol: have l:he 
Leles(:ope, at Lime 2 front l;he l)a(:kground knowl- 
edge 5 and l;herefore, t;he t:eh;seope was used as a

l,ua.lly prove tha, t &:vice(l':l,telescop(:) is l,rue in

Example  2 Suppose we add the following sen- 
/once t,o the p'rcvious scnl, e'n, ces. 
But ,  he gave the  te lescope  to  the  man 
this  morn ing .  
A logi(:al representation relate(t I;o this Sclll;ence is 
as follows. We denot;e the fornml;t as A~(P). 
t,i', 1,,?" (I'23, \]) A (l, dl;,( E3, (-~i',,e) A acl:or(\],':~, l\] e ) 
Aobjcct( \]'\]3, Telescope) A recipient( Ea, Man)  
Note thai; we represent %his morning" a.s time 1. 
In l;his case, we h;t a(P) be A0(P) A A~(P) A 
A2(P) in the synta(:t:ie definil;ion. The, u, reading 
of "'widl ~t t;elescol)e" is (:hanged. From l:he pret: 
erence 4, Lhe 1,H-Ln shouhl have had Lhe l;eles(:ot)e

vice el; dnle 2, John wouhl Mso have Lhe Leles(:ot)e

edge 4 and it (:ontradiets background knowledge 5. 
Then, the weaker t)referen(-c 5 is rel;r~cl,ed Lo ~woid

vived. Therefore, in l;he mosL t)refera,1)le rea,ding,

4 HCLP language 
Now. we discuss an imt)lementation of priori- 
tized (:iv(:ulns(:ritfl:ion by IICI~P. FirsLly, we briefly 
review ~t hi(,r;Lrchi(:M consLrainL logic l)rogr~ttn - 
ming(HCM )) language. We follow t.he definition 
of (l~orning el; M., 1989). 
An HCI,I ) program consisLs of rules of (;lie form: 
h: -b l  .. . . .  b.., 
where h is a predicat, e and each of hi ..... b,,, is a 
predicate or a constraint or a 1M)eled (:(restraint. 
A lal)eh'.d (:onstrMnl; is of the form: 
label  C 
whe,'e C is ~t constraint in specitie (lomaill and 
labe l  is ~ label whi(:h expresses t, rengl,h of the 
(:onsl;rainL (/. 
The oper;d, ionM smmmties for HCLP is similar 
Lo CLP exeet)t manipulating a (:Ollstraint hierar- 
chy. In \[\[CLP, we a(:cmnulate labeled consLrMnts 
to form a constraint hierarchy by each 1M)el while 
exe(:uLing CLP until CLP solves all goMs mM gives 
a, reduced required constrMnts. 'Phen, we solve 
constraint hierarchy wiLh required const, rMnLs. 
To solve (:onstrainL hierar(:hy, we firstly lind a 
m;~ximal subseL of constraints for the strongest 
level which is (:onsistent with the require(l con- 
strMnl;s. Then, we try to find a inaximM subset of 
consLraints in the se(:ond strongest, level with re- 
spe(:l: to t, he union of the. required consLrMnt, s and 
Lhe lnaximal (:onsisl;ent subset for l.h(; sLrongest, 
level .... and so on until a maximM consisl;ent sub- 
set of COltsLraints in the k-th strongest, level is 
added. The.n, an assignment which satisfies t;1,e 
final seL of consl;r:tinl;s i  eMled a sol,.tio'n,. 
O a.,t be assignm,;nts C0'(and 
t)e a se.t of constraints in the strongest, level of 
tl,e hierarchy sat, istied t)y 0(amt o), and C~(and 
~2 C?) l)e ~L set; of (:onstrMnts in the secon(l strongest 
level of t.he hierarchy satisfied by 0(and a) .... , an(l 
C~'(,md C a:).~ be a set of (:onstrMnt.s in f.he t,>f.il 
strongest level of Lhe. hierarchy satisfied by 0(an(t 
(7). 
0 is locally-predicate-better (Borning el, el., 
1989) Lluul (~ w.r.L, t, he (:onstrainl. hierarchy if 
there exists i(t  < i < k) such that for (,'very 
j(:l < j < .i c:; : ,,na c:; c 
We can prove thaL if 0 is a solution, t, hen there is 
no assignment ~r which satisfies the required (:on- 
strMnLs and is locally-predicate-better han 0. 
Note l;hal; t;ll(: definition of loeally-t)redicate- 
l)etter (:onlpm'~to," is similar to the definition of 
the orde, r over logical interpretation in the t)ri - 
oritized cir(:umscription. The difference is that 
locally-1)redicate-better (:omparator (:onsiders as- 
signment:s for variabh,,s in constraint;s in I ICLP 
whereas t, he order over h)gical interpret.aLton COil- 
siders ~msignmenl;s of truth-value for formulas in 
1)rioritized circumscril)tion. 
5 Implementation by HCLP 
language 
In order to use, HCLI ) l,~nguage h)r iml)lemen- 
~ation of prioritizcd (:ireunmcripdon, we need 
Lo change t'ornnflas in 1)rioritized circumscription 
into (:onsl:raints in t lCLP. It is done as follows. We 
introduce a domain closure axiom so Lhat we only 
consider relevant constants used in the given sen- 
ten(:es. Then, we inst;mtiztte universM-quandfied 
variM)le, s in background knowledge mM free vari- 
ables in preferen(:es wit, h the relevmlt (:onsL;mts 
and iul~rodu(:e Skolean fimctions for existential- 
qua.ntified variables.
