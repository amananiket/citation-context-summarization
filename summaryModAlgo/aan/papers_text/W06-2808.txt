Abstract 
The problem in processing Chinese chat 
text originates from the anomalous char-
acteristics and dynamic nature of such a 
text genre. That is, it uses ill-edited terms 
and anomalous writing styles in chat text, 
and the anomaly is created and discarded 
very quickly. To handle this problem, 
one solution is to re-train the recognizer 
periodically. This costs a lot of man-
power in producing the timely chat text 
corpus. The new approaches are pro-
posed in this paper to detect the anomaly 
within dynamic Chinese chat text by in-
corporating standard Chinese corpora and 
chat corpus. We first model standard lan-
guage text using standard Chinese cor-
pora and apply these models to detect 
anomalous chat text. To improve detec-
tion quality, we construct anomalous chat 
language model using one static chat text 
corpus and incorporate this model into 
the standard language models. Our ap-
proaches calculate confidence and en-
tropy for the input text and apply thresh-
old values to help make the decisions. 
The experiments prove that performance 
equivalent to the best ones produced by 
the approaches in existence can be 
achieved stably with our approaches.  
1 Introduction 
Network Informal Language (NIL) refers to the 
special human language widely used in the 
community of network communication via plat-
forms such as chat rooms/tools, mobile phone 
short message services (SMS), bulletin board 
systems (BBS), emails, blogs, etc. NIL is ubiqui-
tous due in special to the rapid proliferation of 
Internet applications. As one important type of 
NIL text, chat text appears frequently within in-
creasing volume of chat logs of online education 
(Heard-White, 2004) and customer relationship 
management (Gianforte, 2003) via chat 
rooms/tools. In wed-based chat rooms and BBS a 
large volume of NIL text is abused by (McCul-
lagh, 2004). A survey by the Global System for 
Mobile Communication (GSM) showed that 
Germans send 200 million messages a year 
(German News, 2004). All the facts disclose the 
growing importance in processing NIL text.  
Chat text holds anomalous characteristics in 
forming non-alphabetical characters, words, and 
phrases. It uses ill-edited terms and anomalous 
writing styles. Typical examples of anomalous 
Chinese chat terms can be found in (Xia et. al., 
2005a). Besides the anomalous characteristics, 
our observations reveal remarkable dynamic na-
ture of the chat text. The anomaly is created and 
discarded very quickly. Although there is no idea 
how tomorrow?s chat text would look like, the 
changing will never stop. Instead, the changing 
gets faster and faster.  
The challenging issues originates from the dy-
namic nature are two-fold. On the one hand, 
anomalous chat terms and writing styles are fre-
quently found in chat text. Knowledge about chat 
text is urgently required to understand the anom-
aly. On the other hand, the dynamic nature of the 
chat text makes it nearly impossible to maintain a 
timely chat text knowledge base. This claim has 
been proved by (Xia et. al., 2005a) in which ex-
periments are conducted with an SVM classifier. 
The classifier is trained on chat text created in an 
earlier period and tested on chat text created in a 
later period. In their experiments, performance of 
the SVM classifier becomes lower when the two 
periods are farther. This reveals that chat text is 
written in such a style that changes constantly 
along with time. A straightforward solution to 
this problem is to re-train the SVM classifier pe-
riodically with timely chat text collections. Un-
fortunately, this solution costs a lot of manpower 
in producing new chat text corpora. The super-
48
vised learning technique becomes ineffective in 
processing chat text.  
This paper proposes approaches to detecting 
anomaly in dynamic Chinese chat text by incor-
porating standard Chinese corpora and a static 
chat corpus. The idea is basically error-driven. 
That is, we first create standard language models 
using trigram on standard Chinese corpora. 
These corpora provide negative training samples. 
We then construct anomalous chat language 
model using one static chat text corpus which 
provides positive training samples. We incorpo-
rate the chat language model with the standard 
language models and calculate confidence and 
entropy to help make decisions whether input 
text is anomalous chat text. We investigate two 
types of trigram, i.e. word trigram and part-of-
speech (POS) tag trigram in this work.  
The remaining sections of this paper are or-
ganized as follow.  In Section 2, the works re-
lated to this paper are addressed. In Section 3, 
approaches of anomaly detection in dynamic 
Chinese chat text with standard Chinese corpora 
are presented. In Section 4, we incorporate the 
NIL corpus into our approaches. In section 5, 
experiments are described to estimate threshold 
values and to evaluate performance of the two 
approaches with various configurations. Com-
parisons and discussions are also reported. We 
conclude this paper and address future works in 
Section 6.  
2 Related Works 
Some works had been carried out in (Xia et. al., 
2005a) in which an SVM classifier is imple-
mented to recognize anomalous chat text terms. 
A within-domain open test is conducted on chat 
text posted in March 2005. The SVM classifier is 
trained on five training sets which contain chat 
text posted from December 2004 to February 
2005. The experiments show that performance of 
the SVM classifier increases when the training 
period and test period are closer. This reveals 
that chat text is written in a style that changes 
quickly with time. Many anomalous popular chat 
terms in last year are forgotten today and new 
ones replace them. This makes SVM based pat-
tern learning technique ineffective to reflect the 
changes.  
The solution to this problem in (Xia et. al., 
2005b) is to re-train the SVM classifier periodi-
cally. This costs a lot of manpower in producing 
the timely chat text corpora, in which each piece 
of anomalous chat text should be annotated with 
several attributes manually.  
We argue that the anomalous chat text can be 
identified using negative training samples in 
static Chinese corpora. Our proposal is that we 
model the standard natural language using stan-
dard Chinese corpora. We incorporate a static 
chat text corpus to provide positive training sam-
ples to reflect fundamental characteristics of 
anomalous chat text. We then apply the models 
to detect the anomalous chat text by calculating 
confidence and entropy.  
Regarding the approaches proposed in this pa-
per, our arguments are, 1) the approaches can 
achieve performance equivalent to the best ones 
produced by the approaches in existence; and 2) 
the good performance can be achieved stably. 
We prove these arguments in the following sec-
tions.  
3 Anomaly Detection with Standard 
Chinese Corpora 
Chat text exhibits anomalous characteristics in 
using or forming words. We argue that the 
anomalous chat text, which is referred as anom-
aly in this article, can be identified with language 
models constructed on standard Chinese corpora 
with some statistical language modeling (SLM) 
techniques, e.g. trigram model. 
The problem of anomaly detection can be ad-
dressed as follows. Given a piece of anomalous 
chat text, i.e. },...,,{ 21 nwwwW = , and a language 
model )}({ xpLM = , we attempt to recognize W  
as anomaly by the language model. We propose 
two approaches to tackle this problem. We de-
sign a confidence-based approach to calculate 
how likely that W  fits into the language model. 
Another approach is designed based on entropy 
calculation. Entropy method was originally pro-
posed to estimate how good a language model is. 
In our work we apply this method to estimate 
how much the constructed language models are 
able to reflect the corpora properly based on the 
assumption that the corpora are sound and com-
plete.  
Although there exist numerous statistical 
methods to construct a natural language model, 
the objective of them is one: to construct a prob-
abilistic distribution model )(xp  which fits to the 
most extent into the observed language data in 
the corpus. We implement the trigram model and 
create language models with three Chinese cor-
pora, i.e. People?s Daily corpus, Chinese  Giga-
word and Chinese Pen Treebank. We investigate 
49
quality of the language models produced with 
these corpora. 
3.1 The N-gram Language Models 
N-gram model is the most widely used in statisti-
cal language modeling nowadays. Without loss 
of generality we express the probability of a 
word sequence },...,{ 1 nwwW =  of n words, i.e. 
)(Wp  as  
?
=
?==
n
i
iin wwwwpwwpWp
1
1101 ),...,,|(),...,()(

where 0w  is chosen appropriately to handle the 
initial condition. The probability of the next 
word iw  depends on the history ih  of words 
that have been given so far. With this factoriza-
tion the complexity of the model grows exponen-
tially with the length of the history. 
One of the most successful models of the past 
two decades is the trigram model (n=3) where 
only the most recent two words of the history are 
used to condition the probability of the next 
word. 
Instead of using the actual words, one can use 
a set of word classes. Classes based on the POS 
tags, or the morphological analysis of words, or 
the semantic information have been tried. Also, 
automatically derived classes based on some sta-
tistical models of co-occurrence have been tried 
(Brown et. al., 1990). The class model can be 
generally described as  
?

if the classes are non-overlapping. These tri-class 
models have had higher perplexities than the cor-
responding trigram model. However, they have 
led to a reduction in perplexity when linearly 
combined with the trigram model. 
3.2 The Confidence-based Approach 
Given a piece of chat text },...,,{ 21 nwwwW =  
where each word iw  is obtained with a standard 
Chinese word segmentation tool, e.g. ICTCLAS. 
As ICTCLAS is a segmentation tool based on 
standard vocabulary, it means that some un-
known chat terms (e.g., ????) would be broken 
into several element Chinese words (i.e., ??? 
and ??? in the above case). This does not hurt 
the algorithm because we use trigram in this 
method. A chat term may produce some anoma-
lous word trigrams which are evidences for 
anomaly detection.  
We use non-zero probability for each trigram 
in this calculation. This is very simple but na?ve. 
The calculation seeks to produce a so-called con-
fidence, which reflects how much the given text 
fits into the training corpus in arranging its ele-
ment Chinese words. This is enlightened by the 
observation that the chat terms use element  
words in anomalous manners which can not be 
simulated by the training corpus.  
The confidence-based value is defined as  
( ) KK
i i
TCWC

)( ??
???
?= ?=                  (3) 
where K denotes the number of trigrams in chat 
text W  and iT  is the i-th order trigram. ( )iTC  is 
confidence of trigram iT . Generally ( )iTC  is as-
signed probability of the trigram iT  in training 
corpus, i.e. ( )iTp . When a trigram is missing, 
linear interpolation is applied to estimate its 
probability.  
We empirically setup a confidence threshold 
value to determine whether the input text con-
tains chat terms, namely, it is a piece of chat text. 
The input is concluded to be stand text if its con-
fidence is bigger than the confidence threshold 
value. Otherwise, the input is concluded to be 
chat text. The confidence threshold value can be 
estimated with a training chat text collection.  
3.3 The Entropy-based Approach 
The idea beneath this approach comes from en-
tropy based language modeling. Given a lan-
guage model, one can use the quantity of entropy 
to get an estimation of how good the language 
model (LM) might be. Denote by p the true dis-
tribution, which is unknown to us, of a segment 
of new text x of k words. Then the entropy on a 
per word basis is defined as 
??= ?>? xk xpxpkH )(ln)(1lim              (4) 
If every word in a vocabulary of size |V| is 
equally likely then the entropy would be 
||log 2 V ; ||ln VH ?  for other distributions of 
the words.  
Enlightened by the estimation method, we 
compute the entropy-based value on a per tri-
gram basis for the input chat text. Given a stan-
dard LM denoted by p~  which is modeled  by 
trigram, the entropy-value is calculate as 
50
?

K

)(~ln)(~1~             (5) 
where K denotes number of trigrams the input 
text contains. Our goal is to find how much dif-
ference the input text is compared against the 
LM. Obviously, bigger entropy discloses a piece 
of more anomalous chat text. An empirical en-
tropy threshold is again estimated on a training 
chat text collection. The input is concluded to be 
stand text if its entropy is smaller than the en-
tropy threshold value. Otherwise, the input is 
concluded to be chat text. 
4 Incorporating the Chat Text Corpus 
We argue performance of the approaches can be 
improved when an initial static chat text corpus 
is incorporated. The chat text corpus provides 
some basic forms of the anomalous chat text. 
These forms we observe provide valuable heuris-
tics in the trigram models. Within the chat text 
corpus, we only consider the word trigrams and 
POS tag trigrams in which anomalous chat text 
appears. We thus construct two trigram lists. 
Probabilities are produced for each trigram ac-
cording to its occurrence. One chat text example 
EXP1 is given below.  
EXP1: ?????????? 
SEG1: ? ? ?? ? ?? ? ? ? 
SEG1 presents the word segments produced 
by ICTCLAS. We generate chat text word tri-
grams based on SEG1 as follow. 
TRIGRAM1:   (1)/? ? ??/ 
            (2)/? ?? ?/ 
            (3)/?? ? ?/ 
            (4)/? ? ?/ 
For each input trigram iT , if it appears in the 
chat text corpus, we adjust the confidence and 
entropy values by incorporating its probability in 
chat text corpus.  
4.1 The Refined Confidence 
For each ( )iTC , we assign a weight i? , which is 
calculated as  
)()( icin TpTp
i e ?=?                      (6) 
where )( in Tp  is probability of the trigram iT  in 
standard corpus and )( ic Tp  probability in chat 
text corpus. Equation (3) therefore is re-written 
as  
( )

         (7) 
The intention of inserting i?  into confidence 
calculation is to decrease confidence of input 
chat text when chat text trigrams are found. 
Normally, when a trigram iT  is found in chat text 
trigram lists, )( in Tp  will be much lower than 
)( ic Tp ; therefore i?  will be much lower than 1 . 
By multiplying such a weight, confidence of in-
put chat text can be decreased so that the text can 
be easily detected.  
4.2 The Refined Entropy 
Instead of assigning a weight, we introduce the 
entropy-based value of the input chat text on the 
chat text corpus, i.e. cKH
~ , to produce a new equa-
tion. We denote nKH
~  the entropy calculated with 
equation (5).  Similar to nKH
~ , cKH
~  is calculated 
with equation (8).

The intention of introducing cKH
~  in entropy 
calculation is to increase the entropy of input 
chat text when chat text trigrams are found. It 
can be easily proved that KH
~  is never smaller 
than nKH . As bigger entropy discloses a piece of 
more anomalous chat text, we believe more 
anomalous chat texts can be correctly detected 
with equation (9).  
5 Evaluations 
Three experiments are conducted in this work. 
The first experiment aims to estimate threshold 
values from a real text collection. The remaining 
experiments seek to evaluate performance of the 
approaches with various configurations.   
5.1 Data Description 
We use two types of text corpora to train our ap-
proaches in the experiments. The first type is 
51
standard Chinese corpus which is used to con-
struct standard language models. We use Peo-
ple?s Daily corpus, also know as Peking Univer-
sity Corpus (PKU), the Chinese Gigaword 
(CNGIGA) and the Chinese Penn Treebank 
(CNTB) in this work. Considering coverage, 
CNGIGA is the most excellent one. However, 
PKU and CPT provide more syntactic informa-
tion in their annotations. Another type of training 
corpus is chat text corpus. We use NIL corpus 
described in (Xia et. al., 2005b). In NIL corpus 
each anomalous chat text is annotated with their 
attributes.  
We create four test sets in our experiments. 
We use the test set #1 to estimate the threshold 
values of confidence and entropy for our ap-
proaches. The values are estimated on two types 
of trigrams in three corpora. Test set #1 contains 
89 pieces of typical Chinese chat text selected 
from the NIL corpus and 49 pieces of standard 
Chinese sentences selected from online Chinese 
news by hand. There is no special consideration 
that we select different number of chat texts and 
standard sentences in this test set. 
The remaining three test sets are used to com-
pare performance of our approaches on test data 
created in different time periods. The test set #2 
is the earliest one and #4 the latest one according 
to their time stamp. There are 10K sentences in 
total in test set #2, #3 and #4. In this collection, 
chat texts are selected from YESKY BBS system 
(http://bbs.yesky.com/bbs/) which cover BBS 
text in March and April 2005 (later than the chat 
text in the NIL corpus), and standard texts are 
extracted from online Chinese news randomly. 
We describe the four test sets in Table 1.

5.2 Experiment I: Threshold Values Esti-
mation 
5.2.1 Experiment Description 
This experiment seeks to estimate the threshold 
values of confidence and entropy for two types 
of trigrams in three Chinese corpora.  
We first run the two approaches using only 
standard Chinese corpora on the 138 sentences in 
the first test set. We put the calculated values 
(confidence or entropy) into two arrays. Note 
that we already know type of each sentence in 
the first test set. So we are able to select in each 
array a value that produces the lowest error rate. 
In this way we obtain the first group of threshold 
values for our approaches.  
We incorporate the NIL corpus to the two ap-
proaches and run them again. We then produce 
the second group of threshold values in the same 
way to produce the first group of values.

We use the selected threshold values in ex-
periment II and III to detect anomalous chat text 
within test set #2, #3 and #4. 
5.3 Experiment II: Anomaly Detection with 
Three Standard Chinese Corpora 
5.3.1 Experiment Description 
In this experiment, we run the two approaches 
using the standard Chinese corpora on test set #2. 
The threshold values estimated in experiment I 
are applied to help make decisions.  
Input text can be detected as either standard 
text or chat text. But we are only interested in 
how correctly the anomalous chat text is de-
tected. Thus we calculate precision (p), recall (r) 
and 1F  measure (f) only for chat text.

5.3.2 Results 
The experiment results for the approaches using 
the standard Chinese corpora on test set #2 are 
presented in Table 6. 
5.3.3 Discussions 
Table 4 shows that, in most cases, the entropy-
based approach outperforms the confidence-
based approach slightly. It can thus be conclude 
that the entropy-based approach is more effective 
in anomaly detection.  
It is also revealed that both approaches per-
form better with word trigrams than that with 
POS tag trigrams. This is natural for class based 
trigram model when number of class is small. 
Thirty-nine classes are used in ICTCLAS in POS 
tagging Chinese words.  
When the three Chinese corpora are compared, 
the CNGIGA performs best in the confidence-
based approach with word trigram model. How-
ever, it is not the case with POS tag trigram 
model. Results of two approaches on CNTB are 
best amongst the three corpora. Although we are 
able to draw the conclusion that  bigger corpora 
yields better performance with word trigram, the 
same conclusion, however, does not work for 
POS tag trigram. This is very interesting. The 
reason we can address on this issue is that CNTB 
probably provides highest quality POS tag tri-
grams and other corpora contain more noisy POS 
tag trigrams, which eventually decreases the per-
formance. An observation on word/POS tag lists 
for three Chinese corpora verifies such a claim. 
Text in CNTB is best-edited amongst the three.  
5.4 Experiment III: Anomaly Detection 
with NIL Corpus Incorporated 
5.4.1 Experiment Description 
In this experiment, we incorporate one chat text 
corpus, i.e. NIL corpus, to the two approaches. 
We run them on test set #2, #3 and #4 with the 
estimated threshold values. We use precision, 
recall and 1F  measure again to evaluate perform-
ance of the two approaches. 
5.4.2 Results 
The experiment results are presented in Table 7~ 
Table 9 on test set #2,  #3 and #4 respectively. 
5.4.3 Discussions 
We first compare the two approaches with dif-
ferent running configurations. All conclusions 
made in experiment II still work for experiment 
III. They are, i) the entropy-based approach out-
performs the confidence-based approach slightly 
in most cases; ii) both approach perform better 
with word trigram than POS tag trigram; iii) both 
approaches perform best on CNGIGA with word 
trigram model. But with POS tag trigram model, 
CNTB produces the best results.  
An interesting comparison is conducted on 1F  
measure between the approaches in experiment II 
and experiment III on test set #2 in Figure 1 (the 
left two columns). Generally, 1F  measure of 
anomaly detection with both approaches with 
word trigram model is improved when the NIL 
corpus is incorporated. It is revealed in Table 
7~9 that same observation is found with POS tag 
trigram model.  
We compare 1F  measure of the approaches 
with word trigram model in experiment III on 
test set #2, #3 and #4 in Figure 1 (the right three 
columns). The graph in Figure 1 shows that 1F  
measure on three test sets are very close to each 
other. This is also true the approaches with POS 
tag trigram model as showed in Table 7~9. This 
provides evidences for the argument that the ap-
proaches can produce stable performance with 
the NIL corpus. Differently, as reported in (Xia 
et. al., 2005a), performance achieved in SVM 
classifier is rather unstable. It performs poorly 
with training set C#1 which contains BBS text 
posted several months ago, but much better with 
training set C#5 which contains the latest chat 
text.

Figure 1: Comparisons on 1F  measure of the approaches with word trigram on test set #2, #3 and #4 in 
experiment II and experiment III. 
 
We finally compare performance of our ap-
proaches against the one described in (Xia, et. 
al., 2005a). The best 1F  measure achieved in our 
work, i.e. 0. 853, is close to the best one in their 
work, i.e. 0.871 with training corpus C#5. This 
proves another argument that our approaches can 
produce equivalent performance to the best ones 
achieved by the approaches in existence. 
6 Conclusions  
The new approaches to detecting anomalous 
Chinese chat text are proposed in this paper. The 
approaches calculate confidence and entropy 
values with the language models constructed on 
negative training samples in three standard Chi-
54
nese corpora. To improve detection quality, we 
incorporate positive training samples in NIL cor-
pus in our approaches. Two conclusions can be 
made based on this work. Firstly, 1F  measure of 
anomaly detection can be improved by around 
0.10 when NIL corpus is incorporated into the 
approaches. Secondly, performance equivalent to 
the best ones produced by the approaches in exis-
tence can be achieved stably by incorporating the 
standard Chinese corpora and the NIL corpus.  
We believe some strong evidences for our 
claims can be obtained by training our ap-
proaches with more chat text corpora which con-
tain chat text created in different time periods. 
We are conducting this experiment seeks to find 
out whether and how our approaches are inde-
pendent of time. This work is still progressing. A 
report on this issue will be available shortly. We 
also plan to investigate how size of chat text cor-
pus influences performance of our approaches. 
The goal is to find the optimal size of chat text 
corpus which can achieve the best performance. 
The readers should also be noted that evaluation 
in this work is a within-domain test. Due to 
shortage of chat text resources, no cross-domain 
test is conducted. In the future cross-domain test, 
we will investigate how our approaches are inde-
pendent of domain.  
Eventual goal of chat text processing is to nor-
malize the anomalous chat text, namely, convert 
it to standard text holding the same meaning. So 
the work carried out in this paper is the first step 
leading to this goal. Approaches will be designed 
to locate the anomalous terms in chat text and 
map them to standard words.
