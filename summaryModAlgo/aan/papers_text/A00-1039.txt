Information Extraction (IE) systems are com- 
monly based on pattern matching. Adapting 
an IE system to a new scenario entails the 
construction of a new pattern base---a time- 
consuming and expensive process. We have 
implemented a system for finding patterns au- 
tomatically from un-annotated text. Starting 
with a small initial set of seed patterns proposed 
by the user, the system applies an incremental 
discovery procedure to identify new patterns. 
We present experiments with evaluations which 
show that the resulting patterns exhibit high 
precision and recall.

The task of Information Extraction (I-E) is 
the selective extraction of meaning from free 
natural language text. I "Meaning" is under- 
stood here in terms of a fixed set of semantic 
objects--entities, relationships among entities, 
and events in which entities participate. The 
semantic objects belong to a small number of 
types, all having fixed regular structure, within 
a fixed and closely circumscribed subject do- 
main. The extracted objects are then stored in 
a relational database. In this paper, we use the 
nomenclature accepted in current IE literature; 
the term subject domain denotes a class of tex- 
tual documents to be processed, e.g., "business 
news," and scenario denotes the specific topic 
of interest within the domain, i.e., the set of 
facts to be extracted. One example of a sce- 
nario is "management succession," the topic of 
MUC-6 (the Sixth Message Understanding Con- 
ference); in this scenario the system seeks to 
identify events in which corporate managers left

1997; muc, 1995; muc, 1993). 
their posts or assumed new ones. We will con- 
sider this scenario in detail in a later section 
describing experiments. 
IE systems today are commonly based on pat- 
tern matching. The patterns are regular ex- 
pressions, stored in a "pattern base" containing 
a general-purpose component and a substantial 
domain- and scenario-specific component. 
Portability and performance are two major 
problem areas which are recognized as imped- 
ing widespread use of IE. This paper presents a
novel approach, which addresses both of these 
problems by automatically discovering good 
patterns for a new scenario. The viability of 
our approach is tested and evaluated with an 
actual IE system. 
In the next section we describe the problem in 
more detail in the context of our IE system; sec- 
tions 2 and 3 describe our algorithm for pattern 
discovery; section 4 describes our experimental 
results, followed by comparison with prior work 
and discussion, in section 5. 
1 The  IE  Sys tem 
Our IE system, among others, contains a a back- 
end core engine, at the heart of which is a 
regular-e~xpression pattern matcher. The engine 
draws on attendant knowledge bases (KBs) of 
varying degrees of domain-specificity. The KB 
components are commonly factored out to make 
the systems portable to new scenarios. There 
are four customizable knowledge bases in our IE 
system: the Lexicon contains general dictionar- 
ies and scenario-specific terms; the concept base 
groups terms into classes; the predicate base de- 
scribes the logical structure of events to be ex- 
tracted, and the pattern base contains patterns 
that catch the events in text. 
Each KB has a. substantial domain-specific 
component, which must be modified when mov-  
282 
ing to new domains and scenarios. The system 
allows the user (i.e. scenario developer) to start 
with example sentences in text which contain 
events of interest, the candidates, and general- 
ize them into patterns. However, the user is 
ultimately responsible for finding all the can- 
didates, which amounts to manually processing 
example sentences in a very large training cor- 
pus. Should s/he fail to provide an example 
of a particular class of syntactic/semantic con- 
struction, the system has no hope of recovering 
the corresponding events. Our experience has 
shown that (1) the process of discovering candi- 
dates is highly expensive, and (2) gaps in pat- 
terns directly translate into gaps in coverage. 
How can the system help automate the pro- 
cess of discovering new good candidates? The 
system should find examples of all common lin- 
guistic constructs relevant o a scenario. While 
there has been prior research on identifying the 
primary lexical patterns of a sub-language or 
corpus (Grishman et al, 1986; Riloff, 1996), the 
task here is more complex, since we are typi- 
cally not provided in advance with a sub-corpus 
of relevant passages; these passages must them- 
selves be found as part of the discovery process. 
The difficulty is that one of the best indications 
of the relevance of the passages i precisely the 
presence of these constructs. Because of this 
circularity, we propose to acquire the constructs 
and passages in tandem. 
2 So lu t ion  
We outline our procedure for automatic ac- 
quisition of patterns; details are elaborated in 
later sections. The procedure is unsupervised 
in that it does not require the training corpus 
to be manually annotated with events of inter- 
est, nor a pro-classified corpus with relevance 
judgements, nor any feedback or intervention 
from the user 2. The idea is to combine IR-style 
document selection with an iterative relaxation 
process; this is similar to techniques used else- 
where in NLP, and is inspired in large part, if 
remotely, by the work of (Kay and RSscheisen, 
1993) on automatic alignment of sentences and 
words in a bilingual corpus. There, the reason- 
ing was: sentences that are translations of each 
2however, it may be supervised after each iteration, 
where the user can answer yes/no questions to improve 
the quality of the results 
other are good indicators that words they con- 
tain are translation pairs; conversely, words that 
are translation pairs indicate that the sentences 
which contain them correspond to one another. 
In our context, we observe that documents 
that are relevant to the scenario will neces- 
sarily contain good patterns; conversely, good 
patterns are strong indicators of relevant docu- 
ments. The outline of our approach is as follows. 
. 
. 
Given: (1) a large corpus of un-annotated 
and un-classified documents in the domain; 
(2) an initial set of trusted scenario pat- 
terns, as chosen ad hoc by the user--the 
seed; as will be seen, the seed can be quite 
small--two or three patterns eem to suf- 
fice. (3) an initial (possibly empty) set of 
concept classes 
The pattern set induces a binary partition 
(a split) on the corpus: on any document, 
either zero or more than zero patterns will 
match. Thus the universe of documents, U, 
is partitioned into the relevant sub-corpus, 
R, vs. the non-relevant sub-corpus, R = 
U - R, with respect o the given pattern 
set. Actually, the documents are assigned 
weights which are 1 for documents matched 
by the trusted seed, and 0 otherwise. 3 
2. Search for new candidate patterns: 
(a) Automatically convert each sentence 
in the corpus,into a set of candidate 
patterns, 4 
(b) Generalize each pattern by replacing 
each lexical item which is a member of 
a concept class by the class name. 
(c) Working from the relevant documents, 
select those patterns whose distribu- 
tion is strongly correlated with other 
relevant documents (i.e., much more 
3R represents he trusted truth through the discovery 
iterations, since it was induced by the manually-selected 
seed. 
4Here, for each clause in the sentence we extract a 
tuple of its major roles: the head of the subject, the 
verb group, the object, object complement, asdescribed 
below. This tuple is considered to be a pattern for the 
present purposes of discovery; it is a skeleton for the 
rich, syntactically transformed patterns our system uses 
in the extraction phase. 
283 
densely distributed among the rele- 
vant documents than among the non- 
relevant ones). The idea is to consider 
those candidate patterns, p, which 
meet the density, criterion: 
IHnRI IRI - - > >  
IHnUI IUI 
where H = H(p) is the set of docu- 
ments where p hits. 
(d) Based on co-occurrence with the cho- 
sen patterns, extend the concept 
classes. 
3. Optional: Present he new candidates and 
classes to the user for review, retaining 
those relevant o the scenario. 
4. The new pattern set induces a new parti- 
tion on the corpus. With this pattern set, 
return to step 1. Repeat he procedure un- 
til no more patterns can be added. 
3 Methodo logy  
3.1 Pre-proeess ing:  Normal i za t ion  
Before applying the discovery procedure, we 
subject the corpus to several stages o f  pre- 
processing. First, we apply a name recognition 
module, and replace each name with a token 
describing its class, e.g. C-Person, C-Company, 
etc. We collapse together all numeric expres- 
sions, currency values, dates, etc., using a single 
token to designate ach of these classes. 
3.2 Syntact ic  Analys is  
We then apply a parser to perform syntactic 
normalization to transform each clause into a 
common predicate-argument structure. We use 
the general-purpose d pendency parser of En- 
glish, based on the FDG formalism (Tapanainen 
and J~rvinen, 1997) and developed by the Re- 
search Unit for Multilingual Language Technol- 
ogy at the University of Helsinki, and Conexor 
Oy. The parser (modified to understand the 
name labels attached in the previous step) is 
used for reducing such variants as passive and 
relative clauses to a tuple, consisting of several 
elements. 
1. For each claus, the first element is the sub- 
ject, a "semantic" subject of a non-finite 
sentence or agent of the passive. 5 
2. The second element is the verb. 
3. The third element is the object, certain 
object-like adverbs, subject of the passive 
or subject complement 6 
4. The fourth element is a phrase which 
refers to the object or the subject. A 
typical example of such an argument is 
an object complement, such as Com- 
pany named John Smith pres ident .  An- 
other instance is the so-called copredica- 
tire (Nichols, 1978), in the parsing system 
(J~irvinen and Tapanainen, 1997). A co- 
predicative refers to a subject or an object, 
though this distinction is typically difficult 
to resolve automatically/ 
Clausal tuples also contain a locative modifier, 
and a temporal modifier. We used a corpus of 
5,963 articles from the Wall Street Journal, ran- 
domly chosen. The parsed articles yielded a to- 
tal of 250,000 clausal tuples, of which 135,000 
were distinct. 
3.3 Genera l i za t ion  and  Concept  Classes 
Because tuples may not repeat with sufficient 
frequency to obtain reliable statistics, each tu- 
ple is reduced to a set of pairs: e.g., a verb- 
object pair, a subject-object pair, etc. Each 
pair is used as a generalized pattern during 
the candidate selection stage. Once we have 
identified pairs which are relevant o the sce- 
nario, we use them to construct or augment con- 
cept classes, by grouping together the missing 
roles, (for example, a class of verbs which oc- 
cur with a relevant subject-object pair: "com- 
pany (hire/fire/expel...} person"). This is sim- 
ilar to work by several other groups which 
aims to induce semantic lasses through syn- 
tactic co-occurrence analysis (Riloff and Jones, 
1999; Pereira et al, 1993; Dagan et al, 1993; 
Hirschman et al, 1975), although in .our case 
the contexts are limited to selected patterns, 
relevant o the scenario. 
SE.g., " John sleeps", "John is appointed by 
Company" ,  "I saw a dog which sleeps", "She asked 
John  to buy a car". 
6E.g., " John is appointed by Company", "John is the 
pres ident  of Company", "I saw a dog which sleeps", 
The dog  which I saw sleeps. 
7For example, "She gave us our coffee black",  "Com- 
pany appointed John Smith as pres ident" .

3.4 Pattern Discovery 
Here we present he results from experiments 
we conducted on the MUC-6 scenario, "man- 
agement succession". The discovery procedure 
was seeded with a small pattern set, namely: 
Subject Verb Direct Object 
C-Company C-Appoint C-Person 
C-Person C-Resign 
Documents are assigned relevance scores on 
a scale between 0 and 1. The seed patterns 
are accepted as ground truth; thus the docu- 
ments they match have relevance 1. On sub- 
sequent iterations, the newly accepted patterns 
are not trusted as absolutely. On iteration um- 
ber i q- 1, each pattern p is assigned a precision 
measure, based on the relevance of the docu- 
ments it matches: 
Here C-Company and C-Person denote se- 
mantic classes containing named entities of the 
corresponding semantic types. C-Appoirlt de- 
notes a class of verbs, containing four verbs 
{ appoint, elect, promote, name}; C-Resign = 
{ resign, depart, quit, step-down }. 
During a single iteration, we compute the 
score s, L(p), for each candidate pattern p: 
L(p) = Pc(P)" log {H A R\] (1) 
where R denotes the relevant subset, and H -- 
H(p) the documents matching p, as above, and 
\[gnR\[ Pc(P) -- Igl is the conditional probability of 
relevance. We further impose two support cri- 
teria: we distrust such frequent patterns where 
\[HA U{ > a\[U\[ as uninformative, and rare pat- 
terns for which \[H A R\[ </3  as noise. ? At the 
end of each iteration, the system selects the pat- 
tern with the highest score, L(p), and adds it to 
the seed set. The documents which the winning 
pattern hits are added to the relevant set. The 
pattern search is then restarted. 
3.5 Re-computat lon  of  Document  
Relevance 
The above is a simplification of the actual pro- 
cedure, in several important respects. 
Only generalized patterns are considered for 
candidacy, with one or more slots filled with 
wild-cards. In computing the score of the gen- 
eralized pattern, we do not take into considera- 
tion all possible values of the wild-card role. We 
instead constrain the wild-card to those values 
which themselves in turn produce patterns with 
high scores. These values then become members 
of a new class, which is output in tandem with 
the winning pattern 1? 
Ssimilarly to (Riloff, 1996) 
?U denotes the universe of documents. We used c~ = 
0.i and ~----- 2. 
1?The classes are currently unused by subsequent i er- 
ations; this important issue is considered in future work. 
Preci+l(p) = 1 {H(p){ ~ Reli(d) (2) 
dEH(p) 
where Reli(d) is the relevance of the document 
from the previous iteration, and H(p) is the set 
of documents where p matched. More generally, 
if K is a classifier consisting of a set of patterns, 
we can define H(K) as the set of documents 
where all of patterns p E K match, and the 
"cumulative" precision 11 of K as 
Preci+l(K) = 1 ~ Reli(d) (3) 
IH(K)\[ riCH(K) 
Once the new winning pattern is accepted, 
the relevance scores of the documents are re- 
adjusted as follows. For each document d which 
is matched by some (non-empty) subset of the 
currently accepted patterns, we can view that 
subset of patterns as a classifier K d = {py}. 
These patterns determine the new relevance 
score of the document 
Reli+l(d) = max (Rel~(d),Prec~+l(Kd)) (4) 
This ensures that the relevance score grows 
monotonically, and only when there is sufficient 
positive evidence, as the patterns in effect vote 
"conjunctively" on the documents. The results 
which follow use this measure. 
Thus in the formulas above, R is not sim- 
ply the count of the relevant documents, but 
is rather their cumulative relevance. The two 
formulas, (3) and (4), capture the mutual de- 
pendency of patterns and documents; this re- 
computation and growing of precision and rele- 
vance scores is at the heart of the procedure. 
11Of course, this measure is defined only when 
H(K) # 0. 
285 
4 Resu l ts  1 
An objective measure of goodness of a pattern o. 9 
is not trivial to establish since the patterns can- 
not be used for extraction directly, without be- o. s 
ing properly incorporated into the knowledge 
base. Thus, the discovery procedure does not o. v 
lend itself easily to MUC-style evaluations, ince 
0.6  a pattern lacks information about which events 
it induces and which slots its arguments should 0.5  
fill. 
However, it is possible to apply some objec- o. a 
tive measures of performance. One way we eval- 
uated the system is by noting that in addition o.  
to growing the pattern set, the procedure also 
grows the relevance of documents. The latter o. 2 
can be objectively evaluated. 
0.1  
We used a test corpus of 100 MUC-6 formal- 
training documents (which were included in the o 
main development corpus of about 6000 docu- 
ments) plus another 150 documents picked at 
random from the main corpus and judged by 
hand. These judgements constituted the ground 
truth and were used only for evaluation, (not in 
the discovery procedure). 
4.1 Text  F i l ter ing 
Figure 1 shows the recall/precision measures 
with respect to the test corpus of 250 docu- 
ments, over a span of 60 generations, tarting 
with the seed set in table 3.4. The Seed pat- 
terns matched 184 of the 5963 documents, yield- 
ing an initial recall of .11 and precision of .93; 
by the last generation it searched through 982 
documents with non-zero relevance, and ended 
with .80 precision and .78 recall. This facet of 
the discovery procedure is closely related to the 
MUC '%ext-filtering" sub-task, where the sys- 
tems are judged at the level of documents rather 
than event slots. It is interesting to compare the 
results with other MUC-6 participants, shown 
anonymously in figure 2. Considering recall and 
precision separately, the discovery procedure at- 
tains values comparable to those achieved by 
some of the participants, all of which were ei- 
ther heavily-supervised or manually coded sys- 
tems. It is important o bear in mind that the 
discovery procedure had no benefit of training 
material, or any information beyond the seed 
pattern set.

4.2 Cho ice  of  Test  Corpus  
Figure 2 shows two evaluations of our discovery 
procedure, tested against the original MUC-6 
corpus of 100 documents, and against our test 
corpus, which consists of an additional 150 doc- 
uments judged manually. The two plots in the 
figure show a slight difference in results, indi- 
cating that in some sense, the MUC corpus was 
more "random", or that our expanded corpus 
was somewhat skewed in favor of more common 
patterns that the system is able to find more 
easily. 
4.3 Cho ice  of  Eva luat ion  Met r i c  
The graphs shown in Figures 1 and 2 are based 
on an "objective" measure we adopted during 
the experiments. This is the same measure of 
relevance used internally by the discovery proce- 
dure on each iteration (relative to the "truth" of 
relevance scores of the previous iteration), and 
is not quite the standard measure used for text 
filtering in IR. According to this measure, the 
system gets a score for each document based on 
the relevance which it assigned to the document. 
Thus if the system .assigned relevance of X per- 
cent to a relevant document, it only received X

percent on the recall score for classifying that 
document correctly. Similarly, if the system as- 
signed relevance Y to an irrelevant document, 
it was penalized only for the mis-classified Y
percent on the precision score. To make our re- 
sults more comparable to those of other MUC 
competitors, we chose a cut-off point and force 
the system to make a binary relevance decision 
on each document. The cut-off of 0.5 seemed 
optimal from empirical observations. Figure 3 
shows a noticeable improvement in scores, when 
using our continuous, "objective" measure, vs. 
the cut-off measure, with the entire graph essen- 
tially translated to the right for a gain of almost 
10 percentage points of recall. 
4.4 Eva luat ing  Pat terns  
Another effective, if simple, measure of perfor- 
mance is  how many of the patterns the pro- 
cedure found, and comparing them with those 
used by an extraction engine which was manu- 
ally constructed for the same task. Our MUC-6 
system used approximately 75 clause level pat- 
terns, with 30 distinct verbal heads. In one 
conservative experiment, we observed that the 
discovery procedure found 17 of these verbs, or 
57%. However, it also found at least 8 verbs the 
manual system lacked, which seemed relevant to 
the scenario: 
company-bring-person-\[as?officer\] 12 
person-come-\[to+eompanv\]-\[as+oZScer\] 
person-rejoin- company-\[as + o25cer\] 
person-{ ret  , conti,  e, remai, ,stay}-\[as + o25cer\] 
person-pursue-interest 
At the risk of igniting a philosophical de- 
bate over what is or is not relevant o a sce- 
nario, we note that the first four of these verbs 
are evidently essential to the scenario in the 
strictest definition, since they imply changes of 
post. The next three are "staying" verbs, and 
are actually also needed, since higher-level infer- 
ences required in tracking events for long-range 
merging over documents, require knowledge of 
persons occupying posts, rather than only as- 
suming or leaving them. The most curious one 
is "person-pursue-interesf'; urprisingly, it too 
is useful, even in the strictest MUC sense, cf., 
(muc, 1995). Systems are judged on filling a 
slot called "other-organization", i dicating from 
or to which company the person came or went. 
This pattern is consistently used in text to indi- 
nbracketed  const i tuents  a re  outs ide  o f  the  cent ra l

287 
cate that the person left to pursue other, undis- 
closed interests, the knowledge of which would 
relieve the system from seeking other informa- 
tion in order to fill this slot. This is to say that 
here strict evaluation is elusive. 
5 D iscuss ion  and  Cur rent  Work  
Some of the prior research as emphasized in- 
teractive tools to convert examples to extraction 
patterns, cf. (Yangarber and Grishman, 1997), 
while others have focused on methods for au- 
tomatically converting a corpus annotated with 
extraction examples into such patterns (Lehn- 
ert et al, 1992; Fisher et al, 1995; Miller et 
al., 1998). These methods, however, do not re- 
duce the burden of finding the examples to an- 
notate. With either approach, the portability 
bottleneck is shifted from the problem of build- 
ing patterns to that of finding good candidates. 
The prior work most closely related to this 
study is (Riloff, 1996), which, along with (Riloff, 
1993), seeks automatic methods for filling slots 
in event templates. However, the prior work 
differs from that presented here in several cru- 
cial respects; firstly, the prior work does not at- 
tempt to find entire events, after the fashion 
of MUC's highest-level scenario-template task. 
Rather the patterns produced by those systems 
identify NPs that fill individual slots, without 
specifying how these slots may be combined 
at a later stage into complete vent templates. 
The present work focuses on directly discovering 
event-level, multi-slot relational patterns. Sec- 
ondly, the prior work either relies on a set of 
documents with relevance judgements to find 
slot fillers where they are relevant o events, 
(Riloff, 1996), or utilizes an un-classified cor- 
pus containing a very high proportion of rele- 
vant documents o find all instances of a seman- 
tic class, (Riloff and Jones, 1999). By contrast, 
our procedure requires no relevance judgements, 
and works on the assumption that the corpus is 
balanced and the proportion of relevant docu- 
ments is small. Classifying documents by hand, 
although admittedly easier than tagging event 
instances in text for automatic training, is still 
a formidable task. When we prepared the test 
corpus, it took 5 hours to mark 150 short doc- 
uments. 
The presented results indicate that our 
method of corpus analysis can be used to rapidly 
identify a large number of relevant patterns 
without pre-classifying a large training corpus. 
We are at the early stages of understanding 
how to optimally tune these techniques, and 
there are number of areas that need refinement. 
We are working on capturing the rich informa- 
tion about concept classes which is currently re- 
turned as part of our pattern discovery proce- 
dure, to build up a concept dictionary in tandem 
with the pattern base. We are also consider- 
ing the proper selection of weights and thresh- 
olds for controlling the rankings of patterns and 
documents, criteria for terminating the itera- 
tion process, and for dynamic adjustments of 
these weights. We feel that the generalization 
technique in pattern discovery offers a great 
opportunity for combating sparseness of data, 
though this requires further research. Lastly, 
we are studying these algorithms under several 
unrelated scenarios to determine to what extent 
scenario-specific phenomena affect their perfor- 
mance.
