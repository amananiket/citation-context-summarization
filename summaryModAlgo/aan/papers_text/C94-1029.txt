Abstract 
This I)aper presents an implemented multi-tal)e two- 
level model capable of describing Semitie non-linear 
morphology. The computational fl'arnework behind the 
ettrrcnt work is motivated by \[Kay 1987\]; the fimnal- 
ism presented here is an extension to the formalism re- 
ported by \[Puhnan art(1 Hepl)le. 1993\]. The objectives 
of the current work are: to stay as close as possible, 
in spirit, to standard two-level morl)hology, to stay 
close to the linguistic description of Semitic stems, and 
to present a model which can be used with ease by 
the Semitist. The. Imper illustrates that if finite-state 
transducers (FSTs) in a standard two-level morphology 
model are replaced with multi-tape attxiliary versions 
(AFSTs),  one can account for Semitic root-andq)attern 
morphology using high level notation. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
This paper aims at presenting a computational mor- 
phology model which can handle the non-linear 
phenomenon of Semitic morphology. The ap- 
proach presented here builds on two-level mori)hology 
\[Koskennienfi 1983\], extending it to achieve the desired 
objective. Tit('. contril)ution of this l)almr tnay \])e Slllll- 
marised as follows: 
With regards to the two-level model, we extend this 
model by allowing it to have multiI)le tapes on the lex- 
ical level and retaining the one tape on the surface 
level; hence, 'multi-tape two-level morphology'. Feasi- 
ble pairs in the standard two-level model become 'fea- 
sible tuple pairs' in our multi-tape model. 
With regards to the formalism, we have. chosen a 
twodevel formalism and extended it to be al)le to 
write multi-tape two-level grammars which involve 
non-linear operations. To achieve this, we made all 
lexieal expressions n-tuple regular expressions. In ad- 
dition, we introduced the notion of 'ellipsis', which in-

Non-linear root -and-pat tern  morphology is best il+ 
lustrated in Semitic. A Setnitic stem (:onsists of a root  
and a vowel tnelody, ;u'rattged according to a canon- 
ic.al i)atte.rn. For examph~, Arahic/Iv'uttib/ 'caused t.o 
write' is composed front the root murphenm {ktb} 'no- 
tion of wril.inp;' and the vowel melody morpheme {ui} 
'pertlwt lmssive'; the two are arr:mged act:ording to the 
pattern morpheme {CVCCVC} 'causative'.

of the domain of the root-an(l-l)attern system, such as 
particles and preposil,ions, are. (:lassitied as belonging 
to a third (:lass consisting of successions of consonants

root {ktb} 'notion of writing' and the pattern {_.u_:i }

nan( slot, and : indicates gemination).

In the past decade, two-level morl)hology, introduced 
t)y \[I(oskenniemi 1983\], has I)ecomc ubiquitous, in sec- 
tion 3.1, we shall take a l)rM' look at two-level morl)hol- 
ogy. Section 3.2 gives a brief review of the previous pro- 
posals for dealing with Semitic non-linear mori)hology. 
Section 3.3 looks at the development of the \[ormalism 
which we have chosen for our proposal. 
3.1 Two-Leve l  Morpho logy  
q'his approach de\[ines two levels of strings in recogni- 
tion and synthesis: lexical and surface, the former is a 
represent.ation f lexic;d strings; the latter is a represen- 
i.;ttir)n of Slit(ace sl,rillgs. A lltlai)l)ing seheltle 1)etweell 
the t, wo levels is described by rules wlfieh are compiled 
into I;'STs; the seI. of I;'STs rml in parallel. One c.ase of 
~.wo-level rules l.;tkes the following form: 
, :b  :> c :d___c : f  
i.e. lexicai a eorresl)Oll(lS (;0 surface b wh(!ll l)i'eeeeded 
by lexical c corresponding; to surface d and followed by 
h!xical e corresponding to sllrfat;e f. The olmrai, or is

for it NIII'\[';WO (',oercioIl rllle, ?5 for & eolllposite rule (i.(',. 
a c.ol,q)osit.ion o\[ > and <:=), and /?= \['or an exclusion 
rule. lh!re is an example from \[Ill(chic 1992\]:

The process can He deseriHed l)y the rules:

liule I is t.he defau l t  rule., where a lexi(:;d charac. 
ter al)l)ears oil the mlrfat:e. \]~.llle 2 is the I )oml( lary 
rule, where l;he lexieal morph(mm boundary symbol is 
deleted on the surface (i.e. surfaces as '0'). l{ule 3 
sl:at.es the deletion of lexical \[e\] in {re(we} in the. con- 
t;ext shown. 
One can see t.hat two-level morl)hology is highly in- 
lhmneed by co\[icatellative morphology: the first re- 
quirement for at sm'faee form to be related t:o a lexi- 
cal tbrm, given by \[/{.itchie 1992\], states that  "the lex- 
ical t;alm is the eont:atcnatimz of the lexieal forms in 
qul!sl.ion..." (italics mine). This makes it extremely 
ditlieult, if not imlmssil)le , to apply the mttonomous

3.2  Prev ious  P roposa ls  
Working within standard two-level morphology, 
\[Kataja nd Koskenniemi 1988\] went around the prob- 
lem. Nominal forms, such as / k i taab/  'book', were en- 
tered in the lexicon. Vert)al forms were derived by a 
'lexicon component'.  A verb, such as /nkutib/ (form 
7), has the lexical entries 
n E1 u El i El 
where El is the alphabet of the root and E~ the al- 
phabet of the vocalism/affixes. Tim lexicon compovent 
takes the intersection of these two expressions and pro- 
duces/nkut ib / .  Now/nkut ib / i s  fed on the lcxical tape 
of a standard two-level system wtfich takes care of con- 
ditional phonetic dmnges (assimilation, deletion, etc.) 
and produces/'einkutib/, a A similar approach was used 
by \[Lavie et al 1988\] for IIehrew using a 'pre-h!xical 
compiler'. 
\[Kay 1987\] proposed a finite-state aplnoacl~ using 
fimr tapes for root, CV-skeleton, vowel melody and 
surface, each having an indel)endent head, i.e. the ma- 
chine can scan from one lexical tape without moving 
the head on other lexieal tapes. The absence of mo- 
tion is indicated by ad hoc notation coded in the lexical 
strings. 
\[Beesley 1991\], working on Arabic, impleme,ited a 
two-level system with 'detours', where, according to 
\[Sproat 1992, p. 163-64\], detouring involves nmltiple 
dictionaries being open at a time, one for roots and one 
for templates with vowels pre-compiled (as in iIarris' 
description). 
Other non two-level models were proposed (there 
is no place here for a review of ttmse works): 
\[Kornai 1991\] proposed a model for autosegmental 
l/honology using FSTs, where non-linear autoseg- 
mental representations are coded as linear strings. 
\[llird and Ellison 1992\] proposed a model llased on 
one-level phonology using FSA to model representa- 
tions and rules. \[Wiel)e 1992\] pr(llmsed I,l(Jdellii,g au- 
tosegmental phonology using multi-tal/e FSTs, where 
mitosegmental representations m'e coded in arrays. 
\[Puhnan and Hepi)le 1993\] prol)osed a formalism for 
bidirectional segmental phonological processing, and 
i)roposed using it for Arabic. The next subsection 
presents the develoi)ment of this formalism. 
3.3  P rev ious  Formal i sms  
\[Black et  al. 1987\] pointed out ttmt previous two-level 
rules (cf. ,~a.1) affect one character at a time and pro- 
posed a formalism wtfich maps tletween (equal ram> 
bered) sequences of surface and lexical characters of 
the form, 
SURF ~ LEX 
alnidal consonant clusters, CC, take a prosthetic /Pi/. 
A lexical s t r ing  maps l;o a sllrfaee sLring iff they 
can be partitioned into pairs of lexical-sm'fi~ce, sub- 
sequences, wtmre each pair is licenced I)y a rule. 
\[l\].uessink 1989\] added explicit contexts and allowed 
unequal sequences. \[Puhnan and IIepple 19931 (level- 
oiled the l'ormalism further, allowing feature-based rep- 
resentations interpreted via unification. 
The developed formalism is llased on the existence of 
only two levels of rel)resentation: sm'face and lexical. 
Two types of rules are provided: 
LSC - SuI~," - I1.SC --> LLC - LF:x - B.LC 
LSC - Sm~v - RSC c> LLC - LEX - RLC 
where 
LSC = h.'ft surfiu:e context 
~ IJll I,' --- Sl lrface fortn 
I/.SC - riKht ranface context 
LLC = h'l't le.xical context 
LI,:x = lexical form 
I{LC = right lexical conte.xt 
The special symbol * indicates an empty context, which 
is always satisfied. The operator ~ states that lw, x 
'tttay sur\[itc.e, as StJIIF ill the g iven context ,  wh i le  the 
operator ?5 adds the condition that when LEx appears 
in the given context, then the surface description must 
satisfy S1HII.'. 'Phe later caters for obligatory rules. 
The advantage of this Rn'malism over others is that it 
allows inter alia mappings between lexical and surface 
strings of uneqmd lengths/! 
Rules 1- 3 can be expressed in this formalism as 
follows: a 
? -X -*  => * -X -*  (,l) 
? - - *  ~ * -+-*  (5) 
? - - *  <~ v -e -+ (6) 
Pulman and llepi)le proposed using the formalism 
for Arabic in the following manner: surface /k'utti5/ 
call be expressed with the r/lle:

conclude that their representation is closer I,o the lin-

4.1  A Mul t i -Tape  Two-Leve l  Mode l  
This work follows \[Kay 1987\] in using I;hree I, apes l))l" 
the lexical level: pat tern  tape  (PT), root  tal)e (liT) 
and voea l l sm tape  (VT), and <m<: sm'face, tape  (ST). 
Ill syntliesis, the lexical tapes are in read mode and the 
surface l;aI)e is in write mode; in recognil;ion, the op- 
posite state of affairs holds. One of the lexieal tapes 
is called the prhnary  lexieal  tape  (PILF) through 
wtfieh all lexical morphentes which fall out of the do- 
nlain of rool;-and-pattern morl>hology are passed (e.g. 
pretixes, sutlixes, I~artic:les, prepositi<ms). Since char: 
acters in P'.I' correspond to those on ST, P'F was chosen 
as PLT. 
There is linguisti<: SUl)pnrt for n lexical l.apes 
maI)l)ing to <)ne surface tape. As described })y 
\[McCarthy 1986\], when a word is uttered, it is pro- 
nounced in a linear string of segmmits (eorrespondinf,; 
to the linear ST in this model), i.e. the mult i -t ier rep- 
resentat io l l  is linearised. McCarthy ealls this process  
t ie r  eon l la t ion .  
4.2  A Mu l t i -Tape  Two-Leve l  Fornml- 
i sm 
The l 'u lnuul - Ih ;p l ) le / lhmss ink/ l l laek ct aL fornialisnl 
is adopted here with l;wo extensions. The first exten- 
sion is that all expressions in the lexical side of (.he 
rules (i.e. LLC, LBX and RLC) are n-tuple regular 
expressions of the form: 
( ;1~1)  ; i ;2 )  ? ? , ) "lT~'t) 
If a regular expression ignores all tapes lint Pl;I?, the 
parentheses can 1)e ignored; hence, (x) is the sanlt! ;ts :.): 
where x is on PIfF. l laving n-tuI)le lexical exI)r(!ssions 
and 1-tuple surface expression corresponds to having 
n-tapes on the lexieal level and one ()it the surface. 
The second extension is giving LI,C the ability to 
contain el l ipsis,  ... , which indicates the (ol)tional) 
omission li'om LLC of tvples, provided that the t.uples 
to tlt(: left o f . . .  are the first to apl>ear Oil {;h(! \]ell. of

In standard two-lew~l morphology we talk of feasilf le 
pairs .  Ilere we talk of feasib le tul i le  pa i rs  el the

(.",, :"':,..., :':,,) : (:'D 
For example, ll.ule 8 (see. I)elow) gives rise 1.o four fea- 
sible tul)le l)airs (C/, X, ):(X), 1 < i 5-4 4. The set of 
feasible tuple pairs is determined the same way as the 
set of feasible pairs in standard two-level gramniars. 
Now that  we have presented otir prol)osal , we are 
ready to aplily it, to the Aral)ic data of '1'ahh! I.

5.2  Voca l i sa t ion  
Orthographically, Semitic texts appear in three forms: 
eonsonanta l  texts  do not incorporate any w~wels but 
mattes lectionis ~, e.g. ktb for/katab/ (forln 1, active), 
/kutib/(form 1, passive) and/kutub/ 'books' ,  but kaatb 
for /kaatab/( form 3, active) and/kaat ib/ 'wr i ter ' ;  par- 
t ia l ly voeal lsed texts  incorporate some vowels to 
clarify ambiguity, e.g. kufl> for /kutib/ (form 1, pas- 
sive) to distinguish it fi'om /katab/ (form 1, active); 
and voeal lsed texts incorporate flfll vocalisation, e.g. 
st&tab (form 10, active). 
This phenomenon is taken care of by the following 
rules:  
* -  - *  a (x0 - (v ) - (x=, )  
X I , X2 -? vowel (12) 
, - - ,  ~ ( I ' , ,  x , ,  ) - (p,  , x )  - ( i~ ,  x~,  ) 
P (~ {vl,v2}, X = vowel, 
1",,1~ E {cl,c2,ea,c4}, 
XI, X2 = radical (13) 
R.ule 12 allows the omission of non-stmn vowels (i.e.. 
prefixes and suffixes). Rule 13 allows the omission of 
stern vowels. Note that the lexical contexts, LI,C and 
RLC, ensure that mattes lectionis are not omitted in 
the surface. Here is form Q3 with partial vocalisation 
on the surface.

One additional rule is required t<> allow the omis- 
sion of vowels which experience spreading (see Rule 17 
below). 
5.3  Geminat ion  and  Spread ing  
The only two phonological <:hanges ill the Arabic sl.em 
are gemination and spreading, e.g. /tukuttib/ (form

We define the following antomat, ou iul;o which rules can

A mul tL tape  f - register  auxi l iary  f in i te-state 
automaton  (AFSA) with n-tapes consists of: n read 
tapes and heads, a linite state control, and a read- 
write storage tape of length g, where f < w, and 
w is the length of the inlml; strings (of. APDA in 
\[I\]opcrofl. and Ulhmm 1979\]). The auLomal;on is illus- 
trated iu Fig. 5 (next page). I? 
In cme mow~, depending on the state of the finite 
control, along with the symbols scanned by the input 
aml storage heads, the AFSA may do any (n' all of the 
following:

'7 CON ( ' , LU ,q ION 
This lmpor has shown that  a. muld-  t:apo I;wo-lovol ap- 
proach using t:he Puhnan- I  \[eplflO/ILuessinl?/Bhtcl~ et al 
formalism with the. extensions ment ioned is capable of 
do.scribing the whole range of Arabic stems. 
Why do we need storage in the automata?  It is 
known that  ml automaton  with linito storage can bo 
rOl)laeed with a larger (me without storage (:t simt)le so- 
hd.i(m is i.o dui)licato l.he ma(:hino for each case); hence, 
18.q 
using finite storage (especially with g _< 1 and a small 
finite set of I') does not give the machine extra l)ower. 
The reason for using storage is to minimise the munher 
of machines and states. 
With regards to the implementat ion,  first we imple- 
mented a small system in order to test the usage of 
AFSTs in our model. Once this was estat)lished, we 
made a second implementat ion based on the work of 
\[Pulman and Hepple 1993\]. This iml)lementation dif- 
fers fi'om theirs as follows: Lexical expressions are n- 
tuples, i.e. implemented as l ists-of-l ists instead of lists- 
of-characters. A facility to check ellipsis in rules was 
added. The lexicon consists of multii)le trees, one tree 
per tape. Finally, a morphosyntact ic  pro:set was added. 
Wc conclude this paper by looking at the possil)ility 
of using our model for toiml hmguages. 
7.1 Beyond Semitic 
This approach may be capable of des(:rit)ing other types 
of non-l inear morphology, though we have not yet looked 
at a whole range, of examples. The following may form 
a theoretical franmwork for a number of non-l inear phe- 
nomena. 
Consider sui)rasegmental morphology in tonal lan- 
guages. Tense in Ngbal~% a language of Zaire, is in- 
dicated l)y tone, e.g. {kpolo} ' return'  gives Ikpat , ) /  
(Low) , /kpS ls / (M id) , /kpb l6 / (Low- I l igh) ,  and/kp61S/ 
(Iiigh) \[Nida 1949\]. This can be expressed with the 
stem nlorpheme. {lq)olo} on one tape and the tonal 
morphemes {L}, {M}, {LH} and {tI} on a second tape 
with the lbllowing rules: 
* -C -*  => * -C -*  (18) 
* -V -*  :~ * - -V -*  (:19) 
* -T - - *  ~:;, (V, ) - ( ,T ) - *  (20) 
where C is a consonant,  V is a vowel and T is a tonal 
segment (these rules are for the al)ove data only). The 
transit ions for /kpald/are shown below: 
F ig .  7 {kpolo) -I- {LII} 
~_VPV~ -_ 1 10  ~ St.era 
18 18 19 20 18 19 2(1 
For all other cases one needs to add a rule for spreading 
the tonal morpheme. 
7.2 Future Work 
Cmrent ly,  we are looking at descrihing tl,e Semitic 
stem using morak: \ [McCarthy and Prince 1990a\] and 
affixational \ [McCarthy 1992\] analyses of Semitic sLems. 
Another  area of interest is to look at the formal prop- 
erties of the formalism and of the AFSM.
