Abstract
The paper deals with the application of NLP
technology in e-learning. We report our re-
search on intelligent platforms for computer-
mediated education. Some of the methods de-
scribed in the paper have already taken part in
the end-user applications that are in everyday
use, others still wait for their implementation in
the form of software products. The main mes-
sage of the paper is that the language technol-
ogy, even in the imperfect form of the current
state of the art, can significantly enhance to-
day?s computer-mediated teaching and learning
activities. It is true especially for languages dif-
ferent from English, where the adopted learning
management systems often do not support even
the basic functionality of a language-oriented
search and retrieval of learning objects. As a
case study, this paper demonstrates the appli-
cation of the given ideas for e-learning materials
in Czech.
1 Introduction
Contemporary projects aiming at launching
learning management systems (LMS) often fo-
cus on the introduction of an existing software
tool, rather than on an innovation by means
of the modern information technologies. In ef-
fect, there is almost no original research di-
rected to the complex integration of e-learning
systems with the relevant IT such as assistive
technologies (dialogue systems, speech recog-
nition and synthesis . . . ), knowledge acquisi-
tion and knowledge management systems, etc.
Among others, the current LMS do not inte-
grate the emerging natural language processing
(NLP) applications. The adopted learning man-
agement systems often do not support even the
basic functionality of a language-oriented search
and retrieval of learning objects.
Futhermore, the present-day LMS are not di-
rectly linked to the wealth of relevant infor-
mation and knowledge sources. In the case of
the higher education institutions, these sources
could comprise standard libraries that provide
at least an electronic catalogue of their sources
nowadays, local digital libraries that are usu-
ally freely available for academics from particu-
lar institution, and the access to comprehensive
electronic archives or digital libraries that are
provided by many publishers and other organi-
zations on a commercial basis. Companies often
neglect valuable knowledge sources too. For ex-
ample, they should consider the integration of
their knowledge bases in the form of recorded
questions and answers from the call centers.
The current e-learning systems do not exploit
the potential of available high-level personaliza-
tion techniques and adaptability of the form,
the content and the access to the education.
Most of them cannot play the role of a show-
case for the modern teaching methods.
This paper surveys several areas, where NLP
techniques and technologies can enhance educa-
tional systems and applications. Some of them
exist in the form of prototypes only and have
not been applied in an end-user system yet.
Others find their place in software tools that
have been implemented by our team. They will
be briefly introduced in the paper.
The range of LMS used or tested at Masaryk
University, Brno, Czech Republic (MU) is
rather broad. The most important ones are IL-
IAS (http://www.ilias.uni-koeln.de/) and
MOODLE (http://moodle.org). Both sys-
tems are developed and distributed under the
term of the GNU General Public License and
provide open platform appropriate for the inte-
gration on NLP solutions. The actual project at
MU aims at unification of the used e-learning
platforms and their integration with the ad-
ministrative information server of the univer-
sity (Pavlovic et al, 2003). Even though sep-
arate systems would be more modular, easily
maintainable and extendable, we opt for the in-
tegrated solution that will benefit from the per-
manent technical support and personal assis-
tence of the administrative information server
team. We strongly believe that NLP techniques
as a part of the e-learning system can help to
open doors to those faculties and departments
that have not discovered the world of computer-
mediated education yet.
The paper discusses also the incorporation of
language resources to support the learner during
his/her interaction with an educational system
and to provide personalized learning. We also
tackle the use of NLP technologies and resources
to support the automatic assessment of learn-
ers? answers, especially those which are in free
text or restricted free text form. Such assess-
ment is useful to learners for controlling their
learning progress (self-regulation), to teachers
for gathering information about learners and
to systems for personalizing interaction. Con-
cept mapping is a knowledge elicitation tech-
nique, which stimulates learners to articulate
and synthesize their actual states of knowledge
during the learning process. We propose the
use of NLP in concept mapping systems in or-
der to interactively support learners, who build
concept maps and automate the process of the
assessment of concept maps. The availabil-
ity of wordnet-like semantic networks result-
ing from several projects such as EuroWord-
Net (Vossen, 1998), BalkaNet (BWN, 2004),
RussNet (Azarova, 2004), or broad-coverage on-
tologies such as SUMO (SUMO, 2003) provide
a reasonable starting point for such an effort.
The NLP applications in the area of e-
learning can be divided according to various cri-
teria. They can be specific for synchronous or
asynchronous mode of the course. The main
focus of the methods can be stressed to ad-
dress e.g. enhancements of the teaching ma-
terial accessibility or the adaptability of LMS.
Also the complexity of the needed NLP tech-
niques can make the distinctions, whether the
methods are already available and prepared to
integration into LMS or they need further de-
velopment. The availability of language re-
sources or language technology (lingware) for
the particular language can make the difference
too. A related issue can be the portability of
a solution for other languages or other subject
area, where subject-specific information cannot
be obtained fully automatically. One can also
divide the NLP applications in e-learning ac-
cording to the NLP modules that are integrated,
e.g. a language-specific morphological module
or named-entity analyzer could play a crucial
role. As the educational process has two faces
? learning and teaching, the boarder-line can
also be drawn between the tools focusing on the
students? side and those intended for the course
authors and teachers.
The last mentioned aspect has been taken
into account in this paper. It is organized as
follows: The next section discusses NLP tech-
niques aimed at enhancements for the end-users
of e-learning systems ? students looking for an
appropriate e-learning material or those who al-
ready enrolled in a course. The third section
tackles the support of authors and providers of
the e-learning facilities that can take the ad-
vantage of the language and text technology
too. Of course, the boundary between those two
cases is not strict at all, so there are NLP tools
that can help both types of LMS users. The
fourth section then covers supplementary in-
formation technologies such as multimedia and
audio- or video- recording of courses that can-
not be classified as NLP per se but are strongly
related and, as our experience already shows,
their integration should be at least coordinated
with the employment language technology solu-
tions. The paper concludes with future direc-
tions of our research.
2 NLP Support of LMS End-users
2.1 Basic Methods
Several standard NLP tools have been de-
veloped recently in Natural Language Pro-
cessing Laboratory, Faculty of Informatics
(NLPlab FI MU) that are beneficial for many
areas. E-learning is no exception in this respect.
The most important module is morphological
analyzer AJKA (Sedlacek and Smrz, 2001) that
serves as a base for various related modules.
The importance of the morphology for Czech
can be demonstrated by the history of the web
search engines in the Czech Republic. Czech is
a representative of Slavonic languages charac-
terized by abundance of inflective morphologi-
cal processes. For example, nouns, adjectives,
pronouns and numerals can be present in one of
7 grammatical cases in Czech (nominative, gen-
itive, dative, accusative, vocative, locative and
instrumental), three grammatical numbers (sin-
gular, plural and dual), and three genders (mas-
culine, feminine and neuter), in which masculine
exists in two forms - animate and inanimate.
The most popular Czech web portals started
with the search engine provided by Google, but
after a short time they replaced it by special-
ized language-aware systems developed usually
in cooperation with Czech universities.
The story shows that even generally recog-
nized implementations can be outrivaled, if they
ignore language-specific features. It holds not
only for web environment but also for the e-
learning. Projects implementing LMS need to
integrate strong language support and go be-
yond simple localization.
A lot of e-learning material has been pro-
duced in last years and the number grows as
many new courses are prepared in an electronic
form nowadays. One of the most important ap-
plications of AJKA is therefore the system that
enables search in the available e-learning ma-
terials. As the document source language and
the encoding are not always specified explicitly,
a text technology module ? language guesser
based on the language samples in a particular
encoding ? has been also implemented and in-
corporated into the e-learning search engine.
Another language resource that proved to be
very useful in our experiments is the query ex-
pansion module based on information from the
Czech WordNet (Pala and Smrz, 2004). The
crucial point here is the improvement of the user
interface. Users are able to search for all word
forms, synonyms, hypernyms and other seman-
tically related words, exclude co-hyponyms, etc.
They can also choose between orthographic, re-
gional, style or register variants, words derived
from the term searched, verbs related by the
aspect, etc.
Of course, even a stemmer or a simple lem-
matizer would suit the purpose of the search
engine. However, the strength of the full mor-
phological module becomes apparent when the
incorporation of deeper analyses of texts is the
issue. We currently work on a module that will
be able to summarize the content of related doc-
uments. The immediate target of the tool is the
summarization of messages in course discussion
groups. Sometimes, the students are very ac-
tive (the discussion is occasionally off-topic) and
even a simple browsing through the discussion
threads from previous runs of a course could
present a tedious work. The automatic extrac-
tion of the most important points can signifi-
cantly help newcomers.
Recently, we have added automatic classifica-
tion of e-learning materials into given categories
or at least clustering if there are no pre-defined
classes. Both ? learners and authors can take
advantage of these options but the role of self-
learning is stressed in the current version. The
function that proved to be most useful for e-
learning content is searching for documents sim-
ilar to a given course or an additional learn-
ing material. Inspired by the biggest dictionary
publishing servers, we will provide ?a new doc-
ument for this day? function and allow course
authors to specify what should be the pool of
searched documents. As there is currently an
e-learning project covering all our university,
we strongly believe that such functionality will
draw a broad attention to the new methods of
teaching and learning.
All the enhancements of the search for the
additional e-learning material mentioned above
are also applicable in the search for appropri-
ate courses. The method based on the statis-
tical tests known from the computational lin-
guistics is provided which enables the automatic
extraction of keywords that can be added to
those specified by course authors. The available
named-entity and multiword-expression analyz-
ers for Czech have found their place in this task.
The summarization module is applicable here
too as not all authors provide enough metadata
to facilitate searching courses or relevant parts
of them. An automatically generated index as
well as glossary or a small encyclopedia from a
comprehensive course enables non-linear pass-
ing through the learning material, which be-
comes a norm.
Another technique that enables students to
concentrate on the selected parts of a course
is the matching of the course content to the
student?s knowledge of a given topic. The
method applied to the matching is derived from
the standard assessment procedure for language
learners. As the task for the first assignment,
students are asked to write an essay covering
their current knowledge about the subject of the
course. The content of the document is com-
pared with the sections (lectures) of the given
course and the parts that are not covered suffi-
ciently are presented for further study.
The described approach can serve as the
launching point for the LMS personalization.
Some e-learning courses already contain special
mechanisms to offer a path through the teach-
ing material adapted to the needs of particular
user. Such an enhancement can improve the
acceptance of the content by users that often
face learning materials that are too in-depth in
some parts and too sketchy in others. Also,
the speed of presentation of the teaching ma-
terial can vary according to user needs. Besides
the above-mentioned assignment of essays, the
simple statistical technique has been adopted
that automatically evaluates the match of stu-
dents? answers and determines knowledge lev-
els of the students. The solution is now ready
to be applied generally to all e-learning courses
provided by MU. It can be generalized to allow
semi-automatic generation of tests for each part
of the subject matter that would ?send? stu-
dents (back) to the parts they should go through
again.
The presented adaptive components, which
adjust the system to particular users, are not
the only ones that we thought about and that
are covered in our e-learning environment. As
FI MU hosts centre Teiresias, which is responsi-
ble for helping students with special needs from
all departments of MU (http://www.muni.cz/
teiresias/), we focused also on the adaptation
of LMS for disabled. The activity of the center
is not limited to the electronic form of learning
but the context of the computer-mediated edu-
cation fits its pursuance perfectly. We currently
plan the first e-learning course that would be
fully available both in Czech and in Brail for
visually impaired people. The content different
from a plain text still presents a problem as it is
sometimes very difficult to find Brail equivalents
for mathematical expressions or various symbols
and it is always an extremely time-consuming
work.
We should also mention the role of the speech
synthesizer developed by our team that is avail-
able for the needs of visually impaired partici-
pants of the e-learning courses. The users are
able to help other students providing the pro-
nunciation of the words, which is not correctly
derived from its orthographical representation
by our automatic engine.
2.2 Question Answering and Exercise
Generation
The automatic question answering (QA) is an-
other task where the morphological as well as
surface syntactic analyses (Smrz and Horak,
2000) play the crucial role. We gain from our ex-
perience with ?Encyclopedia Expert? (Svoboda,
2002), which is able to answer free questions
based on the information extracted from an
available Czech encyclopedia. A set of semantic
frames and corresponding syntactic structures
is defined that enables analysis of the most fre-
quent question types. The rest of queries are
answered by the full-text search and the iden-
tification of the relevant part of the document
containing the answer. Both cases are based on
the question-type analysis module determining
what information should be looked for.
The employment of the same strategy in
the context of e-learning material is straight-
forward. The current system is able to ap-
ply the mechanisms described above to answer
questions based on the content of a particular
course. The information about the part of the
course, which contains the answer, can be also
returned. The evaluation of the QA module
showed that the precision on queries that can be
answered just on the content of a given course
is pretty high. Even for information not cov-
ered by the pre-defined frames (answered by the
full-text search) it was about 87 percent (errors
are mainly due to the incorrect or incomplete
analysis by the morphological module ? un-
known words). On the other hand, practical
assessment of the module showed that the de-
scribed functionality has only a limited use for
the course participants. Many students would
need and appreciate a search for answer in a
much broader range of relevant e-learning ma-
terials. Therefore, we are going to provide such
an option. Of course, the number of errors can
increase in such a setting and it will be the re-
sponsibility of the course author to check the
function of the QA module on the sources he
or she identified and to improve the results by
means of additional linguistic resources needed
in the analysis phase.
The promising results of automatic QA led
us to the idea to engage similar NLP methods
the other way around and automatically gen-
erate questions and perhaps whole tests based
on the content of particular e-learning courses.
It is usually easy to extract ?what is? ques-
tions or ask about a particular fact explicitly
stated in the text. Sometimes, the structure
of the documents itself helps to identify the
important knowledge; sometimes, the above-
mentioned keyword extraction algorithm can be
employed.
The tricky part of the process is therefore
to create a procedure that would be reliable
enough for the automatic checking of answers.
Again, the basic QA module is satisfactory for
the questions that expect factoid as the an-
swer. However, it is much more difficult to
automatically evaluate more elaborate answers.
Although we are not able to present final re-
sults for this part yet, the preliminary ones show
that the application of the same method as for
the comparison student essays with the content
could provide at least a good approximation of
the assessment that would be given by human
teachers.
The weak point of the described automatic
generator of exercises is its focus on the fac-
tography and impossibility to verify that stu-
dents really understand the content, that they
got the heart of the matter and are able to ap-
ply the obtained knowledge. Obviously, it is still
far from today, when computers will be able to
substitute human teachers in this respect. An
interesting step, that at least simulates such a
function and that is investigated by our current
experiments, is the employment of standard on-
tologies for this purpose. The interest in on-
tologies increased with the recognition of their
importance for the Semantic Web. The emerg-
ing information systems need the definition of
common understanding for their application do-
mains. Even though ontologies are meant as a
means providing human knowledge to machines,
they can be very useful for e-learning too. The
formal specification of the concepts and rela-
tions between them takes usually advantage of
the new XML-family standards, RDF (Beckett,
2003) and OWL (van Harmelen et al, 2003).
The latter serves as a base for our recent re-
search on the possibility to automatically gen-
erate exercise questions asking for relations be-
tween concepts given by an ontology. As the
number of available ontologies for various sub-
ject domains will surely increase this direction
of research has significant potential.
2.3 Language Learning
In our work we pay a special attention to NLP
methods applied in the area of language learning
and teaching. The role of empirical data in the
form of corpora ? large collections of written or
spoken language in the digital form ? is gener-
ally recognized in the computational linguistics.
Corpora are crucial for language learning too.
For example, the English courses taught at our
faculty bear on BNC (the British National Cor-
pus) and other available English corpora (e. g.
Times Corpus). The standard form of the vo-
cabulary test is automatically generated which
lists concordances of a word that is deleted from
all the presented occurrences and students have
to fill the gap.
Corpora are beneficial not only for generation
of queries. Students often use them as the pri-
mary source to learn about the usage of a word.
What complicates the process is the presence of
words students are not familiar with. Another
direction of our research that is currently un-
der development is the effort to sort the concor-
dance list according to the estimated complexity
of words in them. To be able to compute such
a measure efficiently even for extensive concor-
dance lists, the evaluation is based on heuristics
that take into account frequencies of the words
in the contexts.
New approach that will find its role in the
modern computer-mediated language learning
is the employment of the word sketch engine
described recently in (Kilgarriff et al, 2004).
Word sketches are brief automatic corpus-based
summaries of a word?s grammatical and colloca-
tional behavior. The sketch engine is a corpus
tool developed by our team which takes as input
a corpus of any language and a corresponding
grammar patterns and generates word sketches
for the words of that language as its outputs.
The most helpful feature of the system from
the language e-learning point of view are not
word sketches per se but the ability to auto-
matically compare sketches generated for dif-
ferent words. It is crucial especially for seman-
tically similar words, e.g. for near synonyms
or co-hyponyms. Students are able to com-
pare collocates and grammatical relations of the
words and the system can also automatically
generate tests checking whether learners know
the difference between semantically close words.
The word sketch engine also generates a the-
saurus that can be directly used in inspecting
the knowledge of a particular semantic field.
Correct answers are usually required to en-
ter next levels of a course. However, errors can
play a significant role too. A special attention
has been paid to the errors produced by stu-
dents in project Czenglish. It is a join project of
NLPlab FI MU and the Department of English
at the Faculty of Arts. The e-learning course is
based on popular book ?English or Czenglish?
which is intended for students of English at the
advanced or the professional levels. Students
produce translations of sentences presented by
the system. If a translation does not match a
stored one, the correct answers are displayed.
At the same time, the actual answer is com-
pared with the examples of listed incorrect ones.
If a match is found the explanation of the error
is presented. Students may also indicate, that
they still believe their translation is possible.
The message is sent to the teacher that has to
decide whether it should be added to the list of
correct answers. Such a decision automatically
affects the assessment of the student?s test.
3 NLP Techniques for Authors and
Teachers
3.1 Course Preparation
The quality of LMS raised enormously in last
decades. Students are able to work with e-
learning applications that are much more user-
friendly than some years ago. However, simulta-
neously with the quality increased the complex-
ity of the systems for content providers. To pre-
pare a good course, teachers need to learn how
to use the authoring system, how to determine
the possible passes through the material etc.
The authoring systems are usually linked to par-
ticular LMS. At least a basic understanding of
the technical stuff and e-learning standards be-
hind the particular LMS is often required. Our
experience clearly shows that text and language
technology can significantly help the e-learning
especially in the phase of course preparation and
is extremely beneficial for teachers.
The context analysis and the evaluation of
the similarity between a new e-learning con-
tent and the existing courses can be employed
to speed-up the process of course preparation.
We currently prepare an expert system that will
serve as an assistant for authors. The system
compares the provided content with the stored
courses and uses found similarities to propose
standard links (to additional materials, on-line
encyclopedias etc.) It also groups the possible
actions to enable authors to perform many nec-
essary actions at one-click. It is advantageous
especially for providing metadata for the learn-
ing objects that are understood as a must for
all the future e-learning content.
A course with a dense web of hyperlinks can
turn to be a nightmare for maintainers in a dy-
namic environment. To keep track of all the
links and relations between the e-learning con-
tent, a new system called DEB has been de-
signed and implemented by our team (Smrz
and Povolny, 2003). It is a client-server ap-
plication that enables efficient storage and re-
trieval of XML documents. Also complex struc-
tural and content queries can be defined. For
example, it is the main platform to host the
above-mentioned Czenglish project. It guaran-
tees that the whole content will stay consistent
when linked information is changed. The consis-
tency checks are defined as XSLT sheets (Clark,
1999) and the system reports any violation of
the predefined constraints.
The implemented mechanisms of XSLT trans-
formations are powerful enough to be inte-
grated in another important task of the cur-
rent LMS ? the support of open e-learning
standards. All new learning objects developed
at our faculty should be developed in such
a way to facilitate sharing and interchange.
As the field of LMS is rather hot and many
commercial as well as public-domain systems
emerged recently, the newly produced learning
object should also reflect the possibility of a
switch between platforms without an informa-
tion loss. The currently developed authoring
module defines XSLT transformations of the
primary document (DocBook-like (Walsh and
Muellner, 1999)) format into LOM/SCORM
compliant forms. It could help to put the plat-
form independent standards into wide use.
3.2 Course Run
The support to teachers during the run of
courses is at least equally important as in the
phase of the content preparation. It is true es-
pecially if a course has already run several times
and the feed-back from the previous runs should
be reflected in the actual one. The current sys-
tems usually ignore the possibility to reflect the
experience from the past years. The students?
answers, either correct or incorrect, are often
thrown away or used just for elementary statisti-
cal profiles. One of the most valuable resources
is frequently neglected.
The results of our recent research reveal
that the detailed analysis of the students? out-
puts offers an extremely useful material di-
rectly applicable in the optimization of the e-
learning content. For example, special tools
have been developed for tagging and categoriz-
ing the grammatical and stylistic errors in stu-
dent essays (Pala et al, 2003). Teachers mark
the errors in the electronic documents. Students
have to correct them in the new version but also
to record the original (incorrect) form and the
error type. The files in the source format (usu-
ally MS Word or LaTeX) are transformed into
an appropriate XML format. A special form of
a learner corpus has been developed that serves
as a base for focusing the teaching in a spe-
cial course. As a side effect, the created re-
source is used to develop the Czech grammar
checker (Smrz and Horak, 1999) which will be
the first one based on the large empirical data.
The attempts to make the assessment of stu-
dent knowledge as objective as possible and to
reduce the teacher?s work led to the spread
of multi-choice tests in last decades. It is a
well-known fact that this form of testing has
many disadvantages too and that the focus
on them can easily produce test-experts rather
than people understanding the subject. The
current technology offers various means to im-
plement intelligent tests and to escape the trap
of multi-choice tests. Our current research con-
centrates on the integration of NLP techniques
into the evaluation module of LMS. The expe-
rience shows that it is relatively easy to provide
such functionality for short answers in the form
of phrases described by simple grammatical pat-
terns. The results of the first limited experi-
ment are very promising as the method reduced
the number of answers that needed to be pro-
cessed manually significantly (only 31 % of the
cases remained for the manual check). However,
there are also many open questions concerning
scaling-up the method of the answer patterns.
The longer the answers are, the less matches be-
tween the pre-defined applications are found. A
more general solution of the analyzing mecha-
nism in the form of a general grammar is ob-
viously needed. However, the available gram-
mar for Czech is developed for a robust ana-
lyzer so the ambiguity of the analysis tends to
be rather high. Also it is much more difficult
for authors that do not specialize in the com-
putational linguistics to define the acceptable
forms of answers. The assessment of open ques-
tions is definitively one of the actual topics of
our research.
Although the current state-of-the-art in NLP
does not allow full computerization of the as-
sessment of general tests, there are areas, where
the technology can already take over the role
traditionally falling upon the teacher. We have
recently implemented the automatic evaluation
of programs in the Java programming course at
FI MU and also the phrase-structure grammars
developed by students of the ?Introduction to
the computational linguistics?. Students are
obliged to provide their assignments in the des-
ignated form. Pre-defined tests are applied to
verify the correctness of the provided solutions.
We are to provide a similar function for a gram-
matical pre-checking of students? essays. Even
though only a limited number of error types can
be identified automatically, the method can still
reduce a significant portion of the tedious teach-
ers? work.
3.3 Additional Functions
The previous section discussed how the stan-
dard NLP methods can help students to search
in the e-learning data. The same technique
can be integrated into the LMS authoring sub-
system. Especially, the tedious linking of the
additional course sources can be facilitated by
NLP. We have designed and implemented a sys-
tem which automatically finds relevant articles
and papers available for the students of our fac-
ulty or the university (digital libraries provided
by ACM and Springer-Verlag), freely accessi-
ble on the web (www.arxiv.gov, ResearchIndex)
or that are at readers? disposal at the faculty
libraries. The experience shows that the per-
sonalization of the application interface is per-
haps even more important for authors than for
students. Too complex environment can scare
off and discourage some authors, others call for
more functions and more possibilities to deter-
mine the behavior of the search engine.
Many e-learning courses have been recently
created all over the world; many of them are
available for the general public via Internet now.
Most of the resources are written in English. It
is sometimes impossible to take directly the for-
eign version, at least a part of the content needs
to be translated. The NLP technology known
as translation memory finds its place here. The
motivation of the application of the translation
memories is the same as in the common local-
ization of software. If the content of the e-
course will be modified and a new version be-
comes available, the ?memory? of the tool will
help to translate parts that remain the same or
changed in a limited extent only. Our experi-
ence of the localization based on DejaVu soft-
ware (Dej, 2003) is rather positive as it enabled
to ?upgrade? our English-Czech translation in
just a week.
The last piece of software that will be men-
tioned here is the experimental plagiarism iden-
tifier. Very simple methods comparing word n-
grams showed to be efficient and precise enough
to identify plagiarism in cases where both the
original and the derived document are in one
language (Czech). However, teachers often find
essay that are word-for-word translations of an
original text. A reliable automatic identification
of such cases is difficult as the n-gram methods
could not provide reasonable precision due to
the difference of the syntactical structures be-
tween Czech and English. This kind of checking
forms another direction of our future research.

4.1 Service-Oriented Architecture for
E-learning
A typical LMS is constructed as a monolithic
piece of software or a set of tools fully integrated
into another system such as administrative in-
formation system. The first really open systems
able to communicate with the environment via
platform-independent channels emerged in the
area of LMS only recently. The long-term goal
of our research is to provide NLP solutions for
LMS via open technologies in the heterogeneous
systems. The form of web services seems to be
appropriate for the task.
Generally speaking, our view is based on the
idea of the service oriented architecture. This
emerging approach assumes that software ap-
plications implement only functions specific for
their tasks, while more general functions are im-
plemented as services available on the net.
If a method can be provided as a web ser-
vice, it immediately evokes the idea of ?out-
sourcing?. A standard task in the prepara-
tion of learning courses is the search for addi-
tional material, its indexing and linking to the
primary course texts. As has been presented
above, NLP can offer supplementary functions,
such as automatic question answering. How-
ever, as has been also shown, the preparation of
necessary resources used in the analysis needs
detailed knowledge about the way a particu-
lar NLP techniques work. One reason for the
outsourcing lies therefore in the effort to en-
able users to focus on the content of e-learning
courses only and to provide other services exter-
nally (free of charge or on a commercial basis).
To motivate the other reason, let us share the
experience of the processing large corpora. The
above-mentioned word sketch engine needs sev-
eral hours to compute the necessary statistics on
a 100,000-word corpus (BNC). The implemen-
tation takes advantage of the available powerful
PC workstations. To process a 1-billion cor-
pus in the same time, we would need a super-
computer to perform the task. However, such a
computer would be idle almost all the time in
our laboratory. It is much easier and cheaper
to ?hire? the computing power needed for the
processing.
Many modern NLP methods are based on
large language corpora (hundreds thousands of
words) and lexical databases (e.g. Princeton
WordNet (Miller et al, 1990) contains more
than 200,000 lexical units and their relations).
High-speed networks and Grid systems are very
important in this context as they enable to
transfer the processing of resource-demanding
tasks such as the creation of indices for large
collections of data to the available powerful sys-
tems. Such systems can moreover benefit from
the analysis of various corpora. Such tasks can
be fully outsourced without an allocation of own
capacity ? in terms of efficiency as well as lan-
guage resources.
The described approach is one of the most
actual directions of the integration of NLP and
the Semantic Web. It is studied at FI MU espe-
cially as a part of the recently proposed project
combining e-learning and the Grid technologies.
We propose to integrate and evaluate services
based on the new specification WSRF (Web Ser-
vice Resource Framework) that defines a unify-
ing view at the web and Grid services.
4.2 E-learning and Multimedia Support
The modern e-learning courses are often supple-
mented by a multimedia data. It can range of
a simple recorded audio from the lecture to the
full video recording and its streaming with in-
tegrated switching between the shots of the lec-
turer and his/her presentation. A recent topic
we are working on deals with the software tools
that can facilitate the preparation of such an
e-learning material. One of the most impor-
tant current issues is the research on the col-
laboration between LMS and the development
platforms for multimedia applications (Author-
ware (Aut, 2004) in our case).
Processing and indexing the multimedia con-
tent is another large issue. We currently pre-
pare a new methodology to link the presenta-
tion with the lecture recording. We also per-
formed the first experiments aiming at the eval-
uation of automatic linking of the presentation
content to the recording by means of automatic
speech recognition. The obtained unsatisfac-
tory results influence the changes in the record-
ing setting with the aim to improve the acoustic
quality of the recording. We would like to define
a universal methodology applicable also outside
the university.
The next priority of our research is the shared
teaching. A pilot course with shared parts of se-
lected lectures transmitted between two distant
sites (Prague and Brno) will run in the next
semester. The experience with the teleconfer-
encing will surely be a helpful for this task, espe-
cially the verified camera tracking mechanisms.
FI MU is also active in the field of streaming the
lecture recordings via the high-speed networks.
5 Conclusions
The broader context of all the research de-
scribed in the paper is given by the common e-
learning strategy built by several leading univer-
sities in the Czech Republic. The initiative in-
cludes the support for choosing LMS platform,
study of the standards in the area, publishing
good practices for e-learning materials and the
new forms of education, etc. The incorporation
of NLP techniques to extend the functionality
of the current LMS becomes one of the primary
action lines in the program.
The experience gained by some faculties at
MU as well as of other cooperating institu-
tions demonstrates that preparation and pro-
viding of the e-learning courses can generate
significant profit. It holds not only for commer-
cial providers but also for the universities (dis-
tant learning courses). Moreover, the idea of
computer-mediated education is in accord with
the long-term aim to internationalize the uni-
versities in the Czech Republic. The described
NLP techniques and other modern approaches
help to open the institutions to students from
all over the world.
