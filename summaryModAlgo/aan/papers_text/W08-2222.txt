Abstract
Boxer is an open-domain software component for semantic analysis of
text, based on Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) and Discourse
Representation Theory (DRT). Used together with the C&C tools, Boxer
reaches more than 95% coverage on newswire texts. The semantic repre-
sentations produced by Boxer, known as Discourse Representation Struc-
tures (DRSs), incorporate a neo-Davidsonian representations for events,
using the VerbNet inventory of thematic roles. The resulting DRSs can
be translated to ordinary first-order logic formulas and be processing by
standard theorem provers for first-order logic. Boxer?s performance on
the shared task for comparing semantic represtations was promising. It
was able to produce complete DRSs for all seven texts. Manually in-
specting the output revealed that: (a) the computed predicate argument
structure was generally of high quality, in particular dealing with hard
constructions involving control or coordination; (b) discourse structure
triggered by conditionals, negation or discourse adverbs was overall cor-
rectly computed; (c) some measure and time expressions are correctly
analysed, others aren?t; (d) several shallow analyses are given for lexical
phrases that require deep analysis; (e) bridging references and pronouns
are not resolved in most cases. Boxer is distributed with the C&C tools
and freely available for research purposes.

1 Introduction
Boxer is an open-domain tool for computing and reasoning with semantic represen-
tations. Based on Discourse Representation Theory (Kamp and Reyle, 1993), Boxer
is able to construct Discourse Representation Structures (DRSs for short, informally
called ?boxes? because of the way they are graphically displayed) for English sen-
tences and texts. There is a translation from DRSs to first-order formulas, which
opens the way to perform inference by including automated reasoning tools such as
theorem provers and model builders (Blackburn and Bos, 2005).
2 Theory
2.1 Combinatory Categorial Grammar
As a preliminary to semantics, we need syntax. Boxer implements a syntax-semantics
interface based on Combinatory Categorial Grammar, CCG (Steedman, 2001). CCG
lends itself extremely well for this task because it is lexically driven and has only few
?grammar? rules, and not less because of its type-transparency principle, which says
that each syntactic type (a CCG category) corresponds to a unique semantic type (a
lambda-expression). Because the syntax-semantics is clearly defined, the choice of
logical form can be independent of the categorial framework underlying it. Steedman
uses simple predicate argument structures expressed via the untyped lambda calculus
to illustrate the construction of logical forms in CCG (Steedman, 2001). We instead
opt for Discourse Representation Theory, a widely accepted sophisticated formal the-
ory of natural language meaning dealing with a large variety of semantic phenomena.
2.2 Discourse Representation Theory
DRT is a formal semantic theory originally designed by Kamp to cope with anaphoric
pronouns and temporal relations (Kamp, 1981). DRT uses an explicit intermediate
semantic representation, called DRS (Discourse Representation Structure), for deal-
ing with anaphoric or other contextually sensitive linguistic phenomena such as ellip-
sis and presupposition. We choose DRT because it has established itself as a well-
documented formal theory of meaning, covering a number of semantic phenomena
ranging from pronouns, abstract anaphora, presupposition, tense and aspect, proposi-
tional attitudes, to plurals (Kamp and Reyle, 1993; Asher, 1993; Van der Sandt, 1992).
In terms of expressive power, three different kinds of representations are distin-
guished in Boxer:
1. Discourse Representation Structures (DRSs)
2. Underspecified DRSs (DRSs + merge + alfa)
3. ?-DRSs (UDRSs + lambda + application)
DRSs are the representations corresponding to natural language sentences or texts.
This is the core DRT language compatible with first-order logic. The DRS language
employed by Boxer is a subset of the one found in Kamp and Reyle (1993). We define
the syntax of DRSs below with the help of Backus-Naur form, where non-terminal
symbols are enclosed in angle brackets. The non-terminal <ref> denotes a discourse
referent, and <symn> an n-place predicate symbol.

<expt> ::= <drs>
<drs> ::=
<ref>?
<condition>?
<condition> ::= <basic> |
<complex>
<basic> ::= <sym1>(<expe>) |
<sym2>(<expe>,<expe>) |
<named>(<expe>,<nam>,<sort>)
<complex> ::= ?<expt> |
<expt>?<expt> |
<expt>?<expt> |
<ref>:<expt>
DRSs are structures comprising two parts: 1) a set of discourse referents; and 2) a
set of conditions constraining the interpretation of the discourse referents. Conditions
can be simple properties of discourse referents, express relations between them, or be
complex, introducing (recursively) subordinated DRSs.
The standard version of DRT formulated in Kamp & Reyle incorporates a David-
sonian event semantics (Kamp and Reyle, 1993), where discourse referents can also
stand for events and be referred to by anaphoric expressions or constrained by tem-
poral relations. The neo-Davidsonian system, as implemented in Boxer, uses the in-
ventory of roles proposed by VerbNet (Kipper et al, 2008), and has some attractive
formal properties (Dowty, 1989). There is only one way to state that an individual is
participating in an event?namely by relating it to the event using a binary relation
expressing some thematic role. Furthermore, the approach clearly distinguishes the
participants of an event by the semantic roles they bear. Finally, it also allows us to
characterize the meaning of thematic roles independently of the meaning of the verb
that describes the event.
We won?t show the standard translation from DRS to FOL here (Blackburn et al,
2001; Bos, 2004; Kamp and Reyle, 1993). Intuitively, translating DRSs into first-order
formulas proceeds as follows: each discourse referent is translated as a first-order
quantifier, and all DRS-conditions are translated into a conjunctive formula of FOL.
Discourse referents usually are translated to existential quantifiers, with the exception
of those declared in antecedents of implicational DRS-conditions, that are translated
as universal quantifiers. Obviously, negated DRSs are translated as negated formulas,
disjunctive DRSs as disjunctive formulas, and implicational DRSs as formulas with
material implication.
Boxer outputs either resolved semantic representations (in other words, completely
disambiguated DRSs), or underspecified representations, where some ambiguities are
left unresolved in the semantic representation. This level of representation is referred
to as underspecified DRS, or UDRS for short. It is a small extension of the DRS
language given in the previous section and is defined as follows:
<expt> ::= <udrs>
<udrs> ::= <drs> | (<expt>;<expt>) | (<expt>?<expt>)
Note here that expressions of type t are redefined as UDRSs. UDRSs are either
ordinarly DRSs, DRSs conjoined by the merge (for which we use the semicolon), or

binatory rules are indicated by solid lines, semantic rules by dotted lines.
DRS composed by the ?-operator. The merge conjoins two DRSs into a larger DRS
? semantically the merge is interpretated as (dynamic) logical conjunction. Merge-
reduction is the process of eliminating the merge operation by forming a new DRS
resulting from the union of the domains and conditions of the argument DRSso of
a merge, respectively (obeying certain constraints). Figure 1 illustrates the syntax-
semantics interface (and merge-reduction) for a derivation of a simple noun phrase.
Boxer adopts Van der Sandt?s view as presupposition as anaphora (Van der Sandt,
1992), in which presuppositional expressions are either resolved to previously estab-
lished discourse entities or accommodated on a suitable level of discourse. Van der
Sandt?s proposal is cast in DRT, and therefore relatively easy to integrate in Boxer?s
semantic formalism. The ?-operator indicates information that has to be resolved in
the context, and is lexically introduced by anaphoric or presuppositional expressions.
A DRS constructed with ? resembles the proto-DRS of Van der Sandt?s theory of pre-
supposition (Van der Sandt, 1992) although they are syntactically defined in a slightly
different way to overcome problems with free and bound variables, following Bos
(2003). Note that the difference between anaphora and presupposition collapses in
Van der Sandt?s theory.
The types are the ingredients of a typed lambda calculus that is employed to con-
struct DRSs in a bottom-up fashion, compositional way. The language of lambda-
Wide-Coverage Semantic Analysis with Boxer 281
DRSs is an extension of the language of (U)DRS defined before:
<expe> ::= <ref> | <vare>
<expt> ::= <udrs> | <vart>
<exp?> ::= (<exp??,??> @ <var?>) | <var?>
<exp??,??> ::= ?<var?>.<exp?> | <var??,??>
Hence we define discourse referents as expressions of type e, and DRSs as expres-
sions of type t. We use @ to indicate function application, and the ?-operator to bind
free variables over which we wish to abstract.
3 Practice
3.1 Preprocessing
The input text needs to be tokenised with one sentence per line. In the context of this
paper, Boxer was put into action after using a combined processing pipeline of the
C&C tools consisting of POS-tagging, named entity recognition, and parsing (Curran
et al, 2007). The POS tags are used to specify the lexical semantics for ambigu-
ous CCG categories (see below); the named entity tags are transferred to the level of
DRSs as well and added as sorts to named discourse referents. An example of a CCG
derivation is shown in Figure 2.

3.2 Lexicon
In CCG, the syntactic lexicon comprises the set of lexical categories. CCGbank hosts
more than a thousand different categories. The semantic lexicon defines a suitable
mapping from categories to semantic representations. In the context of Boxer, these
semantic representations are defined in the shape of lambda-DRSs. Boxer implements
almost all categories employed by the C&C parser, which is a subset of the ones found
in CCGbank, leaving out extremely rare cases for the sake of efficiency.
Defining the lexical semantics cannot always be done solely on the basis of the
category, for one lexical category could give rise to several different semantic inter-
pretations. So we need to take other resources into account, such as the assigned part
of speech (PoS), and sometimes the wordform or named entity type associated with
the category. For the majority of categories, in particular those that correspond to
282 Bos
open-class lexical items, we also need access to the morphological root of the word
that triggered the lexical category.
Although there is a one-to-one mapping between the CCG categories and semantic
types ? and this must be the case to ensure the semantic composition process pro-
ceeds without type clashes ? the actual instantiations of a semantic type can differ
even within the scope of a single CCG category. For example, the category n/n can
correspond to an adjective, a cardinal expression, or even common nouns and proper
names (in the compound expressions). In the latter two cases the lexical entry intro-
duces a new discourse referent, in the former two it does not. To account for this
difference we also need to look at the part of speech that is assigned to a token.
3.3 Resolution
Boxer implements various presupposition triggers introduced by noun phrases, includ-
ing personal pronouns, possessive pronouns, reflexive pronouns, emphasising pro-
nouns, demonstrative pronouns, proper names, other-anaphora, definite descriptions.
In addition, some aspects of tense are implemented as presupposition triggers, too.
Anaphora and presupposition resolution takes place in a separate stage after build-
ing up the representation, following the resolution algorithm outlined in Bos (2003).
The current implementation of Boxer aims at high precision in resolution: personal
pronouns are only attempted to be resolved to named entities, definite descriptions
and proper names are only linked to previous discourse referents if there is overlap in
the DRS-conditions of the antencedent DRS and alpha-DRS. If no suitable antecedent
can be found, global accommodation of the anaphoric discourse referent and condi-
tions will take palce.
Because Boxer has the option to output unresolved DRSs too, it is possible to in-
clude external anaphora or coreference resolution components.
3.4 Example Analysis
We illustrate the capabilities of Boxer with the following example text shown below
(aka as Text 2 of the shared task).1 The text consists of three sentences, the second be-
ing a coordinated sentence. It contains a passive construction, three pronouns, relative
clauses, control verbs, and a presupposition trigger other.
Text 2
Cervical cancer is caused by a virus. That has been known for some time
and it has led to a vaccine that seems to prevent it. Researchers have been
looking for other cancers that may be caused by viruses.
The output of Boxer for this text is shown in Figure 3. Only the box format is shown
here? Boxer is also able to output the DRSs in Prolog or XML encodings. It was run
without analysing tense and aspect and without discourse segmentation (both of these
are possible in Boxer, but still undergo development, and are therefore disregarded
here).
As we can see from the example and Boxer?s analysis various things go right and
various things go wrong. Boxer deals fine with the passive construction (assigned the
1This text was taken from the Economist Volume 387 Number 8582, page 92. The third sentence has
been simplified.
Wide-Coverage Semantic Analysis with Boxer 283
appropriate semantic role), the relative clauses, and the control construction (vaccine
is the agent of the prevent event). It also handles the presupposition trigger anaphori-
cally linking the mention of other cancers in the third sentence with the phrase cervi-
cal cancer in the first sentence, and asserting an inequality condition in the DRS.
Boxer failed to resolve three pronouns correctly. These are all accommodated at
the global level of DRS, which is the DRS on the left-hand side in Figure 3. All of the
pronouns have textual antecedents: the abstract pronoun that in the second sentence
refers to the fact declared in the first sentence. The first occurrence of it in the second
sentence also seems to refer to this fact? the second occurrence of it refers to cervical
cancer mentioned in the first sentence.

4 Performance on Shared Task
Here we discuss the output of Boxer on the Shared Task Texts (Bos, 2008). Boxer was
able to produce semantic representation for all text without any further modifications
to the software. For each text we briefly say what was good and bad about Boxer?s
analysis. (We won?t comment on the performance on the second text, as this is the
text proposed by ourselves and already discussed in the previous section.)
Text 1: An object is thrown with a horizontal speed ...
Good: The resulting predicate argument structure was fine overall, including a diffi-
cult control construction (?how long does it take the object to fall ...?). The definite
description ?the object? was correctly resolved. The conditional got correctly anal-
ysed.
Bad: The measure phrase ?125 m high? got mis-interpreted as noun-noun comn-
pound. The definite description ?the fall? was not linked to the falling event mentioned
before.
Comments: Because there were two questions in this text we parsed it using the
C&C parser with the model trained on questions.
284 Bos
Text 3: John went into a restaurant ...
Good: The pronouns were correctly resolved to the proper name ?John? rather than
?the waiter?, even though this is based on the simple strategy in Boxer to link third-
person pronouns to named entities of type human. The coordination construction
?warm and friendly? got correctly analysed (distributively), and the control construc-
tion ?began to read his book? received a proper predicate argument structure.
Bad: Boxer doesn?t deal with bridging references introduced by relational nouns, so
expressions like ?the corner? were not linked to other discourse entities.
Text 4: The first school for the training of leader dogs ...
Good: The named entities were correctly recognised and classified (locations and
proper names). The VP coordination in the first and later sentences was correctly
analysed. The expression ?this school? got correctly linked to the schhol mentioned
earlier in the text. The time expression ?1999? got the right interpretation.
Bad: The adjectives/determiners ?first? and ?several? didn?t receive a deep analysis.
The complex NP ?Joao Pedro Fonseca and Marta Gomes? was distributively inter-
preted, rather than collective. The pronoun ?they? wasn?t resolved. The preposition
?In? starting the second sentence was incorrectly analysed by the parser.
Text 5: As the 3 guns of Turret 2 were being loaded ...
Good: The discourse structures invoked by the sentence initial adverbs ?As? and
?When? was correctly computed. Predicate argument structure overall good, includ-
ing treatment of the relative clauses. The expression ?the propellant? was correctly
resolved. Time expressions in the one but last sentence got a correct analysis.
Bad: The name ?Turret 2? was incorrectly analysed (not as a compound). The ad-
verbs ?yet? and ?then? got a shallow analysis. The first-person pronoun ?I? was not
resolved to the crewman.
Comments: The quotes were removed in the tokenisation phase, because the C&C
parser, being trained on a corpus without quotes, performs badly on texts containing
quotes.
Text 6: Amid the tightly packed row houses of North Philadelphia ...
Good: The named entities were correctly recognised and classified as locations. The
various cases of VP coordination all got properly analysed. The numerical and date
expressions got correct representations.
Bad: The occurrences of the third-person neuter pronouns were not resolved. The
preposition ?Amid? was not correctly analysed.
Text 7: Modern development of wind-energy technology and applications ...
Good: Correct interpretation of time expressions ?1930s? and ?1970s?. Correct pred-
icate argument structure overall.
Bad: ?Modern? was recognised as a proper name. The noun phrase ?wind-energy
technology and applications? was distributively analysed with ?wind-energy? only ap-
plying to ?technology?. The sentence-initial adverb ?Since? did not introduce proper
discourse structure. The units of measurement in the last two sentences were not
Wide-Coverage Semantic Analysis with Boxer 285
recognised as such. The tricky time expression ?mid-80?s? only got a shallow inter-
pretation.
5 Conclusion
Boxer is a wide-coverage system for semantic interpretation. It takes as input a CCG
derivation of a natural language expression, and produces formally interpretable se-
mantic representations: either in the form of DRSs, or as formulas of first-order
logic. The existence of CCGbank (Hockenmaier, 2003) and robust parsers trained
on it (Clark and Curran, 2004; Bos et al, 2004) make Boxer a state-of-the-art open-
domain tool for deep semantic analysis.
Boxer?s performance on the shared task for comparing semantic represtations was
promising. It was able to produce DRSs for all texts. We can?t quantify the quality
of Boxer?s output, as we don?t have gold standard representations at our disposal.
Manually inspecting the output gives us the following impression:
? computed predicate argument structure is generally of good quality, including
hard constructions involving control or coordination;
? discourse structure triggered by conditionals, negation or discourse adverbs is
overall correctly computed;
? some measure and time expressions are correctly analysed, others aren?t;
? several shallow analyses are given for lexical phrases that require deep analysis;
? bridging references and pronouns are not resolved in most cases; but when they
are, they are mostly correctly resolved (high precision at the cost of recall).
Finally, a comment on availability of Boxer. All sources of Boxer are available for
download and free of non-commercial use. It is distributed with the C&C tools for
natural language processing (Curran et al, 2007), which are hosted on this site:
