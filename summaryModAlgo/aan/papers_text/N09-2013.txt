Automatically detecting dialogue structure within corpora of human-human dialogue is the subject of increasing attention.  In the do-main of tutorial dialogue, automatic discovery of dialogue structure is of particular interest because these structures inherently represent tutorial strategies or modes, the study of which is key to the design of intelligent tutor-ing systems that communicate with learners through natural language.  We propose a methodology in which a corpus of human-human tutorial dialogue is first manually an-notated with dialogue acts.  Dependent adja-cency pairs of these acts are then identified through ?2 analysis, and hidden Markov mod-eling is applied to the observed sequences to induce a descriptive model of the dialogue structure.       
1 Introduction Automatically learning dialogue structure from corpora is an active area of research driven by a recognition of the value offered by data-driven ap-proaches (e.g., Bangalore et al, 2006).  Dialogue structure information is of particular importance when the interaction is centered around a learning task, such as in natural language tutoring, because techniques that support empirical identification of dialogue strategies can inform not only the design of intelligent tutoring systems (Forbes-Riley et al, 2007), but also contribute to our understanding of 
the cognitive and affective processes involved in learning through tutoring (VanLehn et al, 2007).        Although traditional top-down approaches (e.g., Cade et al, 2008) and some empirical work on analyzing the structure of tutorial dialogue (Forbes-Riley et al, 2007) have yielded significant results, the field is limited by the lack of an auto-matic, data-driven approach to identifying dialogue structure.  An empirical approach to identifying tutorial dialogue strategies, or modes, could ad-dress this limitation by providing a mechanism for describing in succinct probabilistic terms the tuto-rial strategies that actually occur in a corpus.      Just as early work on dialogue act interpretation utilized hidden Markov models (HMMs) to capture linguistic structure (Stolcke et al, 2000), we pro-pose a system that uses HMMs to capture the structure of tutorial dialogue implicit within se-quences of already-tagged dialogue acts.  This ap-proach operates on the premise that at any given point in the tutorial dialogue, the collaborative in-teraction is in a dialogue mode that characterizes the nature of the exchanges between tutor and stu-dent.  In our model, a dialogue mode is defined by a probability distribution over the observed sym-bols (e.g., dialogue acts and adjacency pairs).      Our previous work has noted some limitations of first-order HMMs as applied to sequences of individual dialogue acts (Boyer et al, in press).  Chief among these is that HMMs allow arbitrarily frequent transitions between hidden states, which does not conform well to human intuition about how tutoring strategies are applied.  Training an HMM on a sequence of adjacency pairs rather than individual dialogue acts is one way to generate a 
49
more descriptive model without increasing model complexity more than is required to accommodate the expanded set of observation symbols.  To this end, we apply the approach of Midgley et al (2006) for empirically identifying significant adja-cency pairs within dialogue, and proceed by treat-ing adjacency pairs as atomic units for the purposes of training the HMM.   2 Corpus Analysis This analysis uses a corpus of human-human tuto-rial dialogue collected in the domain of introduc-tory computer science.  Forty-three learners interacted remotely with a tutor through a key-board-to-keyboard remote learning environment yielding 4,864 dialogue moves.    The tutoring corpus was manually tagged with dialogue acts designed to capture the salient char-acteristics of the tutoring process (Table 1).  Tag Act Example Q Question Where should I  declare i? EQ Evaluation Question How does that look? S Statement You need a  closing brace. G Grounding Ok.  EX Extra-Domain You may use  your book. PF Positive Feedback Yes, that?s right. LF Lukewarm Feedback Sort of. NF Negative Feedback No, that?s not right. Table 1. Dialogue Act Tags  The correspondence between utterances and dia-logue act tags is one-to-one.  Compound utterances (i.e., a single utterance comprising more than one dialogue act) were split by the primary annotator prior to the inter-rater reliability study.1      The importance of adjacency pairs is well-established in natural language dialogue (e.g., Schlegoff & Sacks, 1973), and adjacency pair analysis has illuminated important phenomena in tutoring as well (Forbes-Riley et al, 2007).  For the current corpus, bigram analysis of dialogue acts yielded a set of commonly-occurring pairs.  How-ever, as noted in (Midgley et al, 2006), in order to                                                            1 Details of the study procedure used to collect the corpus, as well as Kappa statistics for inter-rater reliability, are reported in (Boyer et al, 2008). 
establish that two dialogue acts are truly related as an adjacency pair, it is important to determine whether the presence of the first member of the pair is associated with a significantly higher prob-ability of the second member occurring.  For this analysis we utilize a ?2 test for independence of the categorical variables acti and acti+1 for all two-way combinations of dialogue act tags.  Only pairs in which speaker(acti)?speaker(acti+1) were consid-ered.  Other dialogue acts were treated as atomic elements in subsequent analysis, as discussed in Section 3.  Table 2 displays a list of the dependent pairs sorted by descending (unadjusted) statistical significance; the subscript indicates tutor (t) or stu-dent (s).  acti acti+1 P(acti+1|       acti) P(acti+1|    ?acti) ?2 val p-val EQs PFt 0.48 0.07 654 <0.0001 Gs Gt 0.27 0.03 380 <0.0001 EXs EXt 0.34 0.03 378 <0.0001 EQt PFs 0.18 0.01 322 <0.0001 EQt Ss 0.24 0.03 289 <0.0001 EQs LFt 0.13 0.01 265 <0.0001 Qt Ss 0.65 0.04 235 <0.0001 EQt LFs 0.07 0.00 219 <0.0001 Qs St 0.82 0.38 210 <0.0001 EQs NFt 0.08 0.01 207 <0.0001 EXt EXs 0.19 0.02 177 <0.0001 NFs Gt 0.29 0.03 172 <0.0001 EQt NFs 0.11 0.01 133 <0.0001 Ss Gt 0.16 0.03 95 <0.0001 Ss PFt 0.30 0.10 90 <0.0001 St Gs 0.07 0.04 36 <0.0001 PFs Gt 0.14 0.04 34 <0.0001 LFs Gt 0.22 0.04 30 <0.0001 St EQs 0.11 0.07 29 <0.0001 Gt EXs 0.07 0.03 14 0.002 St Qs 0.07 0.05 14 0.0002 Gt Gs 0.10 0.05 9 0.0027 EQt EQs 0.13 0.08 8 0.0042 Table 2. Dependent Adjacency Pairs 3 HMM on Adjacency Pair Sequences The keyboard-to-keyboard tutorial interaction re-sulted in a sequence of utterances that were anno-tated with dialogue acts.  We have hypothesized that a higher-level dialogue structure, namely the tutorial dialogue mode, overlays the observed dia-logue acts.  To build an HMM model of this struc-
50
ture we treat dialogue mode as a hidden variable and train a hidden Markov model to induce the dialogue modes and their associated dialogue act emission probability distributions.    An adjacency pair joining algorithm (Figure 1) was applied to each sequence of dialogue acts.  This algorithm joins pairs of dialogue acts into atomic units according to a priority determined by the strength of the adjacency pair dependency.  Sort adjacency pair list L by descending statistical significance For each adjacency pair (act1, act2) in L         For each dialogue act sequence (a1, a2, ?, an)          in the corpus                 Replace all pairs (ai=act1, ai+1=act2) with a                 new single act (act1act2) Figure 1.  Adjacency Pair Joining Algorithm     Figure 2 illustrates the application of the adja-cency pair joining algorithm on a sequence of dia-logue acts.  Any dialogue acts that were not grouped into adjacency pairs at the completion of the algorithm are treated as atomic units in the HMMianalysis.   Original Dialogue Act Sequence: Qs - St - LFt - St - St - Gs - EQs - LFt - St - St - Qs - St After Adjacency Pair Joining Algorithm: QsSt - LFt - St - StGs - EQsLFt - St - St - QsSt Figure 2.  DA Sequence Before/After Joining     The final set of observed symbols consists of 39 tags: 23 adjacency pairs (Table 2) plus all individ-ual dialogue acts augmented with a tag for the speaker (Table 1).      It was desirable to learn n, the best number of hidden states, during modeling rather than specify-ing this value a priori.  To this end, we trained and ten-fold cross-validated seven models (each featur-ing randomly-initialized parameters) for each number of hidden states n from 2 to 15, inclusive.2  The average log-likelihood was computed across all seven models for each n, and this average log-                                                           2 n=15 was chosen as an initial maximum number of states because it comfortably exceeded our hypothesized range of 3 to 7 (informed by the tutoring literature).  The Akaike Infor-mation Criterion measure steadily worsened above n = 5, con-firming no need to train models with n > 15. 
likelihood ln was used to compute the Akaike In-formation Criterion, a maximum-penalized likeli-hood estimator that penalizes more complex models (Scott, 2002).  The best fit was obtained with n=4 (Figure 3).  The transition probability distribution among hidden states is depicted in Figure 4, with the size of the nodes indicating rela-tive frequency of each hidden state; specifically, State 0 accounts for 63% of the corpus, States 1 and 3 account for approximately 15% each, and State 2 accounts for 7%.  
  Figure 3.  Dialogue Act Emission Probability  Distribution by Dialogue Mode3 4 Discussion and Future Work This exploratory application of hidden Markov models involves training an HMM on a mixed in-put sequence consisting of both individual dialogue acts and adjacency pairs.  The best-fit HMM con-sists of four hidden states whose emission symbol probability distributions lend themselves to inter-pretation as tutorial dialogue modes.  For example, State 0 consists primarily of tutor statements and positive feedback, two of the most common dia-logue  acts  in our corpus.  The transition probabili-

 Figure 4.  Transition Probability Distribution4  ties also reveal that State 0 is highly stable; a self-transition is most likely with probability 0.835.  State 3 is an interactive state featuring student re-flection in the form of questions, statements, and requests for feedback.  The transition probabilities show that nearly 60% of the time the dialogue transitions from State 3 to State 0; this may indi-cate that after establishing what the student does or does not know in State 3, the tutoring switches to a less collaborative ?teaching? mode represented by State 0.        Future evaluation of the HMM presented here will include comparison with other types of graphical models.  Another important step is to correlate the dialogue profile of each tutoring ses-sion, as revealed by the HMM, to learning and af-fective outcomes of the tutoring session.  This type of inquiry can lead directly to design recommenda-tions for tutorial dialogue systems that aim to maximize particular learner outcomes.  In addition, leveraging knowledge of the task state as well as surface-level utterance content below the dialogue act level are promising directions for refining the descriptive and predictive power of these models.
