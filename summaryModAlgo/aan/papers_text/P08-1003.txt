Abstract
A new approach to large-scale information
extraction exploits both Web documents and
query logs to acquire thousands of open-
domain classes of instances, along with rel-
evant sets of open-domain class attributes at
precision levels previously obtained only on
small-scale, manually-assembled classes.
1 Introduction
Current methods for large-scale information ex-
traction take advantage of unstructured text avail-
able from either Web documents (Banko et al,
2007; Snow et al, 2006) or, more recently, logs of
Web search queries (Pas?ca, 2007) to acquire use-
ful knowledge with minimal supervision. Given a
manually-specified target attribute (e.g., birth years
for people) and starting from as few as 10 seed facts
such as (e.g., John Lennon, 1941), as many as a
million facts of the same type can be derived from
unstructured text within Web documents (Pas?ca et
al., 2006). Similarly, given a manually-specified tar-
get class (e.g., Drug) with its instances (e.g., Vi-
codin and Xanax) and starting from as few as 5 seed
attributes (e.g., side effects and maximum dose for
Drug), other relevant attributes can be extracted for
the same class from query logs (Pas?ca, 2007). These
and other previous methods require the manual spec-
ification of the input classes of instances before any
knowledge (e.g., facts or attributes) can be acquired
for those classes.

The extraction method introduced in this paper
mines a collection of Web search queries and a col-
lection of Web documents to acquire open-domain
classes in the form of instance sets (e.g., {whales,
seals, dolphins, sea lions,...}) associated with class
labels (e.g., marine animals), as well as large sets
of open-domain attributes for each class (e.g., circu-
latory system, life cycle, evolution, food chain and
scientific name for the class marine animals). In
this light, the contributions of this paper are four-
fold. First, instead of separately addressing the
tasks of collecting unlabeled sets of instances (Lin,
1998), assigning appropriate class labels to a given
set of instances (Pantel and Ravichandran, 2004),
and identifying relevant attributes for a given set of
classes (Pas?ca, 2007), our integrated method from
Section 2 enables the simultaneous extraction of
class instances, associated labels and attributes. Sec-
ond, by exploiting the contents of query logs during
the extraction of labeled classes of instances from
Web documents, we acquire thousands (4,583, to
be exact) of open-domain classes covering a wide
range of topics and domains. The accuracy reported
in Section 3.2 exceeds 80% for both instance sets
and class labels, although the extraction of classes
requires a remarkably small amount of supervision,
in the form of only a few commonly-used Is-A ex-
traction patterns. Third, we conduct the first study in
extracting attributes for thousands of open-domain,
automatically-acquired classes, at precision levels
over 70% at rank 10, and 67% at rank 20 as de-
scribed in Section 3.3. The amount of supervision is
limited to five seed attributes provided for only one
reference class. In comparison, the largest previous

Figure 1: Overview of weakly-supervised extraction of
class instances, class labels and class attributes from Web
documents and query logs
study in attribute extraction reports results on a set
of 40 manually-assembled classes, and requires five
seed attributes to be provided as input for each class.
Fourth, we introduce the first approach to infor-
mation extraction from a combination of both Web
documents and search query logs, to extract open-
domain knowledge that is expected to be suitable
for later use. In contrast, the textual data sources
used in previous studies in large-scale information
extraction are either Web documents (Mooney and
Bunescu, 2005; Banko et al, 2007) or, recently,
query logs (Pas?ca, 2007), but not both.
2 Extraction from Documents and Queries
2.1 Open-Domain Labeled Classes of Instances
Figure 1 provides an overview of how Web docu-
ments and queries are used together to acquire open-
domain, labeled classes of instances (phase (1) in the
figure); and to acquire attributes that capture quan-
tifiable properties of those classes, by mining query
logs based on the class instances acquired from the
documents, while guiding the extraction based on a
few attributes provided as seed examples (phase (2)).
As described in Figure 2, the algorithm for de-
riving labeled sets of class instances starts with the
acquisition of candidate pairs {ME} of a class la-
bel and an instance, by applying a few extraction
patterns to unstructured text within Web documents
{D}, while guiding the extraction by the contents
of query logs {Q} (Step 1 in Figure 2). This is fol-
Input: set of Is-A extraction patterns {E}
. large repository of search queries {Q}
. large repository of Web docs {D}
. weighting parameters J?[0,1] and K?1..?
Output: set of pairs of a class label and an instance {<C,I>}
Variables: {S} = clusters of distributionally similar phrases
. {V} = vectors of contextual matches of queries in text
. {ME} = set of pairs of a class label and an instance
. {CS} = set of class labels
. {X}, {Y} = sets of queries
Steps:
01. {ME} = Match patterns {E} in docs {D} around {Q}
02. {V} = Match phrases {Q} in docs {D}
03. {S} = Generate clusters of queries based on vectors {V}
04. For each cluster of phrases S in {S}
05. {CS} = ?
06. For each query Q of S
07. Insert labels of Q from {ME} into {CS}
08. For each label CS of {CS}
09. {X} = Find queries of S with the label CS in {ME}
10. {Y} = Find clusters of {S} containing some query
10. with the label CS in {ME}
11. If |{X}| > J?|{S}|
12. If |{Y}| < K
13. For each query X of {X}
14. Insert pair <CS ,X> into output pairs {<C,I>}
15. Return pairs {<C,I>}
Figure 2: Acquisition of labeled sets of class instances
lowed by the generation of unlabeled clusters {S} of
distributionally similar queries, by clustering vectors
of contextual features collected around the occur-
rences of queries {Q} within documents {D} (Steps
2 and 3). Finally, the intermediate data {ME} and
{S} is merged and filtered into smaller, more accu-
rate labeled sets of instances (Steps 4 through 15).
Step 1 in Figure 2 applies lexico-syntactic pat-
terns {E} that aim at extracting Is-A pairs of an in-
stance (e.g., Google) and an associated class label
(e.g., Internet search engines) from text. The two
patterns, which are inspired by (Hearst, 1992) and
have been the de-facto extraction technique in previ-
ous work on extracting conceptual hierarchies from
text (cf. (Ponzetto and Strube, 2007; Snow et al,
2006)), can be summarized as:
?[..] C [such as|including] I [and|,|.]?,
where I is a potential instance (e.g., Venezuelan
equine encephalitis) and C is a potential class label
for the instance (e.g., zoonotic diseases), for exam-
ple in the sentence: ?The expansion of the farms
increased the spread of zoonotic diseases such as
Venezuelan equine encephalitis [..]?.
During matching, all string comparisons are case-
insensitive. In order for a pattern to match a sen-
tence, two conditions must be met. First, the class
20
label C from the sentence must be a non-recursive
noun phrase whose last component is a plural-form
noun (e.g., zoonotic diseases in the above sentence).
Second, the instance I from the sentence must also
occur as a complete query somewhere in the query
logs {Q}, that is, a query containing the instance and
nothing else. This heuristic acknowledges the dif-
ficulty of pinpointing complex entities within doc-
uments (Downey et al, 2007), and embodies the
hypothesis that, if an instance is prominent, Web
search users will eventually ask about it.
In Steps 4 through 14 from Figure 2, each clus-
ter is inspected by scanning all labels attached to
one or more queries from the cluster. For each la-
bel CS , if a) {ME} indicates that a large number
of all queries from the cluster are attached to the la-
bel (as controlled by the parameter J in Step 12);
and b) those queries are a significant portion of all
queries from all clusters attached to the same label
in {ME} (as controlled by the parameter K in Step
13), then the label CS and each query with that la-
bel are stored in the output pairs {<C,I>} (Steps
13 and 14). The parameters J and K can be used
to emphasize precision (higher J and lower K) or
recall (lower J and higher K). The resulting pairs
of an instance and a class label are arranged into
sets of class instances (e.g., {rabies, west nile virus,
leptospirosis,...}), each associated with a class label
(e.g., zoonotic diseases), and returned in Step 15.
2.2 Open-Domain Class Attributes
The labeled classes of instances collected automat-
ically from Web documents are passed as input
to phase (2) from Figure 1, which acquires class
attributes by mining a collection of Web search
queries. The attributes capture properties that are
relevant to the class. The extraction of attributes ex-
ploits the set of class instances rather than the asso-
ciated class label, and consists of four stages:
1) identification of a noisy pool of candidate at-
tributes, as remainders of queries that also contain
one of the class instances. In the case of the class
movies, whose instances include jay and silent bob
strike back and kill bill, the query ?cast jay and
silent bob strike back? produces the candidate at-
tribute cast;
2) construction of internal search-signature vector
representations for each candidate attribute, based
on queries (e.g., ?cast selection for kill bill?) that
contain a candidate attribute (cast) and a class in-
stance (kill bill). These vectors consist of counts
tied to the frequency with which an attribute occurs
with a given ?templatized? query. The latter replaces
specific attributes and instances from the query with
common placeholders, e.g., ?X for Y?;
3) construction of a reference internal search-
signature vector representation for a small set of
seed attributes provided as input. A reference vec-
tor is the normalized sum of the individual vectors
corresponding to the seed attributes;
4) ranking of candidate attributes with respect to
each class (e.g., movies), by computing similarity
scores between their individual vector representa-
tions and the reference vector of the seed attributes.
The result of the four stages is a ranked list of
attributes (e.g., [opening song, cast, characters,...])
for each class (e.g., movies).
In a departure from previous work, the instances
of each input class are automatically generated as
described earlier, rather than manually assembled.
Furthermore, the amount of supervision is limited
to seed attributes being provided for only one of
the classes, whereas (Pas?ca, 2007) requires seed at-
tributes for each class. To this effect, the extrac-
tion includes modifications such that only one ref-
erence vector is constructed internally from the seed
attributes during the third stage, rather one such vec-
tor for each class in (Pas?ca, 2007); and similarity
scores are computed cross-class by comparing vec-
tor representations of individual candidate attributes
against the only reference vector available during the
fourth stage, rather than with respect to the reference
vector of each class in (Pas?ca, 2007).

3.1 Textual Data Sources
The acquisition of open-domain knowledge, in the
form of class instances, labels and attributes, re-
lies on unstructured text available within Web doc-
uments maintained by, and search queries submitted
to, the Google search engine.
The collection of queries is a random sample of
fully-anonymized queries in English submitted by
Web users in 2006. The sample contains approx-
imately 50 million unique queries. Each query is

accompanied by its frequency of occurrence in the
logs. The document collection consists of approx-
imately 100 million Web documents in English, as
available in a Web repository snapshot from 2006.
The textual portion of the documents is cleaned of
HTML, tokenized, split into sentences and part-of-
speech tagged using the TnT tagger (Brants, 2000).
3.2 Evaluation of Labeled Classes of Instances
Extraction Parameters: The set of instances that
can be potentially acquired by the extraction algo-
rithm described in Section 2.1 is heuristically lim-
ited to the top five million queries with the highest
frequency within the input query logs. In the ex-
tracted data, a class label (e.g., search engines) is
associated with one or more instances (e.g., google).
Similarly, an instance (e.g., google) is associated
with one or more class labels (e.g., search engines
and internet search engines). The values chosen
for the weighting parameters J and K from Sec-
tion 2.1 are 0.01 and 30 respectively. After dis-
carding classes with fewer than 25 instances, the ex-
tracted set of classes consists of 4,583 class labels,
each of them associated with 25 to 7,967 instances,
with an average of 189 instances per class.
Accuracy of Class Labels: Built over many years of
manual construction efforts, lexical gold standards
such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) provide wide-
coverage upper ontologies of the English language.
Built-in morphological normalization routines make
it straightforward to verify whether a class label
(e.g., faculty members) exists as a concept in Word-
Net (e.g., faculty member). When an extracted label
(e.g., central nervous system disorders) is not found
in WordNet, it is looked up again after iteratively re-
moving its leading words (e.g., nervous system dis-

whose class labels are found in WordNet only after re-
moval of their leading words (C=Correctness, Y=correct,

orders, system disorders and disorders).
As shown in Table 1, less than half of the 4,583
extracted class labels (e.g., baseball players) are
found in their original forms in WordNet. The ma-
jority of the class labels (2,614 out of 4,583) can be
found in WordNet only after removal of one or more
leading words (e.g., caribbean countries), which
suggests that many of the class labels correspond to
finer-grained, automatically-extracted concepts that
are not available in the manually-built WordNet. To
test whether that is the case, a random sample of
200 class labels, out of the 2,614 labels found to
be potentially-useful specific concepts, are manually
annotated as correct, subjectively correct or incor-
rect, as shown in Table 2. A class label is: correct,
if it captures a relevant concept although it could not
be found in WordNet; subjectively correct, if it is
relevant not in general but only in a particular con-
text, either from a subjective viewpoint (e.g., mod-
ern appliances), or relative to a particular tempo-
ral anchor (e.g., current players), or in connection
to a particular geographical area (e.g., area hospi-
tals); or incorrect, if it does not capture any use-
ful concept (e.g., multiple languages). The manual
analysis of the sample of 200 class labels indicates
that 154 (77%) are relevant concepts and 27 (13.5%)
are subjectively relevant concepts, for a total of 181
(90.5%) relevant concepts, whereas 19 (9.5%) of the
labels are incorrect. It is worth emphasizing the im-
portance of automatically-collected classes judged
as relevant and not present in WordNet: caribbean
countries, computer manufacturers, entertainment
companies, market research firms are arguably very
useful and should probably be considered as part of

Table 3: Comparison between manually-assembled instance sets of gold-standard classes (M ) and instance sets of
automatically-extracted classes (E). Each gold-standard class (M ) was manually mapped into an extracted class (E),
unless no relevant mapping was found. Ratios ( M?EM ) are shown as percentages
any refinements to hand-built hierarchies, including
any future extensions of WordNet.
Accuracy of Class Instances: The computation of
the precision of the extracted instances (e.g., fifth el-
ement and kill bill for the class label movies) relies
on manual inspection of all instances associated to
a sample of the extracted class labels. Rather than
inspecting a random sample of classes, the evalua-
tion validates the results against a reference set of 40
gold-standard classes that were manually assembled
as part of previous work (Pas?ca, 2007). A class from
the gold standard consists of a manually-created
class label (e.g., AircraftModel) associated with a
manually-assembled, and therefore high-precision,
set of representative instances of the class.
To evaluate the precision of the extracted in-
stances, the manual label of each gold-standard class
(e.g., SearchEngine) is mapped into a class label ex-
tracted from text (e.g., search engines). As shown
in the first two columns of Table 3, the mapping into
extracted class labels succeeds for 37 of the 40 gold-
standard classes. 28 of the 37 mappings involve
linking an abstract class label (e.g., SearchEngine)
with the corresponding plural forms among the ex-
tracted class labels (e.g., search engines). The re-
maining 9 mappings link a manual class label with
either an equivalent extracted class label (e.g., Soc-
cerClub with football clubs), or a strongly-related
class label (e.g., NationalPark with parks). No map-
ping is found for 3 out of the 40 classes, namely Air-
craftModel, Hurricane and Skyscraper, which are
therefore removed from consideration.
The sizes of the instance sets available for each
class in the gold standard are compared in the third
through fifth columns of Table 3. In the table, M
stands for manually-assembled instance sets, and E
for automatically-extracted instance sets. For ex-
ample, the gold-standard class SearchEngine con-
tains 25 manually-collected instances, while the
parallel class label search engines contains 133
automatically-extracted instances. The fifth col-
umn shows the percentage of manually-collected in-
stances (M ) that are also extracted automatically
(E). In the case of the class SearchEngine, 16 of the
25 manually-collected instances are among the 133
automatically-extracted instances of the same class,

which corresponds to a relative coverage of 64%
of the manually-collected instance set. Some in-
stances may occur within the manually-collected set
but not the automatically-extracted set (e.g., zoom-
info and brainbost for the class SearchEngine) or,
more frequently, vice-versa (e.g., surfwax, blinkx,
entireweb, web wombat, exalead etc.). Overall,
the relative coverage of automatically-extracted in-
stance sets with respect to manually-collected in-
stance sets is 26.89%, as an average over the 37
gold-standard classes. More significantly, the size
advantage of automatically-extracted instance sets
is not the undesirable result of those sets contain-
ing many spurious instances. Indeed, the manual
inspection of the automatically-extracted instances
sets indicates an average accuracy of 79.3% over the
37 gold-standard classes retained in the experiments.
To summarize, the method proposed in this paper ac-
quires open-domain classes from unstructured text
of arbitrary quality, without a-priori restrictions to
specific domains of interest and with virtually no su-
pervision (except for the ubiquitous Is-A extraction
patterns), at accuracy levels of around 90% for class
labels and 80% for class instances.
3.3 Evaluation of Class Attributes
Extraction Parameters: Given a target class spec-
ified as a set of instances and a set of five seed at-
tributes for a class (e.g., {quality, speed, number of
users, market share, reliability} for SearchEngine),
the method described in Section 2.2 extracts ranked
lists of class attributes from the input query logs.
Internally, the ranking uses Jensen-Shannon (Lee,
1999) to compute similarity scores between internal
representations of seed attributes, on one hand, and
each of the candidate attributes, on the other hand.
Evaluation Procedure: To remove any possible
bias towards higher-ranked attributes during the as-
sessment of class attributes, the ranked lists of at-
tributes to be evaluated are sorted alphabetically into
a merged list. Each attribute of the merged list is

Figure 3: Accuracy of attributes extracted based on man-
ually assembled, gold standard (M ) vs. automatically ex-
tracted (E) instance sets, for a few target classes (left-
most graphs) and as an average over all (37) target classes
(rightmost graphs). Seed attributes are provided as input
for each target class (top graphs), or for only one target
class (bottom graphs)
manually assigned a correctness label within its re-
spective class. An attribute is vital if it must be
present in an ideal list of attributes of the class; okay
if it provides useful but non-essential information;
and wrong if it is incorrect.
To compute the overall precision score over a
ranked list of extracted attributes, the correctness la-
bels are converted to numeric values as shown in Ta-
ble 4. Precision at some rank N in the list is thus
measured as the sum of the assigned values of the
first N candidate attributes, divided by N .
Accuracy of Class Attributes: Figure 3 plots pre-
cision values for ranks 1 through 50 of the lists of
attributes extracted through several runs over the 37
gold-standard classes described in the previous sec-
tion. The runs correspond to different amounts of
supervision, specified through a particular choice in
the number of seed attributes, and in the source of
instances passed as input to the system:
? number of input seed attributes: seed attributes
are provided either for each of the 37 classes, for a
total of 5?37=185 attributes (the graphs at the top of
Figure 3); or only for one class (namely, Country),

? source of input instance sets: the instance sets
for each class are either manually collected (M from
Table 3), or automatically extracted (E from Ta-
ble 3). The choices correspond to the two curves
plotted in each graph in Figure 3.
The graphs in Figure 3 show the precision over
individual target classes (leftmost graphs), and as an
average over all 37 classes (rightmost graphs). As
expected, the precision of the extracted attributes as
an average over all classes is best when the input in-
stance sets are hand-picked (M ), as opposed to au-
tomatically extracted (E). However, the loss of pre-
cision from M to E is small at all measured ranks.
Table 5 offers an alternative view on the quality
of the attributes extracted for a random sample of
25 classes out of the larger set of 4,583 classes ac-
quired from text. The 25 classes are passed as in-
put for attribute extraction without modifications. In
particular, the instance sets are not manually post-
filtered or otherwise changed in any way. To keep
the time required to judge the correctness of all ex-
tracted attributes within reasonable limits, the eval-
uation considers only the top 20 (rather than 50) at-
tributes extracted per class. As shown in Table 5, the
method proposed in this paper acquires attributes for
automatically-extracted, open-domain classes, with-
out a-priori restrictions to specific domains of inter-
est and relying on only five seed attributes specified
for only one class, at accuracy levels reaching 70%
at rank 10, and 67% at rank 20.

4.1 Acquisition of Classes of Instances
Although some researchers focus on re-organizing
or extending classes of instances already available
explicitly within manually-built resources such as
Wikipedia (Ponzetto and Strube, 2007) or Word-
Net (Snow et al, 2006) or both (Suchanek et al,
2007), a large body of previous work focuses on
compiling sets of instances, not necessarily labeled,
from unstructured text. The extraction proceeds
either iteratively by starting from a few seed ex-
traction rules (Collins and Singer, 1999), or by
mining named entities from comparable news arti-
cles (Shinyama and Sekine, 2004) or from multilin-
gual corpora (Klementiev and Roth, 2006).
A bootstrapping method (Riloff and Jones, 1999)
cautiously grows very small seed sets of five in-
stances of the same class, to fewer than 300 items
after 50 consecutive iterations, with a final preci-
sion varying between 46% and 76% depending on
the type of semantic lexicon. Experimental results
from (Feldman and Rosenfeld, 2006) indicate that
named entity recognizers can boost the performance
of weakly supervised extraction of class instances,
but only for a few coarse-grained types such as Per-
son and only if they are simpler to recognize in
text (Feldman and Rosenfeld, 2006).

In (Cafarella et al, 2005), handcrafted extraction
patterns are applied to a collection of 60 million Web
documents to extract instances of the classes Com-
pany and Country. Based on the manual evaluation
of samples of extracted instances, an estimated num-
ber of 1,116 instances of Company are extracted at
a precision score of 90%. In comparison, the ap-
proach of this paper pursues a more aggressive goal,
by extracting a larger and more diverse number of
labeled classes, whose instances are often more dif-
ficult to extract than country names and most com-
pany names, at precision scores of almost 80%.
The task of extracting relevant labels to describe
sets of documents, rather than sets of instances, is
explored in (Treeratpituk and Callan, 2006). Given
pre-existing sets of instances, (Pantel and Ravichan-
dran, 2004) investigates the task of acquiring appro-
priate class labels to the sets from unstructured text.
Various class labels are assigned to a total of 1,432
sets of instances. The accuracy of the class labels
is computed over a sample of instances, by manu-
ally assessing the correctness of the top five labels
returned by the system for each instance. The result-
ing mean reciprocal rank of 77% gives partial credit
to labels of an evaluated instance, even if only the
fourth or fifth assigned labels are correct. Our eval-
uation of the accuracy of class labels is stricter, as it
considers only one class label of a given instance at a
time, rather than a pool of the best candidate labels.
As a pre-requisite to extracting relations among
pairs of classes, the method described in (Davidov et
al., 2007) extracts class instances from unstructured
Web documents, by submitting pairs of instances as
queries and analyzing the contents of the top 1,000
documents returned by a Web search engine. For
each target class, a small set of instances must be
provided manually as seeds. As such, the method
can be applied to the task of extracting a large set of
open-domain classes only after manually enumerat-
ing through the entire set of target classes, and pro-
viding seed instances for each. Furthermore, no at-
tempt is made to extract relevant class labels for the
sets of instances. Comparatively, the open-domain
classes extracted in our paper have an explicit la-
bel in addition to the sets of instances, and do not
require identifying the range of the target classes
in advance, or providing any seed instances as in-
put. The evaluation methodology is also quite dif-
ferent, as the instance sets acquired based on the in-
put seed instances in (Davidov et al, 2007) are only
evaluated for three hand-picked classes, with preci-
sion scores of 90% for names of countries, 87% for
fish species and 68% for instances of constellations.
Our evaluation of the accuracy of class instances is
again stricter, since the evaluation sample is larger,
and includes more varied classes, whose instances
are sometimes more difficult to identify in text.
4.2 Acquisition of Class Attributes
Previous work on the automatic acquisition of at-
tributes for open-domain classes from text is less
general than the extraction method and experiments
presented in our paper. Indeed, previous evalua-
tions were restricted to small sets of classes (forty
classes in (Pas?ca, 2007)), whereas our evaluations
also consider a random, more diverse sample of
open-domain classes. More importantly, by drop-
ping the requirement of manually providing a small
set of seed attributes for each target class, and rely-
ing on only a few seed attributes specified for one
reference class, we harvest class attributes without
the need of first determining what the classes should
be, what instances they should contain, and from
which resources the instances should be collected.
5 Conclusion
In a departure from previous approaches to large-
scale information extraction from unstructured text
on the Web, this paper introduces a weakly-
supervised extraction framework for mining useful
knowledge from a combination of both documents
and search query logs. In evaluations over labeled
classes of instances extracted without a-priori re-
strictions to specific domains of interest and with
very little supervision, the accuracy exceeds 90%
for class labels, approaches 80% for class instances,
and exceeds 70% (at rank 10) and 67% (at rank 20)
for class attributes. Current work aims at expanding
the number of instances within each class while re-
taining similar precision levels; extracting attributes
with more consistent precision scores across classes
from different domains; and introducing confidence
scores in attribute extraction, allowing for the detec-
tion of classes for which it is unlikely to extract large
numbers of useful attributes from text.
