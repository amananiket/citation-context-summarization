Abstract
This paper presents a partial matching strat-
egy for phrase-based statistical machine trans-
lation (PBSMT). Source phrases which do not
appear in the training corpus can be trans-
lated by word substitution according to par-
tially matched phrases. The advantage of this
method is that it can alleviate the data sparse-
ness problem if the amount of bilingual corpus
is limited. We incorporate our approach into
the state-of-the-art PBSMT system Moses and
achieve statistically significant improvements
on both small and large corpora.
1 Introduction
Currently, most of the phrase-based statistical ma-
chine translation (PBSMT) models (Marcu and
Wong, 2002; Koehn et al, 2003) adopt full matching
strategy for phrase translation, which means that a
phrase pair (f? , e?) can be used for translating a source
phrase f? , only if f? = f? . Due to lack of generaliza-
tion ability, the full matching strategy has some lim-
itations. On one hand, the data sparseness problem
is serious, especially when the amount of the bilin-
gual data is limited. On the other hand, for a certain
source text, the phrase table is redundant since most
of the bilingual phrases cannot be fully matched.
In this paper, we address the problem of trans-
lation of unseen phrases, the source phrases that
are not observed in the training corpus. The
alignment template model (Och and Ney, 2004)
enhanced phrasal generalizations by using words
classes rather than the words themselves. But the
phrases are overly generalized. The hierarchical
phrase-based model (Chiang, 2005) used hierar-
chical phrase pairs to strengthen the generalization
ability of phrases and allow long distance reorder-
ings. However, the huge grammar table greatly in-
creases computational complexity. Callison-Burch
et al (2006) used paraphrases of the trainig corpus
for translating unseen phrases. But they only found
and used the semantically similar phrases. Another
method is to use multi-parallel corpora (Cohn and
Lapata, 2007; Utiyama and Isahara, 2007) to im-
prove phrase coverage and translation quality.
This paper presents a partial matching strategy for
translating unseen phrases. When encountering un-
seen phrases in a source sentence, we search par-
tially matched phrase pairs from the phrase table.
Then we keep the translations of the matched part
and translate the unmatched part by word substitu-
tion. The advantage of our approach is that we alle-
viate the data sparseness problem without increasing
the amount of bilingual corpus. Moreover, the par-
tially matched phrases are not necessarily synony-
mous. We incorporate the partial matching method
into the state-of-the-art PBSMT system, Moses. Ex-
periments show that, our approach achieves statis-
tically significant improvements not only on small
corpus, but also on large corpus.
2 Partial Matching for PBSMT
2.1 Partial Matching
We use matching similarity to measure how well the
source phrases match each other. Given two source
phrases f?J1 and f? ?
J
1 , the matching similarity is com-
puted as:

the same POS sequence and word alignment.
SIM(f?J1 , f? ?
J
1 ) =
?J
j=1 ?(fj , f ?j)
J (1)
where,
?(f, f ?) =
{
1 if f = f ?
0 otherwise (2)
Therefore, partial matching takes full matching
(SIM(f? , f?) = 1.0) as a special case. Note that in
order to improve search efficiency, we only consider
the partially matched phrases with the same length.
In our experiments, we use a matching threshold
? to tune the precision of partial matching. Low
threshold indicates high coverage of unseen phrases,
but will suffer from much noise. In order to alleviate
this problem, we search partially matched phrases
under the constraint that they must have the same
parts-of-speech (POS) sequence. See Figure 1 for
illustration. Although the matching similarity of the
two phrases is only 0.2, as they have the same POS
sequence, the word alignments are the same. There-
fore, the lower source phrase can be translated ac-
cording to the upper phrase pair with correct word
reordering. Furthermore, this constraint can sharply
decrease the computational complexity since there
is no need to search the whole phrase table.
2.2 Translating Unseen Phrases
We translate an unseen phrase fJ1 according to the
partially matched phrase pair (f ?J1 , e?I1, a?) as follows:
1. Compare each word between fJ1 and f ?J1 to get
the position set of the different words: P =
{j|fj 6= f ?j , j = 1, 2, . . . , J};
2. Remove f ?j from f ?J1 and e?aj from e?I1, where
j ? P ;
3. Find the translation e for fj(j ? P ) from the
phrase table and put it into the position aj in
e?I1 according to the word alignment a?.

Figure 2 shows an example. In fact, we create a
translation template dynamically in step 2:
?u X1 -? X2, arrived in X2 X1? (3)
Here, on the source side, each of the non-terminal
X corresponds to a single source word. In addition,
the removed sub-phrase pairs should be consistent
with the word alignment matrix.
Following conventional PBSMT models, we use
4 features to measure phrase translation quality: the
translation weights p(f? |e?) and p(e?|f?), the lexical
weights pw(f? |e?) and pw(e?|f?). The new constructed
phrase pairs keep the translation weights of their
?parent? phrase pair. The lexical weights are com-
puted by word substitution. Suppose S{(f ?, e?)} is
the pair set in (f? ?,e??,a?) which replaced by S{(f, e)}
to create the new phrase pair (f? ,e?,a?), the lexical
weight is computed as:
pw(f? |e?, a?)
=
pw(f? ?|e??, a?) ?
?
(f,e)?S{(f,e)} pw(f |e)?
(f ?,e?)?S{(f ?,e?)} pw(f ?|e?)
(4)
Therefore, the newly constructed phrase pairs can be
used for decoding as they have already existed in the
phrase table.
2.3 Incorporating Partial Matching into the
PBSMT Model
In this paper, we incorporate the partial matching
strategy into the state-of-the-art PBSMT system,
Moses1. Given a source sentence, Moses firstly
uses the full matching strategy to search all possi-
ble translation options from the phrase table, and
then uses a beam-search algorithm for decoding.

162
Therefore, we do incorporation by performing par-
tial matching for phrase translation before decod-
ing. The advantage is that the main search algorithm
need not be changed.
For a source phrase f? , we search partially
matched phrase pair (f? ?, e??, a?) from the phrase table.
If SIM(f? , f? ?)=1.0, which means f? is observed in
the training corpus, thus e?? can be directly stored as a
translation option. However, if ? ? SIM(f? , f? ?) <
1.0, we construct translations for f? according to Sec-
tion 2.2. Then the newly constructed translations are
stored as translation options.
Moses uses translation weights and lexical
weights to measure the quality of a phrase transla-
tion pair. For partial matching, besides these fea-
tures, we add matching similarity SIM(f? , f? ?) as a
new feature. For a source phrase, we select top N
translations for decoding. In Moses, N is set by the
pruning parameter ttable-limit.
3 Experiments
We carry out experiments on Chinese-to-English
translation on two tasks: Small-scale task, the train-
ing corpus consists of 30k sentence pairs (840K +
950K words); Large-scale task, the training cor-
pus consists of 2.54M sentence pairs (68M + 74M
words). The 2002 NIST MT evaluation test data is
used as the development set and the 2005 NIST MT
test data is the test set. The baseline system we used
for comparison is the state-of-the-art PBSMT sys-
tem, Moses.
We use the ICTCLAS toolkit2 to perform Chinese
word segmentation and POS tagging. The training
script of Moses is used to train the bilingual corpus.
We set the maximum length of the source phrase
to 7, and record word alignment information in the
phrase table. For the language model, we use the
SRI Language Modeling Toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) to
train a 4-gram model on the Xinhua portion of the
Gigaword corpus.
To run the decoder, we set ttable-limit=20,
distortion-limit=6, stack=100. The translation qual-
ity is evaluated by BLEU-4 (case-sensitive). We per-
form minimum-error-rate training (Och, 2003) to
tune the feature weights of the translation model to
maximize the BLEU score on development set.

Table 1: Effect of matching threshold on BLEU score.
3.1 Small-scale Task
Table 1 shows the effect of matching threshold on
translation quality. The baseline uses full matching
(?=1.0) for phrase translation and achieves a BLEU
score of 24.44. With the decrease of the matching
threshold, the BLEU scores increase. when ?=0.3,
the system obtains the highest BLEU score of 25.31,
which achieves an absolute improvement of 0.87
over the baseline. However, if the threshold con-
tinue decreasing, the BLEU score decreases. The
reason is that low threshold increases noise for par-
tial matching.
The effect of matching threshold on the coverage
of n-gram phrases is shown in Figure 3. When us-
ing full matching (?=1.0), long phrases (length?3)
face a serious data sparseness problem. With the de-
crease of the threshold, the coverage increases.

Table 2 shows the phrase number of 1-best out-
put under ?=1.0 and ?=0.3. When ?=1.0, the long
phrases (length?3) only account for 2.9% of the to-
tal phrases. When ?=0.3, the number increases to
10.7%. Moreover, the total phrase of ?=0.3 is less
than that of ?=1.0, since source text is segmented
into more long phrases under partial matching, and
most of the long phrases are translated from partially
matched phrases (the row 0.3? SIM <1.0).
3.2 Large-scale Task
For this task, the BLEU score of the baseline is
30.45. However, for partial matching method with

?=0.53, the BLEU score is 30.96, achieving an ab-
solute improvement of 0.51. Using Zhang?s signif-
icant tester (Zhang et al, 2004), both the improve-
ments on the two tasks are statistically significant at
p < 0.05.
The improvement on large-scale task is less than
that on small-scale task since larger corpus relieves
data sparseness. However, the partial matching ap-
proach can also improve translation quality by using
long phrases. For example, the segmentation and
translation for the Chinese sentence ???L
?????? are as follows:
Full matching:
? | ?L? |? | |?? |?
long term | economic output | , but | the | trend | will
Partial matching:
? | ?L???? |?
but | the long-term trend of economic output | will
Here the source phrase ??L ?  ? ?
?? cannot be fully matched. Thus the decoder
breaks it into 4 short phrases, but performs an in-
correct reordering. Using partial matching, the long
phrase is translated correctly since it can partially

the inevitable trend of economic development?.
3.3 Conclusion
This paper presents a partial matching strategy for
phrase-based statistical machine translation. Phrases
which are not observed in the training corpus can
be translated according to partially matched phrases
by word substitution. Our method can relieve data
sparseness problem without increasing the amount
of the corpus. Experiments show that our approach
achieves statistically significant improvements over
the state-of-the-art PBSMT system Moses.
In future, we will study sophisticated partial
matching methods, since current constraints are ex-
cessively strict. Moreover, we will study the effect

affect word substitution and reordering.
