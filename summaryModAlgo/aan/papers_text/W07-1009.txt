Abstract
Although recent named entity (NE) annotation ef-
forts involve the markup of nested entities, there has
been limited focus on recognising such nested struc-
tures. This paper introduces and compares three
techniques for modelling and recognising nested
entities by means of a conventional sequence tag-
ger. The methods are tested and evaluated on two
biomedical data sets that contain entity nesting. All
methods yield an improvement over the baseline tag-
ger that is only trained on flat annotation.
1 Introduction
Traditionally, named entity recognition (NER) has
focussed on entities which are continuous, non-
nested and non-overlapping. In other words, each
token in the text belongs to at most one entity, and
NEs consist of a continuous sequence of tokens.
However, in some situations, it may make sense to
relax these restrictions, for example by allowing en-
tities to be nested inside other entities, or allowing
discontinuous entities. GENIA (Ohta et al, 2002)
and BioInfer (Pyysalo et al, 2007) are examples of
recently produced NE-annotated biomedical corpora
where entities nest. Corpora in other domains, for
example the ACE1 data, also contain nested entities.
This paper compares techniques for recognising
nested entities in biomedical text. The difficulty of
this task is that the standard method for convert-
ing NER to a sequence tagging problem with BIO-
encoding (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995), where each
1http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/ace/
index.htm
token is assigned a tag to indicate whether it is at the
beginning (B), inside (I), or outside (O) of an en-
tity, is not directly applicable when tokens belong to
more than one entity. Here we explore methods of
reducing the nested NER problem to one or more BIO
problems so that existing NER tools can be used.
This paper is organised as follows. In Section 2,
the problem of nested entities is introduced and mo-
tivated with examples from GENIA and our EPPI
(enriched protein-protein interaction) data. Related
work is reviewed in Section 3. The proposed tech-
niques enabling NER for nested NEs are explained in
Section 4. Section 5 details the experimental setup,
including descriptive statistics of the corpora and
specifics of the classifier. The results of comparing
different tagging methods are analysed in Section 6,
with a discussion and conclusion in Section 7.
2 Nested Entities
The majority of previous work on NER is conducted
using data sets annotated either with continuous,
non-nested and non-overlapping NEs or an annota-
tion scheme reduced to a flat annotation of a similar
kind in order to simplify the recognition task. How-
ever, annotated corpora often contain entities that are
nested or discontinuous. For example, the GENIA
corpus contains nested entities such as:
<RNA><DNA>CIITA</DNA>mRNA</RNA>
where the string ?CIITA? denotes a DNA and the en-
tire string ?CIITA mRNA? refers to an RNA. Such
nesting complicates the task of traditional NER sys-
tems, which generally rely on data represented with
the BIO encoding or other flat annotation variations
thereof. The majority of NER studies on corpora

containing nested structures focus on recognising
the outermost (non-embedded) entities (e.g. Kim et
al. 2004) , as they contain the most information,
including that of embedded entities (Zhang et al,
2004). This enables a simplification of the recog-
nition task to a sequential analysis problem.
Our aim is to recognise all levels of NE nesting
occurring in two biomedical corpora: the GENIA
corpus (Version 3.02) and the EPPI corpus (see Sec-
tion 5.1). The latter data set was collected and an-
notated as part of the TXM project. Its annotation
contains 9 different biomedical entities. While the
GENIA corpus contains nested entities up to a level
of four layers of embedding, the nested entities in
the EPPI corpus only have three layers. Table 1 lists
the ten most frequent types of entity nesting occur-
ring in both corpora. In the remainder of the paper,
we differentiate between:
embedded NEs: contained in other NEs
non-embedded NEs: not contained in other NEs
containing NEs: containing other NEs
non-containing NEs: not containing other NEs
The GENIA corpus is made up of a larger per-
centage of both embedded entity (18.61%) and con-
taining entity (16.95%) mentions than the EPPI data
(12.02% and 8.27%, respectively). In both corpora,
nesting can occur in three different ways:
1. Entities containing one or more shorter embed-
ded entities. Such nesting is very frequent in both
data sets. For example, the DNA ?IL-2 promoter? in
the GENIA corpus contains the protein ?IL-2?. In
the EPPI corpus, fusions and complexes often con-
tain nested proteins, e.g. the complex ?CBP/p300?,
where ?CBP? and ?p300? are marked as proteins.
2. Entities with more than one entity type. Al-
though they occur in both data sets, they are very
rare in the GENIA corpus. For example, the string
?p21ras? is annotated both as DNA and protein. In
the EPPI data, proteins can also be annotated as
drug/compound, where it can be clearly established
that the protein is used as a drug to affect the func-
tion of an organism, cell, or biological process.
3. Coordinated entities. Coordinated NEs account
for approximately 2% of all NEs in the GENIA and
EPPI data. In the original corpora they are anno-
tated differently, but for this work they are all con-
verted to a common format.2 The outermost anno-
tation of coordinated structures and any continuous
entity mark-up within them is retained. For exam-
ple, in ?human interleukin-2 and -4? both the con-
tinuous embedded entity ?human interleukin-2? and
the entire string are marked as proteins. The markup
for discontinuous embedded entities, like ?human
interleukin-4? in the previous example, is not re-
tained, as they could be derived in a post-processing
step once nested entities are recognised.
3 Related Work
In previous work addressing nested entities, Shen et
al. (2003), Zhang et al (2004), Zhou et al (2004),
Zhou (2006), and Gu (2006) considered the GENIA

66
corpus, where nested entities are relatively frequent.
All these studies ignore embedded entities occur-
ring in coordinated structures and only retain their
outermost annotation. Shen et al (2003), Zhang et
al. (2004), and Zhou et al (2004) all report on a rule-
based approach to dealing with nested NEs in the
GENIA corpus (Version 3.0) in combination with a
Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that first recognises
innermost NEs. They use four basic hand-crafted
patterns and a combination thereof to generate nest-
ing rules from the training data and thereby derive
NEs containing the innermost NEs. The experimen-
tal setup of these studies differs slightly. While Shen
et al (2003) and Zhang et al (2004) report results
testing on 4% of the abstracts in the GENIA corpus,
Zhou et al (2004) report 10-fold cross-validation
scores. Zhou (2006) applies the same rule-based
method for dealing with nested entities to the out-
put of a mutual information independence model
(MIIM) combined with a support vector machine
(SVM) plus sigmoid. His results are based on 5-fold
cross-validation on the GENIA corpus (Version 3.0).
In each of the studies, the rule-based approach to
nested entities results in an improvement of between
3.0 and 3.5 points in F1 over the baseline model.
However, as explicitly stated by Shen et al (2003)
and Zhang et al (2004), this evaluation is limited to
non-embedded (i.e. top-level and non-nested) enti-
ties. The highest overall F1-score reported for all
entities in the GENIA corpus is 71.2 (Zhou, 2006),
which again only appears to reflect the performance
on non-embedded entities.
Zhang et al (2004) also compare the rule-based
method with HMM-based cascaded recognition that
extends iteratively from the shortest to the longest
entities. Their basic HMM model is combined with
HMM models trained on transformed cascaded an-
notations. During training, embedded entity terms
are replaced by their entity type as a way of unnest-
ing the data. During testing, subsequent iterations
rely on the tagging of the first recognition pass and
are repeated until no more entities are recognised.
However, this method only results in an improve-
ment of 1.2 points in F1 over their basic classifier.
Gu (2006) reports results on recognising nested
entities in the GENIA corpus (Version 3.02) when
training an SVM-light binary classifier to recognise
either proteins or DNA. Training with the outermost
labelling yields better performance on recognising
outermost entities and, conversely, using the inner
labelling results in highest scores for recognising in-
ner entities. The best exact match F1-scores of 73.0
and 47.5 for proteins and DNA, respectively, are ob-
tained when training on data with inner labelling and
evaluating on the inner entities.
McDonald et al (2005) propose structured multil-
abel classification as opposed to sequential labelling
for dealing with nested, discontinuous, and overlap-
ping NEs. This approach uses a novel text segment
representation in preference to the BIO-encoding.
Their corpus contains MEDLINE abstracts on the
inhibition of the enzyme CYP450 (Kulick et al,
2004), specifically those abstracts that contain at
least one overlapping and one discontinuous anno-
tation. While this data does not contain nested NEs,
discontinuous and overlapping NEs make up 6% of
all NEs. The classifier performs competitively with
sequential tagging models on continuous and non-
overlapping entities for NER and noun phrase chunk-
ing. On discontinuous and overlapping NEs in the
biomedical data alone, its best performance is 56.25
F1. As the corpus does not contain nested NEs, it
would be of interest to investigate the algorithm?s
performance on the GENIA corpus.
4 Modelling Techniques
As large amounts of time and effort have been de-
voted to work on non-nested NER using the BIO-
encoding approach, it would be useful if this work
could be easily applied to nested NER. In this paper,
three different ways of addressing nested NER will
be compared: layering, cascading, and joined la-
bel tagging. All techniques aim to reduce the nested
NER problem to one or more BIO problems, so that
existing NER tools can be used. Table 2 shows an ex-
ample representation for each modelling technique
of the following two non-nested and nested entity
annotations found in a GENIA abstract:
<multi cell>mice</multi cell> . . .
<other name><RNA><protein>tumor
necrosis factor-alpha</protein>
(<protein>TNF- alpha</protein>)
messenger RNA</RNA> levels</other name>
In layering, each level of nesting is modelled as a
separate BIO problem. The output of models trained
on individual layers is combined subsequent to tag-
ging by taking the union. Layers can be created

inside-out or outside-in. For inside-out layering, the
first layer is made up of all non-containing entities,
the second layer is composed of all those entities
which only contain one layer of nesting, etc. Con-
versely, outside-in layering means that the first layer
contains all non-embedded entities, the second layer
contains all entities which are only contained within
one outer entity, etc. Both directions of layering can
be modelled using a conventional NE tagger.
Cascading reduces the nested NER task to sev-
eral BIO problems by grouping one or more entity
types and training a separate model for each group.
Again, the output from individual models is com-
bined during tagging. Subsequent models in the cas-
cade may have access to the guesses of previous
ones by means of a GUESS feature. The cascaded
method is unable to recognise entities containing en-
tities of the same type, which may be a drawback for
some data sets. Cascading also raises the issue of
how to group entity types. This is dependent on the
types of entities that nest within a given data set and
would potentially require large amounts of experi-
mentation to determine the best combination. More-
over, training a model for each entity type lengthens
training time considerably, and may degrade perfor-
mance due to the dominance of the O tags for infre-
quent categories. It is possible, however, to create a
cascaded tagger combining one model trained on all
entity types with models trained on entity types that
frequently contain other entities.
Finally, joined label tagging entails creating one
tagging problem for all entities by concatenating the
BIO tags of all levels of nesting. A conventional
named entity recogniser is then trained on the data
containing the joined labels. Once the classifier has
assigned the joined labels during tagging, they are
decoded into their original BIO format for each in-
dividual entity type. Compared to the other tech-
niques, joined label tagging involves a much larger
tag set, which can increase dramatically with the
number of entity types occurring in a data set. This
can result in data sparsity which may have a detri-
mental effect on performance.
5 Experimental Setup
5.1 Corpora
GENIA (V3.02), a large publicly available biomedi-
cal corpus annotated with biomedical NEs, is widely
used in the text mining community (Cohen et al,
2005). This data set consists of 2,000 MEDLINE ab-
stracts in the domain of molecular biology (?0.5m
tokens). The annotations used for the experiments
68
reported here are based on the GENIA ontology,
published in Ohta et al (2002). It contains the fol-
lowing classes: amino acid monomer, atom, body
part, carbohydrate, cell component, cell line, cell
type, DNA, inorganic, lipid, mono-cell, multi-cell,
nucleotide, other name, other artificial source, other
organic compound, peptide, polynucleotide, protein,
RNA, tissue, and virus. In this work, protein, DNA
and RNA sub-types are collapsed to their super-type,
as done in previous studies (e.g. Zhou 2006). To the
best of our knowledge, no inter-annotator agreement
(IAA) figures on the NE-annotation in the GENIA
corpus are reported in the literature.
The EPPI corpus consists of 217 full-text papers
selected from PubMed and PubMedCentral as con-
taining protein-protein interactions (PPIs). The pa-
pers were either retrieved in XML or HTML, depend-
ing on availability, and converted to an internal XML
format. Domain experts annotated all documents
for NEs and PPIs, as well as extra (enriched) in-
formation associated with PPIs and normalisations
of entities to publicly available ontologies. The en-
tity annotations are the focus of the current work.
The types of entities annotated in this data set are:
complex, cell line, drug/compound, experimental
method, fusion, fragment, modification, mutant, and
protein. Out of the 217 papers, 125 were singly
annotated, 65 were doubly annotated, and 27 were
triply annotated. The IAA, measured by taking the
F1 score of one annotator with respect to another
when the same paper is annotated by two different
annotators, ranges from 60.40 for the entity type
mutant to 91.59 for protein, with an overall micro-
averaged F1-score of 84.87. The EPPI corpus (?2m
tokens) is divided into three sections, TRAIN (66%),
DEVTEST (17%), and TEST (17%), with TEST only
to be used for final evaluation, and not to be con-
sulted by the researchers in the development and fea-
ture optimisation phrase. The experiments described
here involve the EPPI TRAIN and DEVTEST sets.
5.2 Pre-processing
All documents are passed through a sequence of pre-
processing steps implemented using the LT-XML2
and LT-TTT2 tools (Grover et al, 2006) with the out-
put of each step encoded in XML mark-up. Tokeni-
sation and sentence splitting is followed by part-of-
speech tagging with the Maximum Entropy Markov
Model (MEMM) tagger developed by Curran and
Clark (2003) (hereafter referred to as C&C ) for
the CoNLL-2003 shared task (Tjong Kim Sang and
De Meulder, 2003), trained on the MedPost data
(Smith et al, 2004). Information on lemmatisa-
tion, as well as abbreviations and their long forms, is
added using the morpha lemmatiser (Minnen et al,
2000) and the ExtractAbbrev script of Schwartz and
Hearst (2003), respectively. A lookup step uses on-
tological information to identify scientific and com-
mon English names of species. Finally, a rule-based
chunker marks up noun and verb groups and their
heads (Grover and Tobin, 2006).
5.3 Named Entity Tagging
The C&C tagger, referred to earlier, forms the basis
of the NER component of the TXM natural language
processing (NLP) pipeline designed to detect entity
relations and normalisations (Grover et al, 2007).
The tagger, in common with many ML approaches
to NER, reduces the entity recognition problem to
a sequence tagging problem by using the BIO en-
coding of entities. As well as performing well on
the CoNLL-2003 task, Maximum Entropy Markov
Models have also been successful on biomedical
NER tasks (Finkel et al, 2005). As the vanilla C&C
tagger (Curran and Clark, 2003) is optimised for
performance on newswire text, various modifica-
tions were applied to improve its performance for
biomedical NER. Table 3 lists the extra features
specifically designed for biomedical text. The C&C
tagger was also extended using several gazetteers,
including a protein, complex, experimental method
and modification gazetteer, targeted at recognising
entities occurring in the EPPI data. Further post-
processing specific to the EPPI data involves correct-
ing boundaries of some hyphenated proteins and fil-
tering out entities ending in punctuation.
All experiments with the C&C tagger involve 5-
fold cross-validation on all 2,000 GENIA abstracts
and the combined EPPI TRAIN and DEVTEST sets.
Cross-validation is carried out at the document level.
For simple tagging, the C&C tagger is trained on
the non-containing entities (innermost) or on the
non-embedded entities (outermost). For inside-out
and outside-in layering, a separate C&C model is
trained for each layer of entities in the data, i.e. four
models for the GENIA data and three models for
the EPPI data. Cascading is performed on individual
entities with different orderings, either ordering en-

tity models according to performance or entity fre-
quency in the training data, ranging from highest to
lowest. Cascading is also carried out on groups of
entities (e.g. one model for all entities, one for a
specific entity type, and combinations). Subsequent
models in the cascade have access to the guesses of
previous ones via a GUESS feature. Finally, joined
label tagging is done by concatenating individual
BIO tags from the innermost to the outermost layer.
As in the GENIA corpus, the most frequently an-
notated entity type in the EPPI data is protein with al-
most 55% of all annotations in the combined TRAIN
and DEVTEST data (see Table 5). Given that the
scores reported in this paper are calculated as F1
micro-averages over all categories, they are strongly
influenced by the classifier?s performance on pro-
teins. However, scoring is not limited to a particular
layer of entities (e.g. only outermost layer), but in-
cludes all levels of nesting. During scoring, a correct
match is achieved when exactly the same sequence
of text (encoded in start/end offsets) is marked with
the same entity type in the gold standard and the sys-
tem output. Precision, recall and F1 are calculated
in standard fashion from the number of true positive,
false positive and false negative NEs recognised.
6 Results
Table 4 lists overall cross-validation F1-scores cal-
culated for all NEs at all levels of nesting when ap-
plying the various modelling techniques. For GE-
NIA, cascading on individual entities when order-
ing entity models by performance yields the high-
est F1-score of 67.88. Using this method yields
an increase of 3.26 F1 over the best simple tag-
ging method, which scores 64.62 F1. Joined label
tagging results in the second best overall F1-score
of 67.82. Both layering (inside-out) and cascading
(combining a model trained on all NEs with 4 mod-
els trained on other name, DNA, protein, or RNA)
also perform competitively, reaching F1-scores of
67.62 and 67.56, respectively. In the experiments
with the EPPI corpus, cascading is also the winner
with an F1-score of 70.50 when combining a model
trained on all NEswith one trained on fusions. This
method only results in a small, yet statistically sig-
nificant (?2, p ? 0.05), increase in F1 of 0.43 over
the best simple tagging algorithm. This could be due
to the smaller number of nested NEs in the EPPI data
and the fact that this data contains many NEs with
more than one category. Layering (inside-out) per-
forms almost as well as cascading (F1=70.44).
The difference in the overall performance be-
tween the GENIA and the EPPI corpus is partially
due to the difference in the number of NEs which
C&C is required to recognise, but also due to the
fact that all features used are optimised for the EPPI
data and simply applied to the GENIA corpus. The
only feature not used for the experiments with the
GENIA corpus is FONT, as this information is not
preserved in the original XML of that corpus.
7 Discussion and Conclusion
According to the results for the modelling tech-
niques, each proposed method outperforms simple
tagging. Cascading yields the best result on the GE-
NIA (F1=67.88) and EPPI data (F1=70.50), see Ta-
ble 5 for individual entity scores. However, it in-
volves extensive amounts of experimentation to de-
termine the best model combination. The best setup
for cascading is clearly data set dependent. With
larger numbers of entity types annotated in a given
corpus, it becomes increasingly impractical to ex-
haustively test all possible orders and combinations.
Moreover, training and tagging times are lengthened
as more models are combined in the cascade.

Despite the large number of tags involved in us-
ing joined label tagging, this method outperforms
simple tagging for both data sets and even results in
the second-best overall F1-score of 67.72 obtained
for the GENIA corpus. The fact that joined label
tagging only requires training and tagging with one
model makes this approach a viable alternative to
cascading which is far more time-consuming to run.
Inside-out layering performs competitively both
for the GENIA corpus (F1=67.62) and the EPPI cor-
pus (F1=70.37), considering how little time is in-
volved in setting up such experiments. As with
joined label tagging, minimal optimisation is re-
quired when using this method. One disadvantage
(as compared to simple, and to some extent joined
label tagging) is that training and tagging times in-
crease with the number of layers that are modelled.
In conclusion, this paper introduced and tested
three different modelling techniques for recognising
nested NEs, namely layering, cascading, and joined
label tagging. As each of them reduces nested NER
to one or more BIO-encoding problems, a conven-
tional sequence tagger can be used. It was shown
that each modelling technique outperfoms the sim-
ple tagging method for both biomedical data sets.
Future work will involve testing the proposed
techniques on other data sets containing entity nest-
ing, including the ACE data. We will also determine
their merit when applying a different learning algo-
rithm. Furthermore, possible solutions for recognis-
ing discontinuous entities will be investigated.
