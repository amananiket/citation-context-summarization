The need to correct garbled strings arises in many areas of natural language processing. If a
dictionary is available that covers all possible input tokens, a natural set of candidates for correcting
an erroneous input P is the set of all words in the dictionary for which the Levenshtein distance to P
does not exceed a given (small) bound k. In this article we describe methods for efficiently selecting
such candidate sets. After introducing as a starting point a basic correction method based on the
concept of a ?universal Levenshtein automaton,? we show how two filtering methods known from
the field of approximate text search can be used to improve the basic procedure in a significant
way. The first method, which uses standard dictionaries plus dictionaries with reversed words,
leads to very short correction times for most classes of input strings. Our evaluation results
demonstrate that correction times for fixed-distance bounds depend on the expected number of
correction candidates, which decreases for longer input words. Similarly the choice of an optimal
filtering method depends on the length of the input words.
1. Introduction
In this article, we face a situation in which we receive some input in the form of strings
that may be garbled. A dictionary that is assumed to contain all possible correct input
strings is at our disposal. The dictionary is used to check whether a given input is
correct. If it is not, we would like to select the most plausible correction candidates
from the dictionary. We are primarily interested in applications in the area of natural
language processing in which the background dictionary is very large and fast selection
of an appropriate set of correction candidates is important. By a ?dictionary,? we
mean any regular (finite or infinite) set of strings. Some possible concrete application
scenarios are the following:
? The dictionary describes the set of words of a highly inflectional or
agglutinating language (e.g., Russian, German, Turkish, Finnish,
Hungarian) or a language with compound nouns (German). The
dictionary is used by an automated or interactive spelling checker.
? The dictionary is multilingual and describes the set of all words of a
family of languages. It is used in a system for postcorrection of results of
OCR in which scanned texts have a multilingual vocabulary.

? The dictionary describes the set of all indexed words and phrases of an
Internet search engine. It is used to determine the plausibility that a new
query is correct and to suggest ?repaired? queries when the answer set
returned is empty.
? The input is a query to some bibliographic search engine. The dictionary
contains titles of articles, books, etc.
The selection of an appropriate set of correction candidates for a garbled input P is
often based on two steps. First, all entries W of the dictionary are selected for which the
distance between P and W does not exceed a given bound k. Popular distance measures
are the Levenshtein distance (Levenshtein 1966; Wagner and Fischer 1974; Owolabi
and McGregor 1988; Weigel, Baumann, and Rohrschneider 1995; Seni, Kripasundar,
and Srihari 1996; Oommen and Loke 1997) or n-gram distances (Angell, Freund, and
Willett 1983; Owolabi and McGregor 1988; Ukkonen 1992; Kim and Shawe-Taylor 1992,
1994) Second, statistical data, such as frequency information, may be used to compute
a ranking of the correction candidates. In this article, we ignore the ranking problem
and concentrate on the first step. For selection of correction candidates we use the
standard Levenshtein distance (Levenshtein 1966). In most of the above-mentioned
applications, the number of correction candidates becomes huge for large values of k.
Hence small bounds are more realistic.
In light of this background, the algorithmic problem discussed in the article can
be described as follows:
Given a pattern P, a dictionary D, and a small bound k, efficiently
compute the set of all entries W in D such that the Levenshtein distance
between P and W does not exceed k.
We describe a basic method and two refinements for solving this problem. The basic
method depends on the new concept of a universal deterministic Levenshtein au-
tomaton of fixed degree k. The automaton of degree k may be used to decide, for
arbitrary words U and V, whether the Levenshtein distance between U and V does
not exceed k. The automaton is ?universal? in the sense that it does not depend on
U and V. The input of the automaton is a sequence of bitvectors computed from U
and V. Though universal Levenshtein automata have not been discussed previously
in the literature, determining Levenshtein neighborhood using universal Levenshtein
automata is closely related to a more complex table-based method described by the
authors Schulz and Mihov (2002). Hence the main advantage of the new notion is its
conceptual simplicity. In order to use the automaton for solving the above problem,
we assume that the dictionary is given as a determininistic finite-state automaton. The
basic method may then be described as a parallel backtracking traversal of the uni-
versal Levenshtein automaton and the dictionary automaton. Backtracking procedures
of this form are well-known and have been used previously: for example, by Oflazer
(1996) and the authors Schulz and Mihov (2002).
For the first refinement of the basic method, a filtering method used in the field
of approximate text search is adapted to the problem of approximate search in a dic-
tionary. In this approach, an additional ?backwards? dictionary D?R (representing the
set of all reverses of the words of a given dictionary D) is used to reduce approximate
search in D with a given bound k ? 1 to related search problems for smaller bounds
k? < k in D and D?R. As for the basic method, universal Levenshtein automata are used
to control the search. Ignoring very short input words and correction bound k = 1,
453
Mihov and Schulz Fast Approximate Search in Large Dictionaries
this approach leads to a drastic increase in speed. Hence the ?backwards dictionary
method? can be considered the central contribution of this article.
The second refinement, which is only interesting for bound k = 1 and short input
words, also uses a filtering method from the field of approximate text search (Muth
and Manber 1996; Mor and Fraenkel 1981). In this approach, ?dictionaries with single
deletions? are used to reduce approximate search in a dictionary D with bound k = 1
to a conventional lookup technique for finite-state transducers. Dictionaries with single
deletions are constructed by deleting the symbol at a fixed position n in all words of
a given dictionary.
For the basic method and the two refinements, detailed evaluation results are given
for three dictionaries that differ in terms of the number and average length of entries:
a dictionary of the Bulgarian language with 965,339 entries (average length 10.23 sym-
bols), a dictionary of German with 3,871,605 entries (dominated by compound nouns,
average length 18.74 symbols), and a dictionary representing a collection of 1,200,073
book titles (average length 47.64 symbols). Tests were restricted to distance bounds
k = 1, 2, 3. For the approach based on backwards dictionaries, the average correction
time for a given input word?including the displaying of all correction suggestions?
is between a few microseconds and a few milliseconds, depending on the dictionary,
the length of the input word, and the bound k. Correction times over one millisecond
occur only in a few cases for bound k = 3 and short input words. For bound k = 1,
which is important for practical applications, average correction times did not exceed
40 microseconds.
As a matter of fact, correction times are a joint result of hardware improvements
and algorithmic solutions. In order to judge the quality of the correction procedure in
absolute terms, we introduce an ?idealized? correction algorithm in which any kind
of blind search and superfluous backtracking is eliminated. Based on an analysis of
this algorithm, we believe that using purely algorithmic improvements, our correction
times can be improved only by a factor of 50?250, depending on the kind of dictionary
used. This factor represents a theoretical limit in the sense that the idealized algorithm
probably cannot be realized in practice.
This article is structured as follows. In Section 2, we collect some formal prelimi-
naries. In Section 3, we briefly summarize some known techniques from approximate
string search in a text. In Section 4, we introduce universal deterministic Levenshtein
automata of degree k and describe how the problem of deciding whether the Lev-
enshtein distance between two strings P and W does not exceed k can be efficiently
solved using this automaton. Since the method is closely related to a table-based
approach introduced by the authors (Schulz and Mihov 2002), most of the formal de-
tails have been omitted. Sections 5, 6, and 7 describe, respectively, the basic method,
the refined approach based on backwards dictionaries, and the approach based on
dictionaries with single deletions. Evaluation results are given for the three dictio-
naries mentioned above. In Section 8 we briefly comment on the difficulties that
we encountered when trying to combine dictionary automata and similarity keys
(Davidson 1962; Angell, Freund, and Willett 1983; Owolabi and McGregor 1988; Sinha
1990; Kukich 1992; Anigbogu and Belaid 1995; Zobel and Dart 1995; de Bertrand de
Beuvron and Trigano 1995). Theoretical bounds for correction times are discussed in
Section 9.
The problem considered in this article is well-studied. Since the number of contri-
butions is enormous, a complete review of related work cannot be given here. Relevant
references with an emphasis on spell-checking and OCR correction are Blair (1960),
Riseman and Ehrich (1971), Ullman (1977), Angell, Freund, and Willett (1983), Srihari,

and Dart (1995), and Dengel et al (1997). Exact or approximate search in a dictionary
is discussed, for example, in Wells et al (1990), Sinha (1990), Bunke (1993), Oflazer
(1996), and Baeza-Yates and Navarro (1998). Some relevant work from approximate
search in texts is described in Section 3.
2. Formal Preliminaries
We assume that the reader is familiar with the basic notions of formal language theory
as described, for example, by Hopcroft and Ullman (1979) or Kozen (1997). As usual,
finite-state automata (FSA) are treated as tuples of the form A = ??, Q, q0, F,??, where
? is the input alphabet, Q is the set of states, q0 ? Q is the initial state, F is the set
of final states, and ? ? Q ? ?? ? Q is the transition relation. Here ? denotes the
empty string and ?? := ??{?}. The generalized transition relation ?? is defined as the
smallest subset of Q ? ?? ? Q with the following closure properties:
? For all q ? Q we have (q, ?, q) ? ??.
? For all q1, q2, q3 ? Q and W1, W2 ? ??, if (q1, W1, q2) ? ?? and
(q2, W2, q3) ? ?, then also (q1, W1W2, q3) ? ??.
We write L(A) for the language accepted by A. We have L(A) = {W ? ?? | ?q ?
F : (q0, W, q) ? ??}. Given A as above, the set of active states for input W ? ?? is
{q ? Q | (q0, W, q) ? ??}.
A finite-state automaton A is deterministic if the transition relation is a function
? : Q ? ? ? Q. Let A = ??, Q, q0, F, ?? be a deterministic FSA, and let ?? : Q ? ?? ? Q
denote the generalized transition function, which is defined in the usual way. For
q ? Q, we write LA(q) := {U ? ?? | ??(q, U) ? F} for the language of all words that
lead from q to a final state.
The length of a word W is denoted by |W|. Regular languages over ? are defined
in the usual way. With L1 ? L2 we denote the concatenation of the languages L1 and
L2. It is well-known that for any regular language L, there exists a deterministic FSA
AL such that L(A) = L and AL is minimal (with respect to number of states) among
all deterministic FSA accepting L. AL is unique up to renaming of states.
A p-subsequential transducer is a tuple T = ??,?, Q, q0, F, ?,?,??, where
? ??, Q, q0, F, ?? is a deterministic finite-state automaton;
? ? is a finite output alphabet;
? ? : Q ? ? ? ?? is a function called the transition output function;
? the final function ? : F ? 2?? assigns to each f ? F a set of strings over
?, where |?(f )| ? p.
The function ? is extended to the domain Q ? ?? by the following definition of ??:
?q ? Q (??(q, ?) = ?)
?q ? Q ?U ? ?? ?a ? ? (??(q, Ua) = ??(q, U)?(??(q, U), a))
The input language of the transducer is L(T) := {U ? ?? | ??(q0, U) ? F}. The
subsequential transducer maps each word from the input language to a set of at most
455
Mihov and Schulz Fast Approximate Search in Large Dictionaries
p output words. The output function OT : L(T) ? 2?
?
of the transducer is defined as
follows:
?U ? L(T) (OT(U) = ??(q0, U) ??(??(q0, U)))
By a dictionary, we mean a regular (finite or infinite) set of strings over a given
alphabet ?. Using the algorithm described by Daciuk et al (2000), the minimal deter-
ministic FSA AD accepting a finite dictionary D can be effectively computed.
By a dictionary with output sets, we mean a regular (finite or infinite) set of
input strings over a given alphabet together with a function that maps each of the
input strings to a finite set of output strings. Given a finite dictionary with output
sets, we can effectively compute, using the algorithm described by Mihov and Maurel
(2001), the minimal subsequential transducer that maps each input string to its set of
output strings.
3. Background
In this section, we describe some established work that is of help in understanding
the remainder of the article from a nontechnical, conceptual point of view. After in-
troducing the Levenshtein distance, we describe methods for computing the distance,
for checking whether the distance between two words exceeds a given bound, and for
approximate search for a pattern in a text. The similarities and differences described
below between approximate search in a text, on the one hand, and approximate search
in a dictionary, on the other hand, should help the reader understand the contents of
the following sections from a broader perspective.
3.1 Computation of Levenshtein Distance
The most prominent metric for comparing strings is the Levenshtein distance, which
is based on the notion of a primitive edit operation. In this article, we consider the
standard Levenshtein distance. Here the primitive operations are the substitution of
one symbol for another symbol, the deletion of a symbol, and the insertion of a
symbol. Obviously, given two words W and V in the alphabet ?, it is always possible
to rewrite W into V using primitive edit operations.
Definition 1
Let P, W be words in the alphabet ?. The (standard) Levenshtein distance between
P and W, denoted dL(P, W), is the minimal number of primitive edit operations (sub-
stitutions, deletions, insertions) that are needed to transform P into W.
The Levenshtein distance between two words P and W can be computed using the
following simple dynamic programming scheme, described, for example, by Wagner
and Fischer (1974):
dL(?, W) = |W|
dL(P, ?) = |P|
dL(Pa, Wb) =
{
dL(P, W) if a = b
1 + min(dL(P, W), dL(Pa, W), dL(P, Wb)) if a = b
for P, W ? ?? and a, b ? ?. Given P = p1 . . . pm and W = w1 . . .wn (m, n ? 0), a standard
way to apply the scheme is as follows: Proceeding top-down and from left to right,
the cells of an (m + 1)? (n + 1) table TL(P, W) are filled, where entry (i, j) of T(P, W)
is dL(p1 . . . pi, w1 . . .wj) (0 ? i ? m, 0 ? j ? n) (Wagner and Fischer 1974). The first two

clauses above are used for initialization and yield, respectively, the first column and
the first row. The third clause is used to compute the remaining entries. The table for
the strings chold and hchold is shown in Figure 1.
3.2 Testing Levenshtein Neighborhood
The algorithm of Wagner and Fischer, which has time complexity O(m ? n), has been
improved and generalized in many aspects. (See, for example, Stephen [1994] for a
survey). We briefly sketch a more efficient variant that can be used for the restricted
problem of deciding whether the Levenshtein distance between two words P and W
exceeds a fixed bound, k. Ukkonen (1985a) shows that in this case only the values of
2k + 1 ?diagonals? of TL(P, W) are essential for a test to make such a determination.
Figure 1 illustrates the situation in which k = 2. Ukkonen obtained an algorithm
with time complexity O(k ? min(m, n)). He used the test for determining whether the
Levenshtein distance between two words exceeds a given bound to derive an algorithm
for computing the edit distance with complexity O(min(m, n) ? dL(P, W)).
3.3 Approximate Search for a Pattern in a Text
A problem closely related to approximate search in a dictionary is approximate search
for a pattern in a text (AST): Given two strings P and T (called, respectively, the pattern
and the text), find all occurrences T? of substrings of T that are within a given distance
of P. Each occurrence T? is called a hit. In the following discussion, we consider the
case in which a fixed bound k for the Levenshtein distance between P and potential
hits is specified.
3.3.1 Adapting the Dynamic Programming Scheme. A simple adaptation of the
Wagner-Fischer algorithm may be used for approximate search for a pattern P =
p1 ? ? ? pm in a text T = t1 ? ? ? tn. As before, we compute an (m+1)?(n+1) table TAST(P, T).
Entry (i, j) of TAST(P, T) has value h if h is the minimal Levenshtein distance between
p1 ? ? ? pi and a substring of T with last symbol (position) tj (j). From the definition, we
see that all cells in line 0 have to be initialized with 0. The remaining computation
proceeds as above. For a given bound k, the output consists of all positions j such that
entry (m, j) does not exceed k. Note that the positions j in the output are the end points
in T of approximate matches of P. Figure 2 illustrates a search employing dynamic
programming.
3.3.2 Automaton Approach. Several more-efficient methods for approximate search
of a pattern P in a text T take as their starting point a simple nondeterministic finite-
state automaton, AAST(P, k), which accepts the language of all words with Levenshtein

distance ? k to some word in ?? ?P (Ukkonen 1985b; Wu and Manber 1992; Baeza-Yates
and Navarro 1999). The automaton for pattern chold and distance bound k = 2 is shown
in Figure 3. States are numbered in the form be. The ?base number? b determines the
position of the state in the pattern. The ?exponent? e indicates the error level, that
is, the number of edit errors that have been observed. Horizontal transitions encode
?normal? transitions in which the text symbol matches the expected next symbol of
the pattern. Vertical transitions represent insertions, nonempty (respectively, empty)
diagonal transitions represent substitutions (respectively, deletions). In the example
shown in Figure 3, final states are 50, 51, and 52. It is obvious that when using a given
text T as input, we reach a final state of AAST(P, 2) exactly at those positions where
a substring T? of T ends such that dL(P, T?) ? 2. For other bounds k, we just have to
vary the number of levels. Note that a string can be accepted in AAST(P, k) at several
final states. In order to determine the optimal distance between P and a substring T?
of T ending at a certain position, it is necessary to determine the final state that can
be reached that has the smallest exponent.
In the remainder of the article, the set of all states with base number i is called
the ith column of AAST(P, k).
Remark 1
There is a direct relationship between the entries in column j of the dynamic program-
ming table TAST(P, T) and the set of active states of AAST(P, k) that are reached with
input t1 ? ? ? tj. Entry (i, j) of TAST(P, T) has the value h ? k iff h is the exponent of the
bottom-most active state in the ith column of AAST(P, k). For example, in Figure 3, the
set of active states of AAST(chold, k) reached after reading the two symbols t and h
is highlighted. The bottom-most elements 00, 11, 21, and 32 correspond to the entries
0, 1, 1, and 2 shaded in the upper part of the third column of Figure 2.

The direct use of the nondeterministic automaton AAST(P, k) for conducting ap-
proximate searches is inefficient. Furthermore, depending on the length m of the pat-
tern and the error bound k, the explicit construction and storage of a deterministic
version of AAST(P, k) might be difficult or impossible. In practice, simulation of deter-
minism via bit-parallel computation of sets of active states gives rise to efficient and
flexible algorithms. See Navarro (2001) and Navarro and Raffinot (2002) for surveys
of algorithms along this line.
4. Testing Levenshtein Neighborhood with Universal Deterministic
Levenshtein Automata
In our approach, approximate search of a pattern P in a dictionary D is traced back
to the problem of deciding whether the Levenshtein distance between P and an entry
W of D exceeds a given bound k. A well-known method for solving this problem is
based on a nondeterministic automaton A(P, k) similar to AAST(P, k). A string W is
accepted by A(P, k) iff dL(P, W) ? k. The automaton A(P, k) does not have the initial ?
loop that is needed in AAST(P, k) to traverse the text. The automaton for pattern chold
and distance bound k = 2 is shown in Figure 4. Columns of A(P, k) with numbers
0, . . . , m = |P| are defined as for AAST(P, k). In A(P, k), we use as final states all states
q from which we can reach one of the states in column m using a (possibly empty)
sequence of -transitions. The reason for this modification?which obviously does not
change the set of accepted words?will become apparent later.
We now show that for fixed small error bounds k, the explicit computation of
A(P, k), in a deterministic or nondeterministic variant, can be completely avoided. In
our approach, pattern P and entry W = w1 ? ? ?wn are compared to produce a sequence
of n bitvectors ?1, . . . , ?n. This sequence is used as input for a fixed automaton A?(k).
The automaton A?(k) is deterministic and ?universal? in the sense that it does not
depend on a given pattern P. For each bound k, there is just one fixed automaton
A?(k), which is precomputed once and used for arbitrary patterns P and words W.
A?(k) accepts input ?1, . . . , ?n iff dL(P, W) ? k. The efficiency of this method relies
on the fact that given A?(k), we need only one operation for each transition of the
recognition phase after the initial computation of the bitvectors ?1, . . . , ?n.
It is worth mentioning that the possibility of using a fixed universal automaton
A?(k) instead of a specific automaton A(P, k) for each pattern P is based on special
features of the automata A(P, k) (cf. Remark 2); a similar technique for AAST(P, k)
459
Mihov and Schulz Fast Approximate Search in Large Dictionaries
appears to be impossible. For defining states, input vectors and transitions of A?(k),
the following two definitions are essential:
Definition 2
The characteristic vector ?(w, V) of a symbol w ? ? in a word V = v1 ? ? ? vn ? ?? is
the bitvector of length n where the ith bit is set to 1 iff w = vi.
Definition 3
Let P denote a pattern of length m. The triangular area of a state p of A(P, k) consists of
all states q of A(P, k) that can be reached from p using a (potentially empty) sequence
of u upward transitions and, in addition, h ? u horizontal or reverse (i.e., leftward)
horizontal transitions. Let 0 ? i ? m. By triangular area i, we mean the triangular area
of state i0. For j = 1, . . . , k, by triangular area m+j, we mean the triangular area of the
state mj.
For example, in Figure 4, triangular areas 0, . . . , 7 of A(chold, 2) are shown.
In Remark 1, we pointed to the relationship between the entries in column i of table
TAST(P, T) and the set of active states of AAST(P, k) that are reached with input w1 ? ? ?wi.
A similar relationship holds between the entries in column i of table TL(P, T) and the
set of active states of the automaton A(P, k) that are reached with input w1 ? ? ?wi.
Triangular area i corresponds to the ith column of the subregion of TL(P, T) given by
the 2k+ 1 diagonals used in Ukkonen?s (1985a) approach. The left-to-right orientation
in A(P, k) corresponds to a top-down orientation in TL(P, T). As an illustration, the
active states of A(chold, 2) after symbols h and c have been consumed are marked in
Figure 4. The exponents 2, 1, 2, and 2 of the bottom-most active states in columns 1,
2, 3, and 4 are found in the shaded region of the third column of Figure 1.
Remark 2
It is simple to see that for any input string W = w1 . . .wn, the set of active states of
A(P, k) reached after reading the ith symbol wi of W is a subset of triangular area i
(0 ? i ? min{n, m + k}). For i > m + k, the set is empty. Furthermore, the set of active
states that is reached after reading symbol wi depends only
1. on the previous set of active states (the set reached after reading
w1 . . .wi?1, a subset of the triangular area i ? 1);
2. on the characteristic vector ?(wi, pl ? ? ? pi ? ? ? pr) where l = max{1, i ? k}
and r = min{m, i + k}.
The following description of A?(k) proceeds in three steps that introduce, in order,
input vectors, states, and the transition function. States and transition function are
described informally.
1. Input vectors. Basically we want to use the vectors ?(wi, pl ? ? ? pi ? ? ? pr), which
are of length ? 2k + 1, as input for A?(k). For technical reasons, we introduce two
modifications. First, in order to standardize the length of the characteristic vectors that
are obtained for the initial symbols w1, w2, . . ., we define p0 = p?1 = . . . = p?k+1 := $.
In other words, we attach to P a new prefix with k symbols $. Here $ is a new symbol
that does not occur in W. Second imagine that we get to triangular area i after reading
the ith letter wi (cf. Remark 2). As long as i ? m ? k ? 1, we know that we cannot
reach a triangular area containing final states after reading wi. In order to encode
460
Computational Linguistics Volume 30, Number 4
this information in the input vectors, we enlarge the relevant subword of P for input
wi and consider one additional position i + k + 1 on the right-hand side (whenever
i + k + 1 ? m). This means that we use the vectors ?i := ?(wi, pi?k ? ? ? pi ? ? ? pr), where
r = min{m, i+k+1}, as input for A?(k), for 1 ? i ? min{n, m+k}. Consequently, for 0 ?
i ? m?k?1, the length of ?i is 2k+2; for i = m?k (respectively, m?k+1, . . . , m, . . . , m+k),
the length of ?i is 2k + 1 (respectively, 2k, . . . , k + 1, . . . , 1).
Example 1
Consider Figure 4 where P is chold and k = 2. Input hchold is translated into the vectors
?1 = ?(h, $$chol) = 000100
?2 = ?(c, $chold) = 010000
?3 = ?(h, chold) = 01000
?4 = ?(o, hold) = 0100
?5 = ?(l, old) = 010
?6 = ?(d, ld) = 01
The computation of the vectors ?i for input W = w1 . . .wn is based on a prelimi-
nary step in which we compute for each ? ? ? the vector ?(?) := ?(?, $ . . . $p1 . . . pm)
(using k copies of $). The latter vectors are initialized in the form ?(w) := 0k+m. We
then compute for i = 1, . . . , n the value ?(wi) := ?(wi) | 0k+i?110m?i. Here the sym-
bol | denotes bitwise OR. Once we have obtained the values ?(wi), which are repre-
sented as arrays, the vectors ?i := ?(wi, pi?k . . . pi . . . pr) can be accessed in constant
time.
2. States. Henceforth, states of automata A(P, k) will be called positions. Recall
that a position is given by a base number and an exponent e, 0 ? e ? k represent-
ing the error count. By a symbolic triangular area, we mean a triangular area in
which ?explicit? base numbers (like 1, 2, . . .) in positions are replaced by ?symbolic?
base numbers of a form described below. Two kinds of symbolic triangular areas
are used. A unique ?I-area? represents all triangular areas of automata A(P, k) that
do not contain final positions. The ?integer variable? I is used to abstract from pos-
sible base numbers i, 0 ? i ? m ? k ? 1. Furthermore, k + 1 ?M-areas? are used
to represent triangular areas of automata A(P, k) that contain final positions. Vari-
able M is meant to abstract from concrete values of m, which differ for distinct P.
Symbolic base numbers are expressions of the form I, I + 1, I ? 1, I + 2, I ? 2 . . . (I-
areas) or M, M ? 1, M ? 2, . . . (M-areas). The elements of the symbolic areas, which
are called symbolic positions, are symbolic base numbers together with exponents
indicating an error count. Details should become clear in Example 2. The use of ex-
pressions such as (I + 2)2 simply enables a convenient labeling of states of A?(k)
(cf. Figure 6). Using this kind of labeling, it is easy to formulate a correspondence be-
tween derivations in automata A(P, k) and in A?(k) (cf. properties C1 and C2 discussed
below).
Example 2
The symbolic triangular areas for bound k = 1 are
(I-area) {I0, (I ? 1)1, I1, (I + 1)1}
(First M-area) {M0, (M ? 1)1, M1}
(Second M-area) {(M ? 1)0, (M ? 2)1, (M ? 1)1, M1}

Symbolic triangular areas and symbolic final positions for bound k = 2 (cf. Example 2).
Symbolic final positions for k = 1 are M1, M0, and (M ? 1)0. The symbolic triangular
areas for k = 2 are indicated in Figure 5, in which the ellipses around symbolic final
positions are rendered in boldface.
States of A?(k) are merely subsets of symbolic triangular areas. Subsets containing
symbolic final positions are final states of A?(k), and {I0} is the start state. A special
technique is used to reduce the number of states. Returning to automata of the form
A(P, k), it is simple to see that triangular areas often contain positions p = ge and
q = hf where p ?subsumes? q in the following sense: If, for some fixed input rest U, it
is possible to reach a final position of A(P, k) starting from q and consuming U, then
we may also reach a final position starting from p using U. A corresponding notion of
subsumption can be defined for symbolic positions. States of A?(k) are then defined
as subsets of symbolic triangular areas that are free of subsumption in the sense that a
symbolic position of a state is never subsumed by another position of the same state.
Example 3
The states of automaton A?(1) are shown in Figure 6. As a result of the above reduction
technique, the only state containing the symbolic position I0 is {I0}, the start state. Each
of the symbolic positions (I ? 1)1, I1, (I + 1)1 is subsumed by I0.
3. Transition function. It remains to define the transition function ?? of A?(k). We
describe only the basic idea. Imagine an automaton A(P, k), where the pattern P has
length m. Let W = w1 . . .wn denote an input word. Let SPi denote the set of active
positions of A(P, k) that are reached after reading the ith symbol wi (1 ? i ? n). For
simplicity, we assume that in each set, all subsumed positions are erased. In A?(k) we
have a parallel acceptance procedure in which we reach, say, state S?i after reading
?i := ?(wi, pi?k ? ? ? pi ? ? ? pr), where r = min{m, i + k + 1}, as above, for 1 ? i ? n.
Transitions are defined in such a way that C1 and C2 hold:
C1. For all parallel sets SPi and S

S?i uses variable I and instantiating M by m in the other cases.
C2. Whenever SPi contains a final position, then S

i is final.
Given properties C1 and C2, it follows immediately that A(P, k) accepts w1 . . .wn iff
A?(k) accepts ?1, . . . , ?n.

Figure 6
The universal deterministic Levenshtein automaton A?(1). See Example 4 for notation.
Example 4
The universal deterministic automaton A?(1) is shown in Figure 6. (Some redundant
transitions departing from nonfinal states S = {I0} and using vectors of length ? 3
have been omitted.) The symbol stands for either 1 or 0. Moreover, ?( ) is shorthand
for ? or ?. In order to illustrate the use of A?(1), consider the pattern P of the form
chold. Input child is translated into the sequence
?1 = ?(c, $cho) = 0100
?2 = ?(h, chol) = 0100
?3 = ?(i, hold) = 0000
?4 = ?(l, old) = 010
?5 = ?(d, ld) = 01
Starting from state {I0}, we successively reach {I0}, {I0}, {(I?1)1, I1}, {I1}, {M1}. Hence
child is accepted. In a similar way the input word cold is translated into the sequence
0100?0010?0010?001. Starting from {I0}, we successively reach {I0}, {(I?1)1, I1, (I+1)1},
{(I + 1)1}, {M1}. Hence cold is also accepted. Third, input hchold is translated into
the sequence 0010?1000?1000?100?10?1. We reach successively {(I ? 1)1, I1, (I + 1)1},
{(I ? 1)1}, {(I ? 1)1}, {(I ? 1)1}, {(I ? 1)1}, {M1}. Hence hchold is accepted as well.
For larger values of k, the number of states of A?(k) grows rapidly. A?(2) has 50
nonfinal states and 40 final states. The automaton A?(3) has 563 states. When we tried
463
Mihov and Schulz Fast Approximate Search in Large Dictionaries
to minimize the automata A?(1), A?(2), and A?(3), we found that these three automata
are already minimal. However, we do not have a general proof that our construction
always leads to minimal automata.
5. Approximate Search in Dictionaries Using Universal Levenshtein Automata
We now describe how to use the universal deterministic Levenshtein automaton A?(k)
for approximate search for a pattern in a dictionary.
5.1 Basic Correction Algorithm
Let D denote the background dictionary, and let P = p1 . . . pm denote a given pattern.
Recall that we want to compute for some fixed bound k the set of all entries W ? D
such that dL(P, W) ? k. We assume that D is implemented in the form of a determin-
istic finite-state automaton AD = ??, QD, qD0 , FD, ?D?, the dictionary automaton. Hence
L(AD) represents the set of all correct words.
Let A?(k) = ??, Q?, q?0 , F?, ??? denote the universal deterministic Levenshtein au-
tomaton for bound k. We assume that we can access, for each symbol ? ? ? and
each index 1 ? i ? m + k, the characteristic vector ?(?, pi?k ? ? ? pi ? ? ? pr), where r =
min{m, i+ k+ 1}, in constant time (cf. Section 4). We traverse the two automata A?(k)
and AD in parallel, using a standard backtracking procedure. At each step, a symbol
? read in AD representing the ith symbol of the current dictionary path is translated
into the bitvector ?(?, pi?k ? ? ? pi ? ? ? pr), r = min{m, i+ k+1}, which is used as input for
A?(k).
push (<0,?, qD0 , q
?
0>);
while not empty(stack) do begin
pop (<i, W, qD, q?>);
for ? in ? do begin
? := ?(?, pi?k ? ? ? pi ? ? ? pr);
qD1 := ?
D(qD,?);
q?1 := ??(q
?, ?);
if (qD1 <> NIL) and (q
?
1 <> NIL) then begin
W1 := concat(W,?);
push(<i + 1, W1, qD1 , q
?
1>);
if (qD1 ? FD) and (q?1 ? F?) then output(W1);
end;
end;
end;
Starting with the pair of initial states ?qD0 , q?0 ?, position i = 0, and the empty word
?, each step of the traversal adds a new symbol ? ? ? to the actual word W and
leads from a pair of states ?qD, q?? ? QD ? Q? to ??D(qD,?), ??(q?, ?)?. We proceed as
long as both components are distinct from the empty failure state,1 NIL. Whenever
a final state is reached in both automata, the actual word W is added to the output.
It is trivial to show that the list of all output words represents exactly the set of all
dictionary entries W such that dL(W, P) ? k.
The computational cost of the above algorithm is bounded by the size of the
dictionary automaton AD and depends on the bound k used. If k reaches the length of
1 A failure state is a state q whose language LA(q) is empty.
464
Computational Linguistics Volume 30, Number 4
the longest word in the dictionary, then in general (e.g., for the empty input word), the
algorithm will result in a complete traversal of AD. In practice, small bounds are used,
and only a small portion of AD will be visited. For bound 0, the algorithm validates
in time O(|P|) if the input pattern P is in the dictionary.
5.2 Evaluation Results for Basic Correction Algorithm
Experimental results were obtained using a Bulgarian lexicon (BL) with 965, 339 word
entries (average length 10.23 symbols), a German dictionary (GL) with 3, 871, 605
entries (dominated by compound nouns, average length 18.74 symbols), and a ?lex-
icon? (TL) containing 1, 200, 073 bibliographic titles from the Bavarian National
Library (average length 47.64 symbols). The German dictionary and the title
dictionary are nonpublic. They were provided to us by Franz Guenthner and
the Bavarian National Library, respectively, for the tests we conducted. The
following table summarizes the dictionary automaton statistics for the three
dictionaries:
BL GL TL
Number of words 956,339 3,871,605 1,200,073
Automaton states 39,339 4,068,189 29,103,779
Automaton transitions 102,585 6,954,377 30,252,173
Size (bytes) 1,191,548 90,206,665 475,615,320
The basic correction algorithm was implemented in C and tested on a 1.6 GHz
Pentium IV machine under Linux.
5.2.1 A Baseline. Before we present our evaluation results, we give a simplified base-
line. Let a garbled word W be given. In order to find all words from the dictionary
within Levenshtein distance k, we can use two simple methods:
1. For each dictionary word V, check whether dL(V, W) ? k.
2. For each string V such that dL(V, W) ? k, check whether V is in the
dictionary.
We consider input words W of length 10. Visiting a state in an automaton takes
about 0.1 ?s. Using Method 1, the time needed to check whether dL(V, W) ? k for a
dictionary word V using the universal Levenshtein automaton can be estimated as 1
?s (a crude approximation). When using Method 2, we need about 1 ?s for the dic-
tionary lookup of a word with 10 symbols. Assume that the alphabet has 30 symbols.
Given the input W, we have 639 strings within Levenshtein distance 1, about 400,000
strings within distance 2, and about 260,000,000 strings within distance 3. Assum-
ing that the dictionary has 1,000,000 words, we get the following table of correction
times:
Distance 1 Distance 2 Distance 3
Method 1 1,000 ms 1,000 ms 1,000 ms
Method 2 0.639 ms 400 ms 260,000 ms
5.2.2 Correction with BL. To test the basic correction algorithm with the Bulgarian
lexicon, we used a Bulgarian word list containing randomly introduced errors. In each
word, we introduced between zero and four randomly selected symbol substitutions,
465
Mihov and Schulz Fast Approximate Search in Large Dictionaries
insertions, or deletions. The number of test words created for each length is shown in
the following table:
Length 3 4 5 6 7 8
 words 3,563 11,066 27,196 53,763 90,202 128,620
Length 9 10 11 12 13 14
 words 155,888 163,318 148,879 117,783 81,481 50,291
Length 15 16 17 18 19 20
 words 28,481 15,079 8,048 4,350 2,526 1,422
Table 1 lists the results of the basic correction algorithm using BL and standard
Levenshtein distance with bounds k = 1, 2, 3. Column 1 shows the length of the input
words. Column 2 (CT1) describes the average time needed for the parallel traversal of
the dictionary automaton and the universal Levenshtein automaton using Levenshtein
distance 1. The time needed to output the correction candidates is always included;
hence the column represents the total correction time. Column 3 (NC1) shows the
average number of correction candidates (dictionary words within the given distance
bound) per input word. (For k = 1, there are cases in which this number is below 1.
This shows that for some of the test words, no candidates were returned: These words
were too seriously corrupted for correction suggestions to be found within the given
distance bound.) Similarly Columns 4 (CT2) and 6 (CT3) yield, respectively, the total
correction times per word (averages) for distance bounds 2 and 3, and Columns 5
(NC2) and 7 (NC3) yield, respectively, the average number of correction candidates
per word for distance bounds 2 and 3. Again, the time needed to output all corrections
is included.
5.2.3 Correction with GL. To test the correction times when using the German lexicon,
we again created a word list with randomly introduced errors. The number of test
words of each particular length is shown in the following table:
Length 1?14 15?24 25?34 35?44 45?54 55?64
 words 100,000 100,000 100,000 9,776 995 514
The average correction times and number of correction candidates for GL are sum-
marized in Table 2, which has the same arrangement of columns (with corresponding
interpretations) as Table 1.
5.2.4 Correction with TL. To test the correction times when using the title ?lexicon,?
we again created a word list with randomly introduced errors. The number of test
words of each length is presented in the following table:
Length 1?14 15?24 25?34 35?44 45?54 55?64
 words 91,767 244,449 215,094 163,425 121,665 80,765
Table 3 lists the results for correction with TL and standard Levenshtein distance
with bounds k = 1, 2, 3. The arrangement of columns is the same as for Table 1, with
corresponding interpretations.
5.2.5 Summary. For each of the three dictionaries, evaluation times strongly depend on
the tolerated number of edit operations. When fixing a distance bound, the length of
the input word does not have a significant influence. In many cases, correction works
faster for long input words, because the number of correction candidates decreases.
The large number of entries in GL leads to increased correction times.

6. Using Backwards Dictionaries for Filtering
In the related area of pattern matching in strings, various filtering methods have been
introduced that help to find portions of a given text in which an approximate match of
a given pattern P is not possible. (See Navarro [2001] and Navarro and Raffinot [2002]
for surveys). In this section, we show how one general method of this form (Wu
and Manber 1992; Myers 1994; Baeza-Yates and Navarro 1999; Navarro and Baeza-
Yates 1999) can be adapted to approximate search in a dictionary, improving the basic
correction algorithm.
For approximate text search, the crucial observation is the following: If the Leven-
shtein distance between a pattern P and a portion of text T? does not exceed a given
bound k, and if we cut P into k + 1 disjoint pieces P1, . . . , Pk+1, then T? must contain
at least one piece. Hence the search in text T can be started with an exact multipat-
tern search for {P1, . . . , Pk+1}, which is much faster than approximate search for P.
When finding one of the pieces Pi in the text, the full pattern P is searched for (return-
ing now to approximate search) within a small neighborhood around the occurrence.
Generalizations of this idea rely on the following lemma (Myers 1994; Baeza-Yates and
Navarro 1999; Navarro and Raffinot 2002):
Lemma 1
Let T? match P with ? k errors. Let P be represented as the concatenation of j words
P1, . . . , Pj. Let a1, . . . , aj denote arbitrary integers, and define A =
?j
i=1 ai. Then, for
some i ? {1, . . . , j}, Pi matches a substring of T? with ? aik/A errors.2
In our experiments, which were limited to distance bounds k = 1, 2, 3, we used the
following three instances of the general idea. Let P denote an input pattern, and let W
denote an entry of the dictionary D. Assume we cut P into two pieces, representing it
in the form P = P1P2:
1. If dL(P, W) ? 3, then W can be represented in the form W = W1W2,
where we have the following mutually exclusive cases:
(a) dL(P1, W1) = 0 and dL(P2, W2) ? 3

In order to make use of these observations, we compute, given dictionary D, the back-
wards dictionary D?R := {W?R | W ? D}.3 Dictionary D and backwards dictionary
D?R are compiled into deterministic finite-state automata AD and AD?R , respectively. If
the dictionary is infinite and directly given as a finite-state automaton AD, the automa-
ton AD?R may be computed using standard techniques from formal language theory.
Further steps depend on the bound k. We will describe only approximate search with
bound k = 3; the methods for bounds k = 1, 2 are similar.
Let P denote the given pattern. P is cut into two pieces P1, P2 of approximately the
same length. We compute P?R2 and P
?R
1 . We then start four subsearches, corresponding
to Cases (1a)?(1d) specified above.
For subsearch (1a), we first traverse AD using input P1. Let q denote the state that is
reached. Starting from q and the initial state {I0} of A?(3), we continue with a parallel
traversal of AD and A?(3). Transition symbols in AD are translated into input bitvectors
for A?(3) by matching them against appropriate subwords of $$$P2, as described in
Section 5. The sequence of all transition labels of the actual paths in AD is stored as
usual. Whenever we reach a pair of final states, the current sequence?which includes
the prefix P1?is passed to the output. Clearly, each output sequence has the form
P1P?2, where dL(P2, P
?
2) ? 3. Conversely, any dictionary word of this form is found
using subsearch (1a).
For subsearch (1b), we first traverse AD?R using P
?R
2 . Let q denote the state that
is reached. Starting from q and the initial state {I0} of A?(3), we continue with a
parallel traversal of AD?R and A?(3). Transition symbols in AD?R are translated into
input bitvectors for A?(3) by matching them against appropriate subwords of $$$P?R1 .
Whenever we reach a pair of final states, the inversed sequence is passed to the output.
Clearly, each output sequence has the form P?1P2, where dL(P1, P
?
1) ? 3. Conversely, any
dictionary word of this form is found using a search of this form. For a given output,
a closer look at the final state S that is reached in A?(3) may be used to exclude cases
in which P1 = P?1. (Simple details are omitted).
For subsearch (1c), we start with a parallel traversal of AD and A?(1). Transition
symbols in AD are translated into input bitvectors for A?(1) by matching them against
appropriate subwords of $P1. For each pair of states (q, S) that are reached, where S
represents a final state of A?(1), we start a parallel traversal of AD and A?(2), departing
from q and the initial state {I0} of A?(2). Transition symbols in AD are translated
into input bitvectors for A?(2) by matching them against appropriate subwords of
$$P2. Whenever we reach a pair of final states, the current sequence is passed to the
output. Clearly, each output sequence has the form P?1P
?
2, where dL(P1, P
?
1) ? 1 and
dL(P2, P?2) ? 2. Conversely, any dictionary word of this form is found using a search
of this form. A closer look at the final states that are respectively reached in A?(1)
and A?(2) may be used to exclude cases in which P1 = P?1 or P2 = P
?
2. (Again, simple
details are omitted).
For subsearch (1d), we start with a parallel traversal of AD?R and A?(1). Tran-
sition symbols in AD?R are translated into input bitvectors for A?(1) by matching
them against appropriate subwords of $P?R2 . For each pair of states (q, S) that are
reached, where S represents a final state of A?(1), we start a parallel traversal of AD?R
and A?(2), departing from q and the initial state {I0} of A?(2). Transition symbols
in AD?R are translated into input bitvectors for A?(2) by matching them against ap-
propriate subwords of $$P?R1 . Whenever we reach a pair of final states, the inversed
sequence is passed to the output. Clearly, each output sequence has the form P?1P
?

3 W?R denotes the reverse of W.

where dL(P1, P?1) ? 2 and dL(P2, P?2) ? 1. Conversely, any word in the dictionary of
this form is found using a search of this form. A closer look at the final states that
are reached in A?(1) and A?(2) may be used to exclude cases where P2 = P?2 or
dL(P1, P?1) ? 1, respectively. (Again, simple details are omitted).
It should be noted that the output sets obtained from the four subsearches (1a)?
(1d) are not necessarily disjoint, because a dictionary entry W may have more than
one partition W = W1W2 of the form described in cases (1a)?(1d).
6.1 Evaluation Results
The following table summarizes the statistics of the automata for the three backwards
dictionaries:
BL GL TL
Number of words 956,339 3,871,605 1,200,073
Automaton states 54,125 4,006,357 29,121,084
Automaton transitions 183,956 7,351,973 30,287,053
Size (bytes) 2,073,739 92,922,493 475,831,001
Note that the size of the backwards-dictionary automata is approximately the same
as the size of the dictionary automata.
Tables 4, 5, and 6 present the evaluation results for the backwards dictionary
filtering method using dictionaries BL, GL, and TL, respectively. We have constructed
additional automata for the backwards dictionaries.
For the tests, we used the same lists of input words as in Section 5.2 in order
to allow a direct comparison to the basic correction method. Dashes indicate that the
correction times were too small to be measured with sufficient confidence in their level
of precision. In columns 3, 5, and 7, we quantify the speedup factor, that is, the ratio
of the time taken by the basic algorithm to that taken by the backwards-dictionary
filtering method.
6.2 Backwards-Dictionary Method for Levenshtein Distance with Transpositions
Universal Levenshtein automata can also be constructed for the modified Levenshtein
distance, in which character transpositions count as a primitive edit operation, along
with insertions, deletions, and substitutions. This kind of distance is preferable when
correcting typing errors. A generalization of the techniques presented by the authors
(Schulz and Mihov 2002) for modified Levenshtein distances?using either transpo-
sitions or merges and splits as additional edit operations?has been described in
Schulz and Mihov (2001). It is assumed that all edit operations are applied in par-
allel, which implies, for example, that insertions between transposed letters are not
possible.
If we want to apply the filtering method using backwards dictionaries for the
modified Levenshtein distance d?L(P, W) with transpositions, we are faced with the
following problem: Assume that the pattern P = a1a2 . . . amam+1 . . . an is split into P1 =
a1a2 . . . am and P2 = am+1am+2 . . . an. When we apply the above procedure, the case in
which am and am+1 are transposed is not covered. In order to overcome this problem,
we can draw on the following observation:
If d?L(P, W) ? 3, then W can be represented in the form W = W1W2, where there
are seven alternatives, inlcuding the following four:
1. d?L(P1, W1) = 0 and d
?
L(P2, W2) ? 3
2. 1 ? d?L(P1, W1) ? 3 and d?L(P2, W2) = 0

The cases for distance bounds k = 1, 2 are solved using similar extensions of the
original subcase analysis. In each case, it is straightforward to realize a search proce-
dure with subsearches corresponding to the new subcase analysis, using an ordinary
dictionary and a backwards dictionary, generalizing the above ideas.

6.2.1 Summary. The filtering method using backwards dictionaries drastically im-
proves correction times. The increase in speed depends both on the length of the
input word and on the error bound. The method works particularly well for long
input words. For GL, a drastic improvement can be observed for all subclasses. In
contrast, for very short words of BL, only a modest improvement is obtained. When
using BL and the modified Levenshtein distance d?L with transpositions, the backwards-
dictionary method improved the basic search method only for words of length ? 9.
For short words, a large number of repetitions of the same correction candidates was
observed. The analysis of this problem is a point of future work.
Variants of the backwards-dictionary method also can be used for the Levenshtein
distance d??L , in which insertions, deletions, substitutions, merges, and splits are treated
as primitive edit operations. Here, the idea is to split the pattern at two neighboring
positions, which doubles the number of subsearches. We did not evaluate this variant.
7. Using Dictionaries with Single Deletions for Filtering
The final technique that we describe here is again an adaptation of a filtering method
from pattern matching in strings (Muth and Manber 1996; Navarro and Raffinot 2002).
When restricted to the error bound k = 1, this method is very efficient. It can be used
only for finite dictionaries. Assume that the pattern P = p1 . . . pm matches a portion of
text, T?, with one error. Then m ? 1 letters of P are found in T? in the correct order.
472
Computational Linguistics Volume 30, Number 4
This fact can be used to compute m+1 derivatives of P that are compared with similar
derivatives of a window T? of length m that is slid over the text. A derivative of a word
V can be V or a word that is obtained by deleting exactly one letter of V. Coincidence
between derivatives of P and T? can be used to detect approximate matches of P of
the above form. For details we refer to Navarro and Raffinot (2002). In what follows
we describe an adaptation of the method to approximate search of a pattern P in a
dictionary D.
Let i be an integer. With V[i] we denote the word that is obtained from a word
V by deleting the ith symbol of V. For |V| < i, we define V[i] = V. By a dictionary
with output sets, we mean a list of strings W, each of which is associated with a set
of output strings O(W). Each string W is called a key. Starting from the conventional
dictionary D, we compute the following dictionaries with output sets Dall, D1, D2, . . .,
Dn0 , where n0 is the maximal length of an entry in D:
? The set of keys of Dall is D ? {V | ?i ? 1, W ? D such that V = W[i]}. The
output set for key V is
Oall(V) := {W ? D | W = V ? V = W[i] for some i ? 1}.
? The set of keys for Di is D ? {V | ?W ? D such that V = W[i]}. The
output set for a key V is Oi(V) := {W ? D | W = V ? V = W[i]}.
Lemma 2
Let P denote a pattern, and let W ? D. Then dL(P, W) ? 1 iff either W ? Oall(P) or
there exists i, 1 ? i ? |P|, such that W ? Oi(P[i]).
The proof of the lemma is simple and has therefore been omitted.
In our approach, the dictionaries with output sets Dall, D1, D2, . . ., Dn0 are com-
piled, respectively, into minimal subsequential transducers Aall, A1, A2, . . . , An0 . Given a
pattern P, we compute the union of the output sets Oall(P),O1(P[1]),. . .,O|P|(P[|P|]) us-
ing these transducers. It follows from Lemma 2 that we obtain as result the set of all
entries W of D such that dL(P, W) ? 1. It should be noted that the output sets are not
necessarily disjoint. For example, if P itself is a dictionary entry, then P ? Oi(P[i]) for
all 1 ? i ? |P|.
After we implemented the above procedure for approximate search, we found that
a similar approach based on hashing had been described as early as 1981 in a technical
report by Mor and Fraenkel (1981).
7.1 Evaluation Results
Table 8 presents the evaluation results for edit distance 1 using dictionaries with single
deletions obtained from BL. The total size of the constructed single-deletion dictionary
automata is 34.691 megabytes. The word lists used for tests are those described in
Section 5.2. GL and TL are not considered here, since the complete system of subdic-
tionaries needed turned out to be too large. For a small range of input words of length
3?6, filtering using dictionaries with single deletions behaves better than filtering using
the backwards-dictionary method.
8. Similarity Keys
A well-known technique for improving lexical search not mentioned so far is the use
of similarity keys. A similarity key is a mapping ? that assigns to each word W a sim-
plified representation ?(W). Similarity keys are used to group dictionaries into classes
473
Mihov and Schulz Fast Approximate Search in Large Dictionaries
of ?similar? entries. Many concrete notions of ?similarity? have been considered, de-
pending on the application domain. Examples are phonetic similarity (e.g., SOUNDEX
system; cf. Odell and Russell [1918, 1922] and Davidson [1962]), similarity in terms of
word shape and geometric form (e.g., ?envelope representation? [Sinha 1990; Anig-
bogu and Belaid 1995] ) or similarity under n-gram analysis (Angell, Freund, and
Willett 1983; Owolabi and McGregor 1988). In order to search for a pattern P in the
dictionary, the ?code? ?(P) is computed. The dictionary is organized in such a way
that we may efficiently retrieve all regions containing entries with code (similar to)
?(P). As a result, only small parts of the dictionary must be visited, which speeds up
search. Many variants of this basic idea have been discussed in the literature (Kukich
1992; Zobel and Dart 1995; de Bertrand de Beuvron and Trigano 1995).
In our own experiments we first considered the following simple idea. Given a
similarity key ?, each entry W of dictionary D is equipped with an additional pre-
fix of the form ?(W)&. Here & is a special symbol that marks the border between
codes and original words. The enhanced dictionary D? with all entries of the form
?(W)&W is compiled into a deterministic finite-state automaton AD?. Approximate
search for pattern P in D is then reorganized in the following way. The enhanced
pattern ?(P)&P is used for search in AD?. We distinguish two phases in the backtrack-
ing process. In Phase 1, which ends when the special symbol & is read, we compute
an initial path of AD? in which the corresponding sequence of transition labels rep-
resents a code ? such that dL(?(P),?) ? k. All paths of this form are visited. Each
label sequence ?& of the above form defines a unique state q of the automaton AD?
such that LAD?(q) = {W ? D | ?(W) = ?}. In Phase 2, starting from q, we compute all
entries W with code ?(W) = ? such that dL(W, P) ? k. In both phases the automa-
ton A?(k) is used to control the search, and transition labels of AD? are translated into
characteristic vectors. In order to guarantee completeness of the method, the distance
between codes of a pair of words should not exceed the distance between the words
themselves.
It is simple to see that in this method, the backtracking search is automatically
restricted to the subset of all dictionary entries V such that dL(?(V),?(P)) ? k. Unfor-
tunately, despite this, the approach does not lead to reduced search times. A closer
look at the structure of (conventional) dictionary automata AD for large dictionaries D
shows that there exists an enormous number of distinct initial paths of AD of length
3?5. During the controlled traversal of AD, most of the search time is spent visiting
paths of this initial ?wall.? Clearly, most of these paths do not lead to any correction
candidate. Unfortunately, however, these ?blind? paths are recognized too late. Using
the basic method described in Section 5, we have to overcome one single wall in AD for
the whole dictionary. In contrast, when integrating similarity keys in the above form,
we have to traverse a similar wall for the subdictionary D?(W) := {V ? D | ?(V) =
?(W)} for each code ?(W) found in Phase 1. Even if the sets D?(W) are usually much
smaller than D, the larger number of walls that are visited leads to increased traversal
times.
As an alternative, we tested a method in which we attached to each entry W of D all
prefixes of the form ?&, where ? represents a possible code such that dL(?(W),?) ? k.
Using a procedure similar to the one described above, we have to traverse only one
wall in Phase 2. With this method, we obtained a reduction in search time. However,
with this approach, enhanced dictionaries D? are typically much larger than original
dictionaries D. Hence the method can be used only if both dictionary D and bound
k are not too large and if the key is not too fine. Since the method is not more effi-
cient than filtering using backwards dictionaries, evaluation results are not presented
here.

9. Concluding Remarks
In this article, we have shown how filtering methods can be used to improve finite-
state techniques for approximate search in large dictionaries. As a central contribution
we introduced a new correction method, filtering based on backwards dictionaries
and partitioned input patterns. Though this method generally leads to very short
correction times, we believe that correction times could possibly be improved further
using refinements and variants of the method or introducing other filtering methods.
There are, however, reasons to assume that we are not too far from a situation in
which further algorithmic improvements become impossible for fundamental reasons.
The following considerations show how an ?optimal? correction time can be estimated
that cannot be improved upon without altering the hardware or using faster access
methods for automata.
We used a simple backtracking procedure to realize a complete traversal of the
dictionary automaton AD. During a first traversal, we counted the total number of
visits to any state. Since AD is not a tree, states may be passed through several times
during the complete traversal. Each such event counts as one visit to a state. The ratio
of the number of visits to the total number of symbols in the list of words D gives the
average number of visits per symbol, denoted v0. In practice, the value of v0 depends
on the compression rate that is achieved when compiling D into the automaton AD. It is
smaller than 1 because of numerous prefixes of dictionary words that are shared in AD.
We then used a second traversal of AD?not counting visits to states?to compute the
total traversal time. The ratio of the total traversal time to the number of visits yields
the time t0 that is needed for a single visit. For the three dictionaries, the following
values were obtained:
BL GL TL
Average number v0 of visits per symbol 0.1433 0.3618 0.7335
Average time t0 for one visit (in ?s) 0.0918 0.1078 0.0865
Given an input V, we may consider the total number nV of symbols in the list of
correction candidates. Then nV ?v0?t0 can be used to estimate the optimal correction time
for V. In fact, in order to achieve this correction time, we need an oracle that knows
how to avoid any kind of useless backtracking. Each situation in which we proceeded
on a dictionary path that does not lead to a correction candidate for V would require
some extra time that is not included in the above calculation. From another point of
view, the above idealized algorithm essentially just copies the correction candidates
into a resulting destination. The time that is consumed is proportional to the sum of
the length of the correction candidates.

Mihov and Schulz Fast Approximate Search in Large Dictionaries
For each of the three dictionaries, we estimated the optimal correction time for
one class of input words. For BL we looked at input words of length 10. The average
number of correction candidates for Levenshtein distance 3 is 121.73 (cf. Table 1).
Assuming that the average length of correction candidates is 10, we obtain a total of
1, 217.3 symbols in the complete set of all correction candidates. Hence the optimal
correction time is approximately
1217.3 ? 0.0000918 ms ? 0.1433 = 0.016 ms
The actual correction time using filtering with the backwards-dictionary method is
0.827 ms, which is 52 times slower.
For GL, we considered input words of length 15?24 and distance bound 3. We have
on average 3.824 correction candidates of length 20, that is, 76.48 symbols. Hence the
optimal correction time is approximately
76.48 ? 0.0001078 ms ? 0.3618 = 0.003 ms
The actual correction time using filtering with the backwards-dictionary method is
0.601 ms, which is 200 times slower.
For TL, we used input sequences of length 45?54 and again distance bound 3. We
have on average 0.857 correction candidates of length 50, that is, 42.85 symbols. Hence
the optimal correction time is approximately
42.85 ? 0.0000865 ms ? 0.7335 = 0.003 ms
The actual correction time using filtering with the backwards-dictionary method is
0.759 ms, which is 253 times slower.
These numbers coincide with our basic intuition that further algorithmic improve-
ments are simpler for dictionaries with long entries. For example, variants of the
backwards-dictionary method could be considered in which a finer subcase analysis
is used to improve filtering.
