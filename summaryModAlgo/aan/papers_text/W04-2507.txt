Abstract 
In this paper we describe some preliminary 
results of qualitative evaluation of the answer-
ing system HITIQA (High-Quality Interactive 
Question Answering) which has been devel-
oped over the last 2 years as an advanced re-
search tool for information analysts. HITIQA 
is an interactive open-domain question an-
swering technology designed to allow analysts 
to pose complex exploratory questions in natu-
ral language and obtain relevant information 
units to prepare their briefing reports in order 
to satisfy a given scenario. The system uses 
novel data-driven semantics to conduct a clari-
fication dialogue with the user that explores 
the scope and the context of the desired answer 
space. The system has undergone extensive 
hands-on evaluations by a group of intelli-
gence analysts representing various foreign in-
telligence services. This evaluation validated 
the overall approach in HITIQA but also ex-
posed limitations of the current prototype.  
1   Introduction 
Our objective in HITIQA is to allow the user to 
submit exploratory, analytical questions, such as ?What 
has been Russia?s reaction to U.S. bombing of Kos-
ovo?? The distinguishing property of such questions is 
that one cannot generally anticipate what might consti-
tute the answer. While certain types of things may be 
expected (e.g., diplomatic statements), the answer is 
heavily conditioned by what information is in fact avail-
able on the topic, background knowledge of the user, 
context in the scenario, intended audience, etc. From a 
practical viewpoint, analytical questions are often un-
derspecified, thus casting a broad net on a space of pos-
sible answers. Therefore, clarification dialogue is often 
needed to negotiate with the user the exact scope and 
intent of the question, and clarify whether similar topics 
found might also be of interest to the user in order to 
complete their scenario report. This paper will present 
results from a series of evaluations conducted in a series 
of workshops with the intended end users of HITIQA 
(professional intelligence analysts) using the system to 
solve realistic analytic problems. 
HITIQA project is part of the ARDA AQUAINT 
program that aims to make significant advances in the 
state of the art of automated question answering.  In this 
paper we focus on our approach to analytical question 
answering in order to produce a report in response to a 
given scenario.  We also report on the user evaluations 
we conducted and their results with respect to our 
unique approach. 
2   Analytical QA Scenarios 
Analytical scenarios are information task directives 
assigned to analysts to support a larger foreign policy 
process. Scenarios thus contain the information need 
specifications at various levels of detail,  the type, for-
mat and timing of the response required (an intelligence 
report) as well as the primary recipient of the report 
(e.g., the Secretary of State). A hypothetical, but realis-
tic scenario is shown in Figure 1 below. This scenario, 
along with several others like it, was used in evaluating 
 HITIQA performance and fitness for supporting the 
analytical process.  
As can be readily assessed from the directives in 
Figure 1, scenarios are not merely tough questions; they 
are far too complex to be considered as a single question 
at all. It is equally clear that no simple answer can be 
expected and that preparing a report would mean find-
ing answers to a series of interlocking questions or vari-
ous granularities.  
 
Scenario: The al-Qaida Terrorist Group 
 
As an employee of the Central Intelligence Agency, your pro-
fession entails knowledge of the al-Qaida terrorist group.  
Your division chief has ordered a detailed report on the al-
Qaida Terrorist Group due in three weeks. Provide as much 
information as possible on this militant organization. Eventu-
ally, this report should present information regarding the most 
essential concerns, including who are the key figures involved 
with al-Qaida along with other organizations, countries, and 
members that are affiliated, any trades that al-Qaida has made 
with organizations or countries, what facilities they possess, 
where they receive their financial support, what capabilities 
they have (CBW program, other weapons, etc.) and how have 
they acquired them, what is their possible future activity, how 
their training program operates, who their new members are. 
Also, include any other relevant information to your report as 
you see fit.  
 FIGURE 1: Scenario used during user evaluations 
  
We have organized a series of usability evaluations 
with active duty intelligence analysts to find out how 
they approach the problem of solving a scenario. The 
prerequisites for this were are follows: 
1. A robust, broadly functional analytical QA sys-
tem capable of sustaining realistic analytic 
tasks. 
2. A realistic corpus of ?raw intelligence? in form 
of varying quality and verity new-like reports. 
3. A set of realistic, average complexity analytic 
tasks or scenarios to be used. 
HITIQA has been developed over the past two years as 
an open-ended highly flexible interactive QA system to 
allow just this type of evaluation. The system supports a 
variety of information gathering functions without 
straight jacketing the user into any particular mode or 
interaction style. The system does not produce cut and 
dry ?answers?; instead it allows the analysts to build the 
answers the way they want them. While this open-
endedness may seem like unfinished business, we be-
lieve that further development must take into account 
the needs of analysts if they were ever to adopt this 
technology in their work. 
Our main hypothesis is that analysts employ a range 
of strategies to find the required information and that 
these strategies depend significantly upon the nature of 
the task and the progress the analyst is making on the 
task, in addition to individual differences between ana-
lysts. Our experience with interactive systems also indi-
cated that real users are unlikely to follow any single 
information exploration strategy, but instead would use 
multiple, parallel, even overlapping approaches in order 
to maximize the returns and their confidence in the re-
sults. As a corollary we may expect that the scenario 
tasks are unlikely to be systematically decomposed into 
a series of smaller tasks ahead of actual search. In other 
words, the analytical process is a dialogue, not a se-
quence of commands. Moreover, questions actually 
submitted to the system during the analytical process 
seldom seek just the exact answer, instead they are often 
considered as ?light beams? through the data: focusing 
on the answer but also illuminating adjacent, related 
information which may prove just as valuable.  
AFRL, NIST, CNS and ARDA collaborated in the 
development of scenarios used in our evaluation ses-
sions.  
3   Data Driven Semantics of Questions 
When the user poses a question to a system having 
access to a huge database of unstructured data (text 
files), we need to first reduce the big pile to perhaps a 
handful of documents where the answer is likely to be 
found. The easiest way to do it is to convert the question 
into a search query (by removing stopwords and stem-
ming and tokenizing other words) and submitting this 
query to a fast but non-exact document retrieval system, 
e.g.,   Smart (Buckley, 1985) or InQuery (Callan et al, 
1992), or if you are on the web, Google, etc.   
In the current prototype of HITIQA, we use a com-
bination of Google and InQuery to retrieve the top 50 to 
200 documents from a large document database, con-
sisting of several smaller collections such as newspaper 
stories, documents from the Center of Nonproliferation 
Studies, as well as web mined files.  The retrieved 
documents are then broken down into passages, mostly 
exploiting the naturally occurring paragraph structure of 
the original sources. 
The set of text passages returned from the initial 
search is the first (very crude) approximation of the An-
swer Space for the user?s first question. In order to de-
termine what this answer space consists of we perform 
automatic analysis (a combination of hierarchical clus-
tering and classification) to uncover if what we got is a 
fairly homogenous collection (i.e., all texts have very 
similar content), or whether there are a number of di-
verse topics or aspects represented in there, somehow 
tied together by a common thread. In the former case, 
we may be reasonably confident that we have the an-
swer, modulo the retrievable information. In the latter 
case, we know that the question is more complex than 
the user may have intended, and a negotiation process is 
needed to clarify topics of interest for the scenario re-
port. 
 The next step is to measure how well each of the as-
pects within the answer space is ?matching up? against 
the original question. This is accomplished through the 
framing process described later in this paper. The out-
come of the framing process is twofold: first, the alter-
native interpretations of the question are ranked within 3 
broad categories: on-target, near-misses and outliers. 
Second, salient concepts and attributes for each topi-
cal/aspectual group are extracted into topic frames. This 
enables the system to conduct a meaningful dialogue 
with the user, a dialogue which is wholly content ori-
ented, and entirely data driven.  
4   Partial structuring of text data 
In HITIQA we use a text framing technique to de-
lineate the gap between the meaning of the user?s ques-
tion and the system ?understanding? of this question. 
The framing is an attempt to impose a partial structure 
on the text that would allow the system to systemati-
cally compare different text pieces against each other 
and against the question, and also to communicate with 
the user about this. In particular, the framing process 
may uncover topics or aspects within the answer space 
which the user has not explicitly asked for, and thus 
may be unaware of their existence.  This approach is 
particularly beneficial to the needs of the scenario prob-
lem, where these similar aspects frequently are needed 
in completely ?answering? the scenario, with the sce-
nario report.   
In the current version of HITIQA, frames are pre-
defined structures representing various event types. We 
started with the General frame, which can represent any 
event or relation involving any number of entities such 
as people, locations, organizations, time, and so forth.  
In a specialized domain, or if the user interests are 
known to be limited to a particular set of topics, we de-
fine domain-specific frames. Current HITIQA prototype 
has three broad domain-specific frames, related to the 
Weapon of Mass Destruction proliferation domain 
(which was one of the domains of interest to our users). 
These frames are: WMDTransfer, WMDDevelop, 
WMDTreaty, and of course we keep the General frame.  
Obviously, these three frames do not cover the domain 
represented by our data set; they merely capture the 
most commonly occurring types of events. All frames 
contain a small number of core attributes, such as LO-
CATION, PERSON, COUNTRY, ORGANIZATION, ETC., which 
are extracted using BBN?s Identifinder software, which 
extracts 24 types of entities.  Domain-specific frames 
add event specific attributes, which may require extract-
ing additional items from text, or assigning roles to ex-
isting attributes, or both.  For example, WMDTransfer?s 
attributes TRANSFER_TO and TRANSFER_FROM define 
roles of some COUNTRY or ORGANIZATION, while the 
TRANSFER_TYPE attribute scans the text for keywords 
that may indicate the type of transfer, e.g., export, sale, 
etc.  
HITIQA creates a Goal frame for the user?s ques-
tion, which can be subsequently compared to the data 
frames obtained from retrieved data. A Goal frame can 
be a General frame or any of the domain specific frames 
available in HITIQA.  For example, the Goal frame 
generated from the question, ?Where does al-Qaida 
have training facilities?? is a General frame as shown in 
Figure 2.  This was the first question generated by one 
of our analysts during the first evaluation while working 
on the al-Qaida scenario shown in Figure 1.

RELEVANCE:  Conflict: [Topic] 
FIGURE 3: A HITIQA generated data frame and the un-
derlying text passage. Words in bold were used to fill the 
Frame.   
 
HTIQA automatically judges a particular data frame 
as relevant, and subsequently the corresponding seg-
ment of text as relevant, by comparison to the Goal 
frame. The data frames are scored based on the number 
of conflicts found between them and the Goal frame. 
The conflicts are mismatches on values of correspond-
ing attributes. If a data frame is found to have no con-
flicts, it is given the highest relevance rank, and a con-
flict score of zero.  All other data frames are scored with 
 a decreasing value based on the number of conflicts, 
negative one for frames with one conflict with the Goal 
frame, negative two for two conflicts etc.  Frames that 
conflict with all information found in the question are 
given a score of -99 indicating the lowest relevancy 
rank.  Currently, frames with a conflict score of -99 are 
excluded from further processing as outliers. The frame 
in Figure 2 is scored as a near miss and will generate 
dialogue, where the user will decide whether or not it 
should be included in the answer space. 
5   Clarification Dialogue 
Data frames with a conflict score of zero form the 
initial kernel answer space. Depending upon the pres-
ence of other frames outside of this set, the system ei-
ther proceeds to generate the answer or initiates a dia-
logue with the user.  HITIQA begins asking the user 
questions on these near-miss frame groups, with the 
largest group first.  The groups must be at least groups 
of size N, where N is a user controlled setting.  This 
setting restricts all of HITIQA?s generated dialogue.   
A one conflict frame has only a single attribute 
mismatch with the Goal frame. This could be a mis-
match on any of the General attributes, for example, 
LOCATION, or ORGANIZATION, or TIME, etc., or in one of 
the domain specific attributes, TRANSFER_TO, or TRANS-
FER_TYPE, etc.  A special case arises when the conflict 
occurs on the TOPIC attribute.  Since all other attributes 
match, we may be looking at potentially different events 
or situations involving the same entities, or occurring at 
the same location or time. The purpose of the clarifica-
tion dialogue in this case is to probe which of these top-
ics may be of interest to the user.  Another special case 
arises when the Goal frame is of a different type than a 
data frame.  The purpose of the clarification dialogue in 
this case is to expand the user?s answer space into a 
different but possibly related event.  A combination of 
both of these cases is illustrated in the exchange in Fig-
ure 4 below.   
User: ?Where does al-Qaida have training facili-
ties?? 
HITIQA: ?Do you want to see material on the trans-
fer of weapons and intelligence to al-Qaida?? 
FIGURE 4: Dialogue generated by HITIQA for the al-Qaida 
training facilities question 
 
In order to understand what happened here, we need 
to note first that the Goal frame for this example is a 
General Frame, from Figure 2.  One of the data frames 
that caused this dialogue to be generated is shown in 
Figure 3 above.  While this frame is of a different frame 
type than the Goal frame, namely WMD Transfer, it 
matches on all of the General attributes except TOPIC, so 
HITIQA asks the user if they would like to expand their 
answer space to this other domain, namely to include 
the transfer of weapons involving this organization as 
well.

Qaida training facilities question 
 
During the dialogue, as new information is obtained 
from the user, the Goal frame is updated and the scores 
of all the data frames are reevaluated. The system may 
interpret the new information as a positive or negative. 
Positives are added to the Goal frame. Negatives are 
stored in a Negative-Goal frame and will also be used in 
the re-scoring of the data frames, possibly causing con-
flict scores to increase. If the user responds the equiva-
lent of ?yes? to the system clarification question in Fig-
ure 4, a corresponding WMD Transfer frame would be 
added to the Goal frame and all WMD Transfer frames 
will be re-scored.  If the user responds ?no?, the Nega-
tive-Goal frame will be generated and all WMD Trans-
fer frames will be rescored to 99 in order to remove 
them from further processing.  The user may end the 
dialogue, at any point and have an answer generated 
given the current state of the frames.   
Currently, the answer is simply composed of text 
passages from the zero conflict frames. In addition, 
HITIQA will generate a ?headline? for the text passages 
in all the Frames in the answer space.  This is done us-
ing grammar rules and the attributes of a frame.  Figure 
 5 shows a portion of the answer generated by HITIQA 
for the al-Qaida training facilities question. 
 
6   HITIQA Interface 
There are two distinct ways for the user to interact 
with HITIQA to explore their answer space.  The An-
swer Panel displays the user?s current answer at any 
given time during the interaction for a single question.  
Through this panel the user can read the paragraphs that 
are currently in their answer.  There are links on this 
panel so the user is able to view the full original source 
document from which the passage(s) were extracted. 
 The Visual panel offers the user an alternative to 
reading text by providing a tool for visually browsing 
the entire answer space.  Figure 6 shows a typical view 
of the visualization panel. The spheres are representa-
tive of single frames and groups of frames.  The user?s 
attention may be drawn to particular frames by the color 
coding or the attribute spikes.  The colors represent the 
frame?s score, so the user can quickly see what is in 
their answer, blue, and what is not, all other colors.  The 
attribute spikes may also be used as a navigation tool.  
The active attribute is chosen by the user through radio 
buttons. The current active attribute in Figure 6, is Lo-
cation.  This displays all instances of locations men-
tioned in the corresponding text. 
 
 
        Figure 6: Frame Level Display 
 
The underlying text that was used to build the frame 
may be displayed in the lower right hand window.  In 
this text display window there is a hyperlink that takes 
the user directly to the full source document. The user is 
able to interact with this panel by adding and removing 
information from their generated answer. Moving from 
the visualization to the textual dialogue, the generated 
answer, and back is seamless in a sense that any 
changes to the frame scores in one modality are imme-
diately accessible to the user in another modality. Users 
can add and remove frames from the answer space and 
HITIQA will always seamlessly pickup a new dialogue 
or generate a new answer.  
 
7   HITIQA Qualitative Evaluations 
In order to assess our progress thus far, and to also 
develop metrics to guide future evaluation, we invited a 
group of analysts employed by the US government to 
participate in two three-day workshops held in Septem-
ber and October 2003.  
The two basic objectives of the workshops were: 
1. To perform a realistic assessment of the useful-
ness and usability of HITIQA as an end-to-end system, 
from the information seeker's initial questions to com-
pletion of a draft report.  
2. To develop metrics to compare the answers ob-
tained by different analysts and evaluate the quality of 
the support that HITIQA provides.     
Each of these objectives entails a particular chal-
lenge. Performing a realistic assessment of HITIQA is 
difficult because many of the resources that the analysts 
use, as well as the reports they produce, are classified 
and therefore inaccessible to researchers.  
Assessing the quality of the support that the system 
provides is not easy because analytical questions rarely 
have a single right answer. It is not obvious how to de-
fine, for example, the precision of the system. We there-
fore conducted an 'information unit' exercise, whose 
purpose was to determine whether the analysts could 
identify information building blocks in their reports, so 
that we could compare and contrast different reports.  
To obtain an adequate supply of appropriate text 
data to support extensive question answering sessions 
(1, 2, 3 and 4 hours long), we prepared a new corpus of 
approximately 1.2 Gbytes. This new corpus consists of 
the reports from the Center for Non-Proliferation Stud-
ies (CNS) collected for the AQUAINT Program, aug-
mented with a much larger collection of texts on similar 
subject matter mined from the web using Google1. The 
final corpus proved to be sufficient to support about 
three hours of use of HITIQA to ?solve? each of the 
scenarios. 
The first day of the first workshop was devoted to 
training, including a two-part proficiency test. HITIQA 
is a fairly complex system, that includes multiple layers 
of data processing and user interaction, and it was criti-
cal that the users are sufficiently ?fluent? if we were to 
measure their productivity. The analysts' primary task 
on the second day was preparation of reports in re-
sponse to the scenarios. 
                                                 
1 Google has kindly agreed to temporarily extend our 
usage license so we could collect the data over a short 
time. 
  The third day was devoted to quantitative and quali-
tative evaluation, discussed later. In addition, we asked 
the analysts to score each others reports, as well as to 
identify key information units in them. These informa-
tion units could be later compared across different re-
ports in order to determine their completeness.  
8   Workshop Results 
The results of the quantitative evaluations strongly vali-
date the approach that we have taken. These conclusions 
are confirmed by analysts comments gleaned both from 
the formal qualitative assessment and from informal 
discussion. As one analyst said, ?the system as it stands 
now, in my mind, gave me enough information to try to 
put together a 80% solution but ?I don't think you're 
ever gonna reach that 100% state.? At the same time, we 
learned a great deal about how analysts work. 
It is important to determine the realism of the sce-
narios used during the workshop relative to the analysts? 
current work tasks in order for any results to be mean-
ingful. Each analyst was asked a series of five questions 
such as, ?How realistic was the scenario?  In other 
words did it resemble tasks you could imagine perform-
ing at work?? These 5 questions were all relative to the 
realism and difficulty of the scenario tasks.  Analysts 
used a scale of 1 to 5 based on their agreement with the 
statements, where 5 was complete agreement.  Our 
mean score was 3.84, indicating our scenarios were real-
istic and of about average difficulty when compared to 
the work they normally perform.   
We have classified the type of passages that an ana-
lyst copied to their report into two categories, answer 
passages and additional information passages, see Fig-
ure 7 below.  The answer passages either exactly an-
swered the user?s initial question or supplied supporting 
information.  The additional passages do not answer the 
original question posed, but may have been added to the 
answer through dialogue, or through the user?s explora-
tion of document links offered.  This could be a piece of 
information needed to satisfy some other aspect of the 
scenario that they had not asked about yet, or possibly a 
topic the user had not even considered but found rele-
vant when it was presented to them. As can be seen 
there was a very large amount of ?additional? informa-
tion that the user copied to their report.  The amounts 
reported here are the averages for all of the analysts for 
both workshops.  This supports our hypothesis that ana-
lysts seldom seek just the exact answer, but they are 
also looking at adjacent, related information, much of 
which they retain for their report.  Note that there were a 
small number of passages that contained a combination 
of answer and additional information; these were added 
to answer.

Figure 8: Number of Passages Copied Vs. Those Viewed 
 
We should now establish the number of passages 
copied versus those viewed, relative to links and the 
answer.  Figure 8 above shows the total number of pas-
sages copied versus the total number of passages 
viewed.  It is seen that many more passages need to be 
viewed through full document links before a useful pas-
sage is found.  In comparison a much smaller number of 
answer passages need to be viewed from the Answer 
panel in order to find useful passages.   
All of the analysts? sessions were recorded using 
Camtasia.  Figure 9 shows an annotation created for a 
typical session.  Analysts were observed to utilize a 
range of varying strategies as they worked different 
scenarios and even while working different queries of 
the same scenario.  Figure 10 shows the statistics for 
each Analyst?s use of HITIQA while working on the 
scenarios during the two workshops (note that Analyst-4 
was only able to attend the first workshop and Analyst-1 
did not create a report for Scenario 2).  Some of the 
variations in strategies among the analysts while work-
ing the same scenario are quite striking.  For example, 
Scenario 4 was  worked quite  differently  by  Analyst-1  
 versus Analyst-2.  While Analyst-1 spent almost all of 
his/her  time in  the Visual Panel, Analyst-2 spent virtu-
ally all of his/her time in the Answer panel.  Analyst-1 
produced his/her report copying 52 paragraphs while 
Analyst 2 copied only 35.  There are also large varia-
tions in the number of questions asked for the same sce-
nario.  Examine scenario 5, where Analyst-3 asked a 
total of 11 questions and Analyst-2 only needed to ask 2 
questions.  Relative to this, Analyst-3, who asked a 
much larger number of questions, copied only 28 pas-
sages, whereas Analyst-2 copied 31.  These variations, 
as stated earlier in the paper, could be due to the nature 
of the task, the progress the analyst is making on the 
task, in addition to individual differences between ana-
lysts. For example, the difference in the number of 
questions asked between Analyst-2 and Analyst-3 for 
scenario 5 may be due to difference in search strategies 
employed, but may also reflect the amount of back-
ground knowledge of the topic.

There is, however, some consistency across the ana-
lysts in the amount of information retained per scenario. 
The charts are drawn in logarithmic scale, but it should 
be visible that scenarios 2 and 3 produced less interac-
tion and required less information to fulfill than scenar-
ios 4 and 5. It is also visible that scenario 1 required 
more questions to be asked and more exploration to be 
done in visual panel than other scenarios. 
Finally, it is important to provide some metric re-
garding the user?s overall satisfaction with their use of 
HITIQA.  At the end of each workshop Analysts were 
given a series of 17 questions, such as ?HITIQA helps 
me find important information?, shown in Figure 11, to 
assess their overall experience with the system.  Many 
of these questions were designed for the user to com-
pare HITIQA to the current tools they are using for this 
type of task.   Analysts again used a scale of 1 to 5 
based on their agreement with the statements.  The re-
sults were then converted, where 5 would always denote 
the best, and are shown in Figure 11 below.  It is impor-
tant to note that we scored highly overall, but addition-
ally we scored highly in the majority of questions rela-
tive to comparison of their current tools.  For example, 
for Question 14: ?Having HITIQA at work would help 
me find information faster than I can currently find it?, 
our mean score was 3.83.

In summary, the results from these two evaluations 
indicate that HITIQA, in its current state, is already 
competitive with the tools that the analysts are currently 
using in their work, supporting our overall approach to 
Analytical Question Answering.  HTIQA provides the 
user with a tool to find the passages needed to complete 
a report for a given scenario.  While working on a sce-
nario HITIQA has been shown to provide information 
which exactly answers the user?s question, and addi-
tionally HITIQA?s method brings to light other related 
information that the analyst retains in order to complete 
their report.
