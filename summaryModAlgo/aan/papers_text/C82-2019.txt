The complex task  of  producing a concordance c la ims a

appropr ia te  in ter face  in  man-machine in teract ion  to obta in

ac t ion  but computat iona l  l i ngu is t / l i te rary  exper t  in teract ion  
as well. And it might reveal the lack of lingulstlcally te- 
llable algorithms for a fully automatic approach to this 
problem. 
LDVLIB(LEM) doesn ' t  lenm~tize  automat ica l ly  but i t  
supports  lemmat iza t ion  as fo l lows .  I t  a l lows  to work on s ing -  
le  por t ions  o f  a text  and one or  more users  have access  to 
the on- l ine  machine d io t ions~7 at  the same t ime.  The user  
gets  p resented  on the sc reen:  
- 87  - 
- i n  the  upper  par t ,  from the  KWlC-concordance: 
every  token  to  be lemmat ized ,w i th  context  and re feren-  
ces  (page,  l ine)  
- in  the  lower  par t ,  from the  machine d ic t ionary :  
proposals of lemmatizing relative to the type shown 
i n .  the  upper  par t .  
In teract ive  lemmat iz ing  cons is ts  there fore  in  record ing  the  
(automat ica l ly  generated)  number of  the  conven ient  p roposa l  
in  the  l ine  of  the  token .  I f  there  doesn ' t  resu l t  any proposa l  
o r  not  a conven ient  one from the  machine d ic t ionary ,  the  user  
w i l l  inser t  innned ia te ly  the  conven ient  d ic t ionary  ent ry  and 
record  i t s  p roposa l  number in  the  upper  par t  o f  the  sc reen .  
Such a new proposa l  w i l l  be s tored  in  an add i t iona l  d ic t ionary  
that  i s  to  be t rans fer red  per iod ica l ly  in to  the  main d ic t ion -  
a ry .  
The always growing ~ch in  e d io t i cnar~ bases  on a nat ion -  
al language frequence vocabulary of about 25 "000 types includ- 
ing about 5;000 lemmata. There has been put a lot of care in 
the design of the information codes. The machine dictionary 
entries consist of 4 fields: type (inflected wordform), lemma 
(deflected keyword), lemma information and type information. 
The lamina information includes the following segments: 
- word class and additional informatlons 
- add i t iona l  lemmata (eno l i t io  a r t i c le ,  p ronouns)  
- d i sambiguat ion  of  homography 
- cross - re ference  to  the  s tandard  lemma ( to  be generated  
in  the  pr in ted  output ) :  
- graphic variant of the lamina (archaic writing) 
- alteration of the le.-.- (diminutive by suffixation) 
- short paraphrase in case of homonymy, where dlsambig- 
uation is default (in case of polysemy, where dis- 
ambiguation is optional) 
The type information includes the following segments: 
- 8 8  - 
- morpho log ica l  in fo rmat ion  (gender ,  number, person ,  
mood, tense ,  case ,  g radat ion)  
- morpho log ica l  var iants  (a rcha ic  in f lex ion)  
- g raph ic  var iants  (e l i s ion ,  shor t  form) 
- spec ia l ,  i . e .  id iomat ica l  use  
- re la t ion  to  a d i s t inc t  vocabu lary  (e .g .  f requence  
vocabu lary )  
The users  of  concordances  ( le - , , - t i zed  or  not )  have 
d i f fe rent  in teres ts .  In  l i te rar~ research  one may s tudy  the  
s i~E le  types  or  even mere ly  the  s ing le  tokens  of  a !e"""  in  
the  order  of  occur rence  in  a work. In  l ingu is t i c  research  one 
may be in teres ted  in  a lphabet ic  o rder  o f  the  types  and in  sub-  
sequent  a lphabet ic  o rder  of  the  r ight  context  of  the  s ing le  
tokens .  These two examples of  o rdered  concordances  don ' t  need 
the  type in fo rmat ion .  But the  type in fo rmat ion  as  prov ided  in  
our  machine d ic t ionary  w i l l  a l low to  get  s~ more soph is t i ca ted  
in terna l  o rder  of  the  lemmata: e .g .  s ingu lar  p receeds  p lura l ,  
pos i t i ve  preoeeds  comparat ive  and super la t ive ,  p resent  pre -  
ceeds  past ,  morpho log ica l  and graph ic  var iants  a re  d i s t ingu ish -  
ed or  not ,  id iomat ica l  uses  are  ordered  separate ly  or  not .  
The access  to  a lemmat ized concordance w i l l  be as  to  a 
data  base and the  l in@~tist  in teres ted  in  cer ta in  phenomena may 
se lec t  by opt ions  e .g .  the  substant ives  and ad jec t ives  on ly  
or  a l l  verbs  in  pass ive  const ruct ion .  LDVLIB(LEM) a l lows  a l -  
ways to  the  user  to  get  fu l l  p r in t  o f  the  lemnat i zed  concord -  
ance or  a reduced pr in t  of  a l i s t  o f  1 to  n lemmata. 
It will be shown that support of the philologist ?s work 
by a large dictionary is not only useful in concordance mak- 
ing, but as well cumulates a lot of material for subsequent 
lexicographic work. Looking ahead, two questions "must be con- 
sidered: the integration of a dictionary data base and the 
productive use of grammatical procedures like ATNs to shift 
balance between intellectual work and machine support in 
direction to "a little bit more automatic".
