new text. 
l~xperience with several language pairs has 
shown that producing a.n EBMT system which 
provides reasomt.ble t, ra.nsla.tion coverage of un- 
restricted texts using simple textual matching 
requires on the order of two million words of 
pre-translated texts (one million words in each 
l;mguage); if either la.nguage is highly in\[letting, 
polysynthetic, or (worse yet) a.gglu tina.tive, even 
llloro text will be required. It ma.y I)e difficult, 
time-consuming, and expensive to obtain tha.t 
much pa.rallel text, pa.rtieula.rly for lesser-used 
la.nguage pairs. Thus, it' one' wishes to develop 
a. new tr,~nslator ra.pidly a.nd a.t low cost, tech-

2 Conver t ing  the  Prob lem 
The task of clustering words a.ccording to their 
occurrence pa, tterns ca, n 1)e testa,ted as a, sta, n- 
dard document-clustering task by converting 
the l)rol)lem sl)a.ce. For each unique word to be 
clllstered, crea.te a. l)seudo-doculnent conta.ining 
the words of the contexts in which theft word N)- 
125 
pears, and use the word itself as tile document 
identifier. After the pseudo-documents are clus- 
tered, retrieving the identitier for each docu- 
ment in a particular cluster l)roduces tile list of 
words occurring in su\[\[iciently similar contexts 
to be considered equivalent \['or the l)urposes of 
generalizing an EBM(1 ~ system. 
By itself, this approach only produces a 
monolingual clustering, but we require a, bilin- 
gum clustering fox" proper generalization since 
different senses of a word will appear in differing 
contexts. The method of Barrachina and Vilar 
(1999) provides the means for injecting bilingual 
information into the clustering process. 
Using a bilingual dictionary - -  which may be 
created fl'om the corl)us using statistical meth- 
()<Is, such as those of Peter \]~rown el al (71990) or 
the author's own l)r(~viotls? work (Brown, 11997) 
and the parallel text, create a rough ma.pping 
1)etween the words in the source-language half of 
each translation example in tile corpus and tile 
target-language half el'that example. Whenever 
there is exactly one l)ossible translation candi- 
date listed for a word by the mapping, generate 
a bilingual word pair consisting of the word and 
its translation. This word pair will be treated 
as an indivisible token in further processing, 
adding bilingual information to the clustering 
process. \]eorming 1)airs in this manner causes 
each distinct translation of a. word to be treated 
as a separate sense; although translation pairs 
do not exactly correspond to word senses, pairs 
can be formed without any additional knowl- 
edge sonrces and are what tile EBM:I' systern 
requires for its equivalence classes. 
1,'or every unique word pair found in the 1)re- 
vious step, we a.ccurnulate counts for each word 
in the surrounding context of its occurrences. 
The context of ~n occurrence is defined to be 
tile N words immediately prior to and the N 
words immediately following the occurrence; N 
currently is set to 3. Because word order is im- 
portant, counts are accumulated separately for 
each position within the context, i.e. for N = 3, 
a particular context word may contribute to any 
of six different counts, depending on its loca- 
tion relative to the occurrence. Further, as the 
distance ffoln the occurrence increases, the sur- 
rounding words become less likely to be a true 
part of the word-pair's context, so tile counts 
are weighted to give the greatest importance 
to the words immediately adjacent o the word 
pair being examined. Currently, a silnple linear 
decay fl'om 1.0 to -~ is used, but other decay 
functions such as the reciprocal of the distance 
are also possible. Tile resulting weighted set of 
word counts tbrms the above-mentioned I)seudo- 
document which is converted into a term vector 
Ibr cosine similarity computations (a standaM 
measure in information retrieval, defined as the 
dot product of two term vectors normalized to 
unit length), 
If the clustering is seeded with a. set of ini- 
tial equivalence classes (which will be discussed 
below), then the equivalences will be used to 
generalize the contexts as they are added to tile 
overall counts \['or tile word pair. Any words in 
the context for which a unique correspondence 
can be found (and f'or which the word and its 
corresponding translation are one of the pah:s 
in an equivalence class) will be counted as if the 
name of the equivMence class had been l)resent 
in the text rather than the original word. For 
example, if days of the week are an equivalence 
class, then ':(lid he come on Fridas:' and "did 
he leave on Mends3:' will yield identical con- 
text vectors for "come" and "leave", maldng it 
easier \['or those two terms to chlster together. 
To illustrate the conversion process, consider 
tile li'rench word "('inq" in two examl)les where 
it translates into English as ::five" (thus forming 
tile word pair "cinq_fi ve") : 
<NUt> <NI/L> Le ci,zq jours dcpuis la 
<NUL> <NUL> 73e five dags si~zce lhe 
ellcs com'me~,cc~w~,t c~z cinq jours .<NUL> 
they will begin i~), five days .<NUL> 
where <NUt> is used as a placeholder when 
the word pair is too near the beginning or end 
of the sentence for the flfll context o be present. 
Note that the word order on the target-language 
side \]s not considered when building the term 
vector, so it need llOt be the same as on the 
source-language side; the examples were chosen 
with the same word order merely for clarity. 
The resulting ternl vector for "cinqJive" is 
a.s follows, where the numbers in parentheses 
indicate the context word's position relative to 
the word pair under consideration: 
Word Occur Weight 
<NWl.>(-3) 1 0.333 
elles(-3) 1 0.333 
1 0.667 
commenceront(-2) 1 0.667 
Le(q) 1 1.ooo 
en(-1) 1 1.000 
jours(J) 2 2.000 
depuis(2) 1 0.667 
.(2) 1 0.667 
la(3) 1 0.333 
<NUL>(3)  1 0.333 
Term vectors such as tile above are then clus- 
tered to determine equivalent usages among 
words.

On its own, clustering is quite suc(:essfill for 
generalizing EBMT ('Xaml)les, I)ut the fully- 
a.utomated t)roducl;ion of clusters is not com- 
t)a.tible with adding a, l)roduction-rule gra.mma.r 
as (lcscril)od in (l~rown, \]999). Therel'ore, the 
clustering process may 1)e seeded with a. set of 
m an u a.lly-gc'nera.ted clusters. 
VVhell seed clusters m'e a.va.ilablo., the cluster- 
ins process is moditied in two ways. First, l;he 
grOUl)-avera.ge a.pl)roa.clms a.dd an initiaJ clusl;er 
for o.a,('h soed cluslcr and the a.gglolnera.tive a p- 
127 
proaches add an initial cluster for each word 
pair; these initial clusters are tagged with the 
name of the seed cluster. Second, whenever a
tagged chister is merged with an untagged one 
or another cluster with the same tag, the com- 
bination inherits the tag; further, merging two 
clusters with different ags is disallowed. As a 
result, the initial seed chlsters are expanded by 
adding additional word pairs while preventing 
any of the seed clusters from themselves inerg- 
ing with each other. 
One special case is handled sepa.rately, 
namely numeric strings. If both the source- 
language and target-l~mguage words of a word 
pair are numeric strings, the word pair is treated 
as if it had been specified ill the seed class 
<number>.  Word pairs not containing a digit 
in either word can optionally be prevented fi'om 
being added to the <number> chlster unless 
explicitly seeded in that cluster. The former 
feature eusures that nunibers will apl)ear in a. 
single cluster, rather than in multiple chlsters. 
The latter avoids the inclusion of the many non- 
numeric word pairs (primarily adjectives) which 
would otherwise tend to cluster with numbers, 
because both they and numbers are used as 
modifiers. 
Once clustering is completed, any clusters 
which have inherited the same tag (which is 
possible when using agglomerative clustering) 
are merged. Those clusters which contain more 
than one pseudo-document areoutput,  together 
with any inherited label, a.nd can be used as a 
set of equivalence classes for EBMT. 
Agglomerative chlstering using the maximal 
cosine sinfila.rity (single-link) produced the sub- 
jectively best clusters, and was used for the ex- 
periments described here. 
4 Exper iment  
The Inethod described in the previous two 
sections was tested on French-English EBMT. 
The training corpus was a subset of the 1BM 
Ilansard corpns of Canadian parliamentary pro- 
ceedings (Linguistic Data Consortium, 1997), 
containing a total of slightly more than one 
million words, approximately half in each lan- 
guage. Word-level alignment between French 
and English was pertbrmed using a dictio- 
nary containing entries derived statistically 
from the full Hansard corpus, auglnented by 
the ARTH, French-English did;iona.ry (ARTFL 
Project, 1998). This dictionary was used for all 
EBMT and chlstering runs. 
The efl'ects of varying the amount of train- 
ing texts were determined by further sl)litting 
the training corl)us into smaller seglnents aM 
using differing numbers of segments. For each

Figure 3 shows how adding a.utoma.tically- 
generated equiva.lence classes sul)sta.ntially in- 
c reases  the covers,we of the EI3MT system. A1- 
terna.tively, lnuch less text is required to rea.ch 
a. specific level of coverage. The lowest curve in 
the. graph is tile percentage of the d5,000-word 
test text for which the EI{M:J' system was able 
to genera.te tra.nsla.tions when using strict lexi- 
c+d matching against the trahling corpus. The 
lop-most curve shows the best performa.nce, pre- 
viously achieved using 1)oth a, la.rge set of eqttiva- 
lento classes (in t;he fornt of tagged entries from

(lutes the required trahling text; even further; 
this ca.n la.rgely be attril)uted to the merging of

Adding the production-rule gratnma.r to the 
seeded clustering had little effect. When usirtg 
more than 50,000 words of tra.ining text, the in- 
crease in coverage from adding the gram m a,r was 
negligible, and even with the sma.llest raining

'l'he 1)rogram also runs reasonably quickly. 
The step of creating context term vectors con- 
verts approximately 500,000 words of raw text 
per minute on a 300 MHz processor. 1,'or ag- 
glomerative clustering, the processing time is 
roughly quadratic in the number of word \])airs, 
with a theoretical cubic worst case; the 17,527 
distinct word pairs found from the million-word 
training corpus require about 25 minutes to 
cluster. 
6 D iscuss ion  
One statement made earlier deserves cla.rifica- 
tion: l;he members of ~ cluster need not be re- 
lated to each other in any way, either syntacti- 
cally or semantically, for a cluster to be useful 
and correct. This is because (absent a gram- 
mar) we do not care about the features of tile 
words in the cluster, only wh, cthc~" their tr(msla- 
lion,s Jbllow the same pattcrT~. 
An illustration based on actual experience 
is useful here. In early testing of the group- 
average clustering algorithm with seeding, the 
<con junct ion> seed class of "and" and "or" 
was used. Clustering augmented this seed class 
with "," (comma.), "in", and %y". One can eas- 
ily see tha.t the comma is a valid member of the 
class, since it takes the place of "and" in lists 
of items. 13ut wllat about ':in" and "135;", wlfich 
are prepositions rather than conjunctions2 11' 
one considers the tra.nsbttion t)attern

it becomes clear that all of the terms in the 
expanded class give a correct translation when 
placed in the blank in this pattern, lndeed, 
one could imagine a production-rule grammar 
geared toward taking advmltage of such com- 
mon translation patterns regardless of conven- 
tional linguistic features. 
7 Conc lus ion  and  Future  Work  
Using word clustering to automatically gener- 
alize the example corpus of an I;BM'I? system 
can provide the majority of tile improvement 
which can be achieved using both ~ manually- 
generated set of equivalence ('lasses and a pro- 
duct;ion rule grammar. The use of a set of small 
initial equivalence classes produces a substan- 
tial further reduction in training text at a very 
low cost (a few hours) in lal)or.
