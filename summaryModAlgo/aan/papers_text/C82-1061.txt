One of the major tasks of the quantitative se- 
mantic analysis is to disclose complex rela- 
tions of sememes in communication, i.e. on the 
basis of their associations in the frame of syn- 
tactic structures. With the aid of computer it 
is possible to prepare a corpus of language ma- 
terial giving the possibi l ity to quantify /I./ 
semantics of syntactic functions, /2./ lexical 
meanings, /3./ meanings of morphological cate- 
gories, esp. those of parts of speech, and to 
create a new type of semantic frequency dictio- 
nary. 
The assistance of computer in present-day quantitative linguistic 
studies makes possible to quantify not only language events, but 
also their relations, not only their static features, but also 
the dynamic tendencies of language. This refers, in the first 
place, to the phenomena of lexicon where the application of quan- 
titative methods as well as the modern computer processing have 
been of a certain tradition; but the computer-aided research is 
applied on other language levels, too, e.g. in graphemics, pho- 
nemics, morphemics, and can be performed also in morphology and 
syntax. Thus, the contribution of L. UhliFov& a. collaborators, 
workers of the Dept. of Mathematical Linguistics and Phonetics of 
the Czech Language Institute, informed about the computer-aided 
quantif ication of patterns of simple, compound, and complex sen- 
tences and about'their close relationship to the morphological 
#rid lexical Levels.

phenomena. In th is  stage of analysis the computer is an indispen- 
sable instrument of research. 
Let us remember in th is  place the th i r t ies  and f i f t ies  of this 
century when the f i r s t  semantic frequency d ic t ionar ies  of English 
were - manually - compiled \ [ I \ ] ,  \ [2\] .  They were isolated achieve- 
ments combining quant i tat ive and qua l i ta t ive  approaches to obtain 
the frequency of ind iv idua l  lex ica l  meanings. 
In the Dept. of Mathematical L inguist ics and Phonetics, we dispose 
with a s ta t i s t i ca l  corpus of texts processed by computer the units 
of which /words/ havebeen encoded in context with regard to syn- 
tax, morphology and lexicon; the corpus provides an adequate basis 
for the quant i f icat ion of the so-called context meaning, i .e .  
meaning in a certain context \[3~. 
As i t  is known, a discourse is determined by external and internal  
l i ngu is t i c  condit ions, in other words, i t  is a function of l ingu- 
i s t i c  and ext ra l ingu is t i c  var iables.  The complex relat ions between 
objects and other events of rea l i ty  are ref lected in language by 
syntagmatic and paradigmatic re lat ions ;  to disclose the i r  mutual 
condit ioning is one of the major aims of the semantic analysis.  
The lexicon introducing the sememes within the i r  proper systems is 
not capable to cope with the i r  complex re lat ions in the communica- 
t ion,  and, thus, i t  is necessary to examine the l ink ing of sememes 
in the frame of syntactic structure. This is a task which cannot 
be done without an assistance ~f computer, especia l ly  when the re- 
lat ions are to be quant i f ied.  And, at the same time, this  is a 
task which ought to be performed by the quant i tat ive  l ingu is t i cs  
as a f i r s t  step to the quant i f icat ion of meaning which is today at 
the centre of interest  in l ingu is t i cs ,  logic and other sciences. 
A prerequis i te for obtaining good results in the semantic research 
is a computationally processed corpus of l i ngu is t i c  units /sentence 
tokens/ in which we may quantify:  /1 . /  semantics of syntactic 
functions, /2 . /  l ex ica l  meanings by means of which the semantics 
of sentence elements are expressed, /3 . /  meanings of morphological 
categories, especia l ly  those of parts of speech, when they prove 
to be of importance for semantics in points /1 . /  and /2 . / .  
On th i s  sub jec t  we add a few remarks .  To po in t  /1 . / :  I t  i s  we l l

known that in spite of a considerable progress in sentence seman- 
tics in these last years ~4\], \[5\], there is a number of questions 
remaining unsolved or open. Nevertheless, we are able to quantify 
semantics on the sentence level applying the principles of L. Tes- 
nitre \[6\]. The approach consists in searching for semantic compo- 
nents corresponding to sentence members in different syntactic 
functions. This is certainly no easy task, but is possible under 
the condition that we dispose with a perfectly performed syntactic 
analysis of whole sentences /simple, compound, and complex/ and 
larger samples of running texts, as is the sampling used inthe Depto 
of Mathematical Linguistics for the mentioned corpus of texts.  
This sort of underlying language material allows us to study the 
semantics of language units even larger than a sentence - this, 
however, being a prospect for a future work. 
Remarks to point /2./: The study of lexical meanings fixed ~n ex- 
planatory dictionaries shows some interesting aspects, too. The 
analysis based on their distr ibution in text and in relation to the 
respective semantics of syntactic functions gives a new picture of 
the frequency distr ibution of different context meanings associated 
with a word, and, in some cases, even corrects their position with 
regard to morphological categories. 
Remarks to point /3./: Each part of speech, of course, "behaves" 
in a different way as far as the semantics of syntactic functions 
and the lexical meanings are concerned; sometimes, the meaning can 
be signif icantly influenced also by morphological categories. 
E.g. the animate and inanimate genders of masculines in Czech con- 
cern not only the semantics of the analyzed word, but also its 
"environment". So for example, the animateness of subject /e.g. 
agent/, or object /e.g. afficient/, is reflected in the verb /pre- 
dicate/ and also is connected with certain lexical meanings; simi- 
larly, the verb categories /e.g. mood and tense/ often influence 
the use of lexical meanings as well as the constitution of new mea- 
nings. 
These assertions will be now exemplif ied on two fundamental parts 
of speech, the verb and the noun, which in the quantitative seman- 
tic analysis manifest some specific features referring to their 
part-of-speech properties and syntactic functions.

E.g. the Czech verb in the predicat ive posit ion represents toge 
ther with i t s  actants the semantic nucleus of sentence. The actants 
are formally expressed by the subject, object and/or adverbials as 
free complements. After the determination of meanings correspon- 
ding to the syntactic functions of verb as a further step we ascer- 
tain which of the lex ica l  meanings functions most frequently as 
predicate. The semantics of predicate may be also ingluenced by the 
part-of-speech appurtenance of actantsassigned tosyntact ic funct ions .  
assigned. I t  cer ta in ly  makes a difference when a subject is ex- 
pressed by a noun or a pronoun, or when i t  is not expressed at a l l .  
There are other important aspects, too, e.g. whether the function 
of subject /e.g.  agent/ is expressed by an animate or an inanimate 
noun, whether i t  is a human being, animal or thing, whether the 
word stands in the singular or the plurals whether i t  is p lurale 
tantum etc. In the re lat ion of object to predicate we must take 
into account the lex ica l  meaning of object and i t s  morphological 
categories, especial ly case. 
Between the verb, subject and object there exists a relation of se- 
mantic congruence, i.e. a c lassi f icatory agreement of noun and verb 
/i.e. of the predicate and its actants/. E.g. water, wine flows._.,__~_~_# 
not so the table, the earth~ we chase the d ~  not ~ .  
This principle is rather close to the intention of verb in the 
sense of E. Pauliny \[7\]. 
With the noun in Czech we quantify the semantics corresponding 
especial ly to subject, object, attr ibute and adverbial.  Compared to 
the previous remarks on the semantic quanti f icat ion of verb we have 
to do for the most part with an inverse relation; as a point of de- 
parture we take now the noun in one of its syntactic functions 
/with different meanings/ and procede to the verb syntact ical ly 
functioning as a predicate. Further steps of analysis are practi- 
cally the same as with the verb, i.e. the determinat ion of a corres- 
ponding lexical meaning of the given noun, of its morphological  ca- 
tegories and/or syntactic functions of i t s  ='environment." With the, 
adverbial the attent ion is paid especial ly to whether i t  is obl iga-  
tory or optional .\[5\]. 
The semantic analysis of the remaining parts of speech in sentence, 
e.g. formal words /grammar words/, such as preposit ions and conjunc- 
tionss have some aspects common with verbs or nouns and, in addition, 
QUANTIFICATION OF MEANING AND THE COMPUTER 381 
some special features connected with the i r  status. In any case, 
the quant i f icat ion of the i r  semantics in the manner explained shows 
the functioning of wobds in text in a new l ight .  
The quant i tat ive Linguist ics can fu l f i l l  the task presented with 
the aid of computer which creates optimum conditions for the app l i -  
cation of quant i tat ive methods in semantics. Within the quantita- 
t ive microanalysis Qf ind iv idual  words in text / in  context/ aimed 
at an ident i f i ca t ion  of context meaning i t  is possible to obtain 
new facts concerning the theory of semantics in general and the 
quant i tat ive semantics in special~ the appl icat ion of results may 
lead to a new type of semantic frequency d ic t ionary .  And th is  is 
at present, under my leadership, the pr inc ipa l  task of the Dept. 
of Mathematical L inguist ics and Phonetics, in the Czech Language
