Abstract 
This paper discusses several issues in Arabic 
orthography that were encountered in the 
process of performing morphology analysis 
and POS tagging of 542,543 Arabic words in 
three newswire corpora at the LDC during 
2002-2004, by means of the Buckwalter 
Arabic Morphological Analyzer. The most 
important issues involved variation in the 
orthography of Modern Standard Arabic that 
called for specific changes to the Analyzer 
algorithm, and also a more rigorous definition 
of typographic errors. Some orthographic 
anomalies had a direct impact on word 
tokenization, which in turn affected the 
morphology analysis and assignment of POS 
tags. 
1 Introduction 
In 2002 the LDC began using output from the 
Buckwalter Arabic Morphological Analyzer 
(Buckwalter, 2002), in order to perform 
morphological annotation and POS tagging of 
Arabic newswire text. From 2002 to 2004 three 
corpora were analyzed and over half a million 
Arabic word tokens were annotated and tagged 
(see Table 1).1

were published as ?Arabic Treebank: Part 1 v 2.0? 
(Maamouri 2003),  ?Arabic Treebank: Part 2 v 2.0? 
(Maamouri 2004), and ?Arabic Treebank: Part 3 v 1.0? 
(Maamouri 2004), respectively, and are available from 
the LDC website <http://www.ldc.upenn.edu >  
The author was responsible for developing and 
maintaining the Analyzer, which primarily 
involved filling in the gaps in the lexicon and 
modifying the POS tag set in order to meet the 
requirements of treebanking efforts that were 
performed subsequently at the LDC with the same 
annotated and POS-tagged newswire data. 
2 Lessons from the AFP corpus 
During the tagging of the AFP data, the first 
corpus in the series, the Buckwalter Analyzer was 
equipped to handle basic orthographic variation 
that often goes unnoticed because it is a common 
feature of written Arabic (Buckwalter, 1992). This 
orthographic variation involves the writing (or 
omission) of hamza above or below alif in stem-
initial position, and to a lesser extent, the writing 
(or omission) of madda on alif, also in stem-initial 
position. In both cases use of the bare alif without 
hamza or madda is quite common and goes by 
unnoticed by most readers. What took the LDC 
morphology annotation team by surprise was to 
find that in the AFP data the common omission of 
hamza in this environment had been extended to 
stem-medial and stem-final positions as well, as 
seen in the following words from that corpus: ????  
????  ??????   ???  ??????   ?????  ?????   ????? .  
This type of orthographic variation was not 
attested to the same extent in the two subsequent 
corpora, Ummah and Annahar, which leads us to 
conclude that some orthographic practices might 
be restricted to specific news agencies. It is 
important to note that most of the native Arabic 
speakers who annotated the AFP data using the 
output from the Analyzer did not regard these 
omissions of hamza on alif in stem-medial and 
stem-final positions as orthographic errors, and 
fully expected the Analyzer to provide a solution. 
3 Lessons from the Ummah corpus 
During the tagging of the Ummah data, a 
different set of orthographic issues arose. Although 
the Buckwalter Analyzer was equipped to handle 
so-called ?Egyptian? spelling (where word-final 
ya? is spelled without the two dots, making it 
identical to alif maqsura), the Ummah corpus 
presented the LDC annotation team with just the 
opposite phenomenon: dozens of word-final alif 
maqsura?s spelled with two dots.2  Whereas some 
of the affected words were automatically rejected 
as typographical errors (e.g., ???  ????  ??????  ?????  
???? ), others where gladly analyzed at face value 
(e.g., ???  ???  ??? ). Unfortunately, this led to 
numerous false positive analyses: for example ???  
was analyzed as ?ali and ?alayya, but not as ?ala. 
Initially, these words were tagged as typographical 
errors, but their pervasiveness led the LDC team to 
reconsider this position, upon which the author was 
asked to modify the Analyzer algorithm in order to 
accommodate this typographic anomaly. As a 
result, all words ending in ya? were now re-
interpreted as ending in either ya? or alif maqsura, 
and both forms were analyzed, as seen in the 
following (abridged) output:3

4 Lessons from all three corpora 
The Annahar corpus presented no orthographic 
surprises, or at least nothing that the LDC 
annotation team had not seen before. The Annahar 
data did contain some additional orthographic 
                                                     
2 It is not entirely clear whether these ?dotted? alif 
maqsura?s were produced by human typists or by an 
encoding conversion process gone awry. It is possible 
that the original keyboarding was done on a platform 
where word-final ya? and alif maqsura are displayed via 
visually identical ?un-dotted? glyphs, so it makes no 
difference which of the two keys the typist presses on 
the keyboard: both produce the same visual display, but 
are stored electronically as two different characters.

features that we now identify as being common to 
all three corpora, as well as corpora outside the set 
we have annotated at the LDC.  
The first orthographic feature relates to the 
somewhat free interchange of stem-initial hamza 
above alif and hamza below alif. With some lexical 
items the orthographic variation simply reflects 
variation in pronunciation: for example, both 
?isbaniya (with hamza under alif) and ?asbaniya 
(with hamza above alif) are well attested. But in 
cases involving other orthographic pairs, more 
interpretations are possible. Take, for instance, 
what we called the ?qala ?anna? problem. This 
problem was identified after numerous encounters 
with constructions in which qala was followed by 
?anna rather than ?inna, and for no apparent 
linguistic reason. Initially this was treated as a 
typographical error, but again, its pervasiveness 
forced us to take a different approach.  
One solution we considered was to modify the 
Analyzer algorithm so that instances of stem-initial 
hamza on alif would also be treated as possible 
instances of hamza under alif, very much in the 
spirit of the approach we used for dealing with the 
alif maqsura / ya? free variation cited earlier. 
However, there is compelling evidence that the 
orthography of hamza in stem-initial position is a 
fairly reliable indication of the perceived value of 
subsequent short vowel: a or u for hamza above 
alif, and i for hamza below alif. In other words, 
there is no free variation. The decision was taken 
to regard ?qala ?anna? constructions as gram-
matically acceptable in MSA.4 
5 Concatenation in Arabic orthography 
The second, and more serious, orthographic 
anomaly we encountered in all three corpora is 
what we call the problem of Arabic ?run-on? 
words, or free concatenation of words when the 
word immediately preceding ends with a non-
connector letter, such as alif, dal, dhal, ra, za, 
waw, ta marbuta, etc.  
The most frequent ?run-on? words in Arabic are 
combinations of the high-frequency function words 
la and ma (which end in alif) with following 
perfect or imperfect verbs, such as la-yazal, ma-
yuram, and ma-zala ( ??????  ??????  ????? ). The la of 
?absolute negation? concatenates freely with 
nouns, as in la-budda, la-shakka ( ????  ???? ). It can 
be argued that these are lexicalized collocations, 
but their spelling with intervening space ( ????  ?? ? 
                                                     
4 Badawi, Carter and Gully regard ?qala ?anna? 
constructions as grammatical but restricted to contexts 
?where the exact words of the speaker are not used or 
reported? (Badawi, Carter and Gully 2004, p. 713). This 
assertion could be investigated in the LDC corpora. 
???  ??   ? ??  ??) is just as frequent as their spelling in 
concatenated form. 
Proper name phrases, especially those involving 
the word ?abd ( ????????  ????????? ) are also written 
either separately or in concatenated form. Part of 
the data annotation process at the LDC involves 
assigning case endings to tokenized words, but 
there is currently no mechanism in the Analyzer to 
assign two case endings (or several pairs of POS 
tags) to what is being processed as a single word 
token. As a result of this, the phrase ?abd allah is 
assigned a single POS tag and case ending when it 
is written in concatenated form, but two POS tags 
and two case endings when written with 
intervening space. 
The problem of assigning more than one case 
ending and POS tag to concatenations is more 
obvious in fully lexicalized concatenations such as 
khamsumi?atin, sittumi?atin, sab?umi?atin, etc 
( ???????  ? ??????  ? ??????? ). When these numbers are 
written with intervening space ( ????  ???  ? ????  ??  ? 
????  ??? ), two case endings and two POS tags are 
assigned by the Analyzer. But when they are 
written in concatenated form only one case ending 
and POS tag is assigned, and the ?infixed? case 
ending of the first token is left undefined: 
khamsmi?atin, sittmi?atin, sab?mi?atin, etc. 5 
So far we have discussed relatively controlled 
concatenation, involving mostly high-frequency 
function words and lexicalized phrases. But 
concatenation extends beyond that to random 
combinations of words?the only requirement 
being that the word immediately preceding end 
with a non-connector letter. These concatenations 
are fairly frequent, as attested by their Google 
scores (see Table 2).  
It is important to note that these concatenations 
are not immediately obvious to readers due to the 
characteristics of proportionally spaced Arabic 
fonts. Most of the native readers of Arabic at the 
LDC did not consider concatenations such as these 
to be typographical errors. Their logic was best 
expressed in the statement: ?I can read the text just 
fine. Why can?t the Morphological Analyzer?? 
 
                                                     
5 We regard these as ?fully lexicalized? 
concatenations because the first of the two constituent 
tokens ends in a connector letter. In other word, their 
concatenation is deliberate and not an accident of 
orthography.

6 Conclusion 
There are several levels of orthographic variation 
in Arabic, and each level calls for a specific 
response to resolve the orthographic anomaly. It is 
important that the output analysis record which 
method was used to resolve the anomaly. The 
methods used for resolving orthographic anomaly 
range from exact matching of the surface 
orthography to various strategies of orthography 
manipulation. Each manipulation strategy carries 
with it certain assumptions about the text, and 
these assumptions should be part of the output 
analysis. For example, an analysis of ???  obtained 
by exact matching in a text known to contain 
suspicious word-final ya?s (that may be alif 
maqsura?s) does not have the same value as an 
analysis of the same word, using the same exact 
matching, but in a text where word-final ya?s and 
alif maqsura?s display normal character 
distribution frequencies. 
The problem of run-on words in Arabic calls for 
a reassessment of current tokenization strategies, 
including the definition of ?word token? itself. 6 It 
should be assumed that each input string represents 
one or more potential word tokens, each of which 
needs to be submitted individually for morphology 
analysis. For example, the input string ?????  can be 
segmented as a single word token, yielding two 
morphological analyses (faqad-tum and fa-qud-
tum) or it can be segmented as two word tokens 
(fqd tm), yielding several possible analysis pairs 
(faqada / fuqida / faqd / fa-qad +  tamma). 
                                                     
6 By ?tokenization? we mean the identification of 
orthographically valid character string units that can be 
submitted to the Analyzer for analysis. The Analyzer 
itself performs a different kind of ?tokenization? by 
identifying prefixes and suffixes that are bound 
morphemes but which may be treated as ?word tokens? 
in syntactic analysis. 
Syntactic analysis would be needed for 
determining which morphology analysis is most 
likely the correct one for each tokenization (fqdtm 
and fqd tm).
