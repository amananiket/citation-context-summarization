Abstract
This paper describes an empirical study
of high-performance dependency parsers
based on a semi-supervised learning ap-
proach. We describe an extension of semi-
supervised structured conditional models
(SS-SCMs) to the dependency parsing
problem, whose framework is originally
proposed in (Suzuki and Isozaki, 2008).
Moreover, we introduce two extensions re-
lated to dependency parsing: The first ex-
tension is to combine SS-SCMs with an-
other semi-supervised approach, described
in (Koo et al, 2008). The second exten-
sion is to apply the approach to second-
order parsing models, such as those de-
scribed in (Carreras, 2007), using a two-
stage semi-supervised learning approach.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed methods on dependency parsing
experiments using two widely used test
collections: the Penn Treebank for En-
glish, and the Prague Dependency Tree-
bank for Czech. Our best results on
test data in the above datasets achieve
93.79% parent-prediction accuracy for En-
glish, and 88.05% for Czech.
1 Introduction
Recent work has successfully developed depen-
dency parsing models for many languages us-
ing supervised learning algorithms (Buchholz and
Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al, 2007). Semi-supervised
learning methods, which make use of unlabeled
data in addition to labeled examples, have the po-
tential to give improved performance over purely
supervised methods for dependency parsing. It
is often straightforward to obtain large amounts
of unlabeled data, making semi-supervised ap-
proaches appealing; previous work on semi-
supervised methods for dependency parsing in-
cludes (Smith and Eisner, 2007; Koo et al, 2008;
Wang et al, 2008).
In particular, Koo et al (2008) describe a
semi-supervised approach that makes use of clus-
ter features induced from unlabeled data, and gives
state-of-the-art results on the widely used depen-
dency parsing test collections: the Penn Tree-
bank (PTB) for English and the Prague Depen-
dency Treebank (PDT) for Czech. This is a very
simple approach, but provided significant perfor-
mance improvements comparing with the state-
of-the-art supervised dependency parsers such as
(McDonald and Pereira, 2006).
This paper introduces an alternative method for
semi-supervised learning for dependency parsing.
Our approach basically follows a framework pro-
posed in (Suzuki and Isozaki, 2008). We extend it
for dependency parsing, which we will refer to as
a Semi-supervised Structured Conditional Model
(SS-SCM). In this framework, a structured condi-
tional model is constructed by incorporating a se-
ries of generative models, whose parameters are
estimated from unlabeled data. This paper de-
scribes a basic method for learning within this ap-
proach, and in addition describes two extensions.
The first extension is to combine our method with
the cluster-based semi-supervised method of (Koo
et al, 2008). The second extension is to apply the
approach to second-order parsing models, more
specifically the model of (Carreras, 2007), using
a two-stage semi-supervised learning approach.
We conduct experiments on dependency parsing
of English (on Penn Treebank data) and Czech (on
the Prague Dependency Treebank). Our experi-
ments investigate the effectiveness of: 1) the basic
SS-SCM for dependency parsing; 2) a combina-
tion of the SS-SCM with Koo et al (2008)?s semi-
supervised approach (even in the case we used the
same unlabeled data for both methods); 3) the two-
stage semi-supervised learning approach that in-
551
corporates a second-order parsing model. In ad-
dition, we evaluate the SS-SCM for English de-
pendency parsing with large amounts (up to 3.72
billion tokens) of unlabeled data .
2 Semi-supervised Structured
Conditional Models for Dependency
Parsing
Suzuki et al (2008) describe a semi-supervised
learning method for conditional random fields
(CRFs) (Lafferty et al, 2001). In this paper we
extend this method to the dependency parsing
problem. We will refer to this extended method
as Semi-supervised Structured Conditional Mod-
els (SS-SCMs). The remainder of this section de-
scribes our approach.
2.1 The Basic Model
Throughout this paper we will use x to denote an
input sentence, and y to denote a labeled depen-
dency structure. Given a sentence x with n words,
a labeled dependency structure y is a set of n de-
pendencies of the form (h,m, l), where h is the
index of the head-word in the dependency, m is
the index of the modifier word, and l is the label
of the dependency. We use h = 0 for the root of
the sentence. We assume access to a set of labeled
training examples, {x
i
,y
i
}
N
i=1
, and in addition a
set of unlabeled examples, {x
?
i
}
M
i=1
.
In conditional log-linear models for dependency
parsing (which are closely related to conditional
random fields (Lafferty et al, 2001)), a distribu-
tion over dependency structures for a sentence x
is defined as follows:
p(y|x) =
1
Z(x)
exp{g(x,y)}, (1)
where Z(x) is the partition function, w is a pa-
rameter vector, and
g(x,y) =
?
(h,m,l)?y
w ? f(x, h,m, l)
Here f(x, h,m, l) is a feature vector represent-
ing the dependency (h,m, l) in the context of the
sentence x (see for example (McDonald et al,
2005a)).
In this paper we extend the definition of g(x,y)
to include features that are induced from unlabeled
data. Specifically, we define
g(x,y) =
?
(h,m,l)?y
w ? f(x, h,m, l)
+
?
(h,m,l)?y
k
?
j=1
v
j
q
j
(x, h,m, l). (2)
In this model v
1
, . . . , v
k
are scalar parameters that
may be positive or negative; q
1
. . . q
k
are func-
tions (in fact, generative models), that are trained
on unlabeled data. The v
j
parameters will dictate
the relative strengths of the functions q
1
. . . q
k
, and
will be trained on labeled data.
For convenience, we will use v to refer to the
vector of parameters v
1
. . . v
k
, and q to refer to the
set of generative models q
1
. . . q
k
. The full model
is specified by values for w,v, and q. We will
write p(y|x;w,v,q) to refer to the conditional
distribution under parameter values w,v,q.
We will describe a three-step parameter estima-
tion method that: 1) initializes the q functions
(generative models) to be uniform distributions,
and estimates parameter values w and v from la-
beled data; 2) induces new functions q
1
. . . q
k
from
unlabeled data, based on the distribution defined
by the w,v,q values from step (1); 3) re-estimates
w and v on the labeled examples, keeping the
q
1
. . . q
k
from step (2) fixed. The end result is a
model that combines supervised training with gen-
erative models induced from unlabeled data.
2.2 The Generative Models
We now describe how the generative models
q
1
. . . q
k
are defined, and how they are induced
from unlabeled data. These models make direct
use of the feature-vector definition f(x,y) used in
the original, fully supervised, dependency parser.
The first step is to partition the d fea-
tures in f(x,y) into k separate feature vectors,
r
1
(x,y) . . . r
k
(x,y) (with the result that f is the
concatenation of the k feature vectors r
1
. . . r
k
). In
our experiments on dependency parsing, we parti-
tioned f into up to over 140 separate feature vec-
tors corresponding to different feature types. For
example, one feature vector r
j
might include only
those features corresponding to word bigrams in-
volved in dependencies (i.e., indicator functions
tied to the word bigram (x
m
, x
h
) involved in a de-
pendency (x, h,m, l)).
We then define a generative model that assigns
a probability
q
?
j
(x, h,m, l) =
d
j
?
a=1
?
r
j,a
(x,h,m,l)
j,a
(3)
to the d
j
-dimensional feature vector r
j
(x, h,m, l).
The parameters of this model are ?
j,1
. . . ?
j,d
j
;
552
they form a multinomial distribution, with the con-
straints that ?
j,a
? 0, and
?
a
?
j,a
= 1. This
model can be viewed as a very simple (naive-
Bayes) model that defines a distribution over fea-
ture vectors r
j
? R
d
j
. The next section describes
how the parameters ?
j,a
are trained on unlabeled
data.
Given parameters ?
j,a
, we can simply define the
functions q
1
. . . q
k
to be log probabilities under the
generative model:
q
j
(x, h,m, l) = log q
?
j
(x, h,m, l)
=
d
j
?
a=1
r
j,a
(x, h,m, l) log ?
j,a
.
We modify this definition slightly, be introducing
scaling factors c
j,a
> 0, and defining
q
j
(x, h,m, l) =
d
j
?
a=1
r
j,a
(x, h,m, l) log
?
j,a
c
j,a
(4)
In our experiments, c
j,a
is simply a count of the
number of times the feature indexed by (j, a) ap-
pears in unlabeled data. Thus more frequent fea-
tures have their contribution down-weighted in the
model. We have found this modification to be ben-
eficial.
2.3 Estimating the Parameters of the
Generative Models
We now describe the method for estimating the
parameters ?
j,a
of the generative models. We
assume initial parameters w,v,q, which define
a distribution p(y|x
?
i
;w,v,q) over dependency
structures for each unlabeled example x
?
i
. We will
re-estimate the generative models q, based on un-
labeled examples. The likelihood function on un-
labeled data is defined as
M
?
i=1
?
y
p(y|x
?
i
;w,v,q)
?
(h,m,l)?y
log q
?
j
(x
?
i
, h,m, l),
(5)
where q
?
j
is as defined in Eq. 3. This function re-
sembles the Q function used in the EM algorithm,
where the hidden labels (in our case, dependency
structures), are filled in using the conditional dis-
tribution p(y|x
?
i
;w,v,q).
It is simple to show that the estimates ?
j,a
that
maximize the function in Eq. 5 can be defined as
follows. First, define a vector of expected counts
based on w,v,q as
?
r
j
=
M
?
i=1
?
y
p(y|x
?
i
;w,v,q)
?
(h,m,l)?y
r
j
(x
?
i
, h,m, l).
Note that it is straightforward to calculate these ex-
pected counts using a variant of the inside-outside
algorithm (Baker, 1979) applied to the (Eisner,
1996) dependency-parsing data structures (Paskin,
2001) for projective dependency structures, or the
matrix-tree theorem (Koo et al, 2007; Smith and
Smith, 2007; McDonald and Satta, 2007) for non-
projective dependency structures.
The estimates that maximize Eq. 5 are then
?
j,a
=
r?
j,a
?
d
j
a=1
r?
j,a
.
In a slight modification, we employ the follow-
ing estimates in our model, where ? > 1 is a pa-
rameter of the model:
?
j,a
=
(? ? 1) + r?
j,a
d
j
? (? ? 1) +
?
d
j
a=1
r?
j,a
. (6)
This corresponds to a MAP estimate under a
Dirichlet prior over the ?
j,a
parameters.
2.4 The Complete Parameter-Estimation
Method
This section describes the full parameter estima-
tion method. The input to the algorithm is a set
of labeled examples {x
i
,y
i
}
N
i=1
, a set of unla-
beled examples {x
?
i
}
M
i=1
, a feature-vector defini-
tion f(x,y), and a partition of f into k feature vec-
tors r
1
. . . r
k
which underly the generative mod-
els. The output from the algorithm is a parameter
vector w, a set of generative models q
1
. . . q
k
, and
parameters v
1
. . . v
k
, which define a probabilistic
dependency parsing model through Eqs. 1 and 2.
The learning algorithm proceeds in three steps:
Step 1: Estimation of a Fully Supervised
Model. We choose the initial value q
0
of the
generative models to be the uniform distribution,
i.e., we set ?
j,a
= 1/d
j
for all j, a. We then de-
fine the regularized log-likelihood function for the
labeled examples, with the generative model fixed
at q
0
, to be:
L(w,v;q
0
) =
n
?
i=1
log p(y
i
|x
i
;w,v,q
0
)
?
C
2
(
||w||
2
+ ||v||
2
)
553
This is a conventional regularized log-likelihood
function, as commonly used in CRF models. The
parameter C > 0 dictates the level of regular-
ization in the model. We define the initial pa-
rameters (w
0
,v
0
) = argmax
w,v
L(w,v;q
0
).
These parameters can be found using conventional
methods for estimating the parameters of regu-
larized log-likelihood functions (in our case we
use LBFGS (Liu and Nocedal, 1989)). Note that
the gradient of the log-likelihood function can be
calculated using the inside-outside algorithm ap-
plied to projective dependency parse structures, or
the matrix-tree theorem applied to non-projective
structures.
Step 2: Estimation of the Generative Mod-
els. In this step, expected count vectors
?
r
1
. . .
?
r
k
are first calculated, based on the distribution
p(y|x;w
0
,v
0
,q
0
). Generative model parameters
?
j,a
are calculated through the definition in Eq. 6;
these estimates define updated generative models
q
1
j
for j = 1 . . . k through Eq. 4. We refer to the
new values for the generative models as q
1
.
Step 3: Re-estimation of w and v. In
the final step, w
1
and v
1
are estimated as
argmax
w,v
L(w,v;q
1
) where L(w,v;q
1
) is de-
fined in an analogous way to L(w,v;q
0
). Thus w
and v are re-estimated to optimize log-likelihood
of the labeled examples, with the generative mod-
els q
1
estimated in step 2.
The final output from the algorithm is the set of
parameters (w
1
,v
1
,q
1
). Note that it is possible to
iterate the method?steps 2 and 3 can be repeated
multiple times (Suzuki and Isozaki, 2008)?but
in our experiments we only performed these steps
once.
3 Extensions
3.1 Incorporating Cluster-Based Features
Koo et al (2008) describe a semi-supervised
approach that incorporates cluster-based features,
and that gives competitive results on dependency
parsing benchmarks. The method is a two-stage
approach. First, hierarchical word clusters are de-
rived from unlabeled data using the Brown et al
clustering algorithm (Brown et al, 1992). Sec-
ond, a new feature set is constructed by represent-
ing words by bit-strings of various lengths, corre-
sponding to clusters at different levels of the hier-
archy. These features are combined with conven-
tional features based on words and part-of-speech
tags. The new feature set is then used within a
conventional discriminative, supervised approach,
such as the averaged perceptron algorithm.
The important point is that their approach uses
unlabeled data only for the construction of a new
feature set, and never affects to learning algo-
rithms. It is straightforward to incorporate cluster-
based features within the SS-SCM approach de-
scribed in this paper. We simply use the cluster-
based feature-vector representation f(x,y) intro-
duced by (Koo et al, 2008) as the basis of our ap-
proach.
3.2 Second-order Parsing Models
Previous work (McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Car-
reras, 2007) has shown that second-order parsing
models, which include information from ?sibling?
or ?grandparent? relationships between dependen-
cies, can give significant improvements in accu-
racy over first-order parsing models. In principle
it would be straightforward to extend the SS-SCM
approach that we have described to second-order
parsing models. In practice, however, a bottle-
neck for the method would be the estimation of
the generative models on unlabeled data. This
step requires calculation of marginals on unlabeled
data. Second-order parsing models generally re-
quire more costly inference methods for the cal-
culation of marginals, and this increased cost may
be prohibitive when large quantities of unlabeled
data are employed.
We instead make use of a simple ?two-stage? ap-
proach for extending the SS-SCM approach to the
second-order parsing model of (Carreras, 2007).
In the first stage, we use a first-order parsing
model to estimate generative models q
1
. . . q
k
from
unlabeled data. In the second stage, we incorpo-
rate these generative models as features within a
second-order parsing model. More precisely, in
our approach, we first train a first-order parsing
model by Step 1 and 2, exactly as described in
Section 2.4, to estimate w
0
, v
0
and q
1
. Then,
we substitute Step 3 as a supervised learning such
as MIRA with a second-order parsing model (Mc-
Donald et al, 2005a), which incorporates q
1
as a
real-values features. We refer this two-stage ap-
proach to as two-stage SS-SCM.
In our experiments we use the 1-best MIRA
algorithm (McDonald and Pereira, 2006)
1
as a
1
We used a slightly modified version of 1-best MIRA,
whose difference can be found in the third line in Eq. 7,
namely, including L(y
i
,y).

4 Experiments
We now describe experiments investigating the ef-
fectiveness of the SS-SCM approach for depen-
dency parsing. The experiments test basic, first-
order parsing models, as well as the extensions
to cluster-based features and second-order parsing
models described in the previous section.
4.1 Data Sets
We conducted experiments on both English and
Czech data. We used the Wall Street Journal
sections of the Penn Treebank (PTB) III (Mar-
cus et al, 1994) as a source of labeled data for
English, and the Prague Dependency Treebank
(PDT) 1.0 (Haji?c, 1998) for Czech. To facili-
tate comparisons with previous work, we used ex-
actly the same training, development and test sets

as those described in (McDonald et al, 2005a;
McDonald et al, 2005b; McDonald and Pereira,
2006; Koo et al, 2008). The English dependency-
parsing data sets were constructed using a stan-
dard set of head-selection rules (Yamada and Mat-
sumoto, 2003) to convert the phrase structure syn-
tax of the Treebank to dependency tree repre-
sentations. We split the data into three parts:
sections 02-21 for training, section 22 for de-
velopment and section 23 for test. The Czech
data sets were obtained from the predefined train-
ing/development/test partition in the PDT. The un-
labeled data for English was derived from the
Brown Laboratory for Linguistic Information Pro-
cessing (BLLIP) Corpus (LDC2000T43)
2
, giving
a total of 1,796,379 sentences and 43,380,315
tokens. The raw text section of the PDT was
used for Czech, giving 2,349,224 sentences and
39,336,570 tokens. These data sets are identical
to the unlabeled data used in (Koo et al, 2008),
and are disjoint from the training, development
and test sets. The datasets used in our experiments
are summarized in Table 1.
In addition, we will describe experiments that
make use of much larger amounts of unlabeled
data. Unfortunately, we have no data available
other than PDT for Czech, this is done only for
English dependency parsing. Table 2 shows the
detail of the larger unlabeled data set used in our
experiments, where we eliminated sentences that
have more than 128 tokens for computational rea-
sons. Note that the total size of the unlabeled data
reaches 3.72G (billion) tokens, which is approxi-

We ensured that the sentences used in the PTB were
excluded from the unlabeled data, since sentences used in
BLLIP corpus are a super-set of the PTB.

mately 4,000 times larger than the size of labeled
training data.
4.2 Features
4.2.1 Baseline Features
In general we will assume that the input sentences
include both words and part-of-speech (POS) tags.
Our baseline features (?baseline?) are very simi-
lar to those described in (McDonald et al, 2005a;
Koo et al, 2008): these features track word and
POS bigrams, contextual features surrounding de-
pendencies, distance features, and so on. En-
glish POS tags were assigned by MXPOST (Rat-
naparkhi, 1996), which was trained on the train-
ing data described in Section 4.1. Czech POS tags
were obtained by the following two steps: First,
we used ?feature-based tagger? included with the
PDT
3
, and then, we used the method described in
(Collins et al, 1999) to convert the assigned rich
POS tags into simplified POS tags.
4.2.2 Cluster-based Features
In a second set of experiments, we make use of the
feature set used in the semi-supervised approach
of (Koo et al, 2008). We will refer to this as the
?cluster-based feature set? (CL). The BLLIP (43M
tokens) and PDT (39M tokens) unlabeled data sets
shown in Table 1 were used to construct the hierar-
chical clusterings used within the approach. Note
that when this feature set is used within the SS-
SCM approach, the same set of unlabeled data is
used to both induce the clusters, and to estimate
the generative models within the SS-SCM model.
4.2.3 Constructing the Generative Models
As described in section 2.2, the generative mod-
els in the SS-SCM approach are defined through
a partition of the original feature vector f(x,y)
into k feature vectors r

(x,y). We
follow a similar approach to that of (Suzuki and
Isozaki, 2008) in partitioning f(x,y), where the
k different feature vectors correspond to different
feature types or feature templates. Note that, in
general, we are not necessary to do as above, this
is one systematic way of a feature design for this
approach.

beled dependency parsing. We ignore the parent-
predictions of punctuation tokens for English,
while we retain all the punctuation tokens for
Czech. These settings match the evaluation setting
in previous work such as (McDonald et al, 2005a;
Koo et al, 2008).
We used the method proposed by (Carreras,
2007) for our second-order parsing model. Since
this method only considers projective dependency
structures, we ?projectivized? the PDT training
data in the same way as (Koo et al, 2008). We
used a non-projective model, trained using an ap-
plication of the matrix-tree theorem (Koo et al,
2007; Smith and Smith, 2007; McDonald and
Satta, 2007) for the first-order Czech models, and
projective parsers for all other models.
As shown in Section 2, SS-SCMs with 1st-order
parsing models have two tunable parameters, C
and ?, corresponding to the regularization con-
stant, and the Dirichlet prior for the generative
models. We selected a fixed value ? = 2, which
was found to work well in preliminary experi-
ments.
4
The value of C was chosen to optimize
performance on development data. Note that C
for supervised SCMs were also tuned on develop-
ment data. For the two-stage SS-SCM for incor-
porating second-order parsing model, we have ad-
ditional one tunable parameter B shown in Eq. 8.
This was also chosen by the value that provided
the best performance on development data.
In addition to providing results for models
trained on the full training sets, we also performed
experiments with smaller labeled training sets.
These training sets were either created through
random sampling or by using a predefined subset
of document IDs from the labeled training data.
5 Results and Discussion
Table 3 gives results for the SS-SCM method un-
der various configurations: for first and second-
order parsing models, with and without the clus-
ter features of (Koo et al, 2008), and for varying
amounts of labeled data. The remainder of this
section discusses these results in more detail.
5.1 Effects of the Quantity of Labeled Data
We can see from the results in Table 3 that our
semi-supervised approach consistently gives gains

An intuitive meaning of ? = 2 is that this adds one
pseudo expected count to every feature when estimating new
parameter values.

in performance under various sizes of labeled data.
Note that the baseline methods that we have used
in these experiments are strong baselines. It is
clear that the gains from our method are larger for
smaller labeled data sizes, a tendency that was also
observed in (Koo et al, 2008).
5.2 Impact of Combining SS-SCM with
Cluster Features
One important observation from the results in Ta-
ble 3 is that SS-SCMs can successfully improve
the performance over a baseline method that uses
the cluster-based feature set (CL). This is in spite
of the fact that the generative models within the
SS-SCM approach were trained on the same un-
labeled data used to induce the cluster-based fea-
tures.
5.3 Impact of the Two-stage Approach
Table 3 also shows the effectiveness of the two-
stage approach (described in Section 3.2) that inte-
grates the SS-SCM method within a second-order
parser. This suggests that the SS-SCM method
can be effective in providing features (generative
models) used within a separate learning algorithm,
providing that this algorithm can make use of real-
valued features.

5.4 Impact of the Amount of Unlabeled Data
Figure 1 shows the dependency parsing accuracy
on English as a function of the amount of unla-
beled data used within the SS-SCM approach. (As
described in Section 4.1, we have no unlabeled
data other than PDT for Czech, hence this section
only considers English dependency parsing.) We
can see that performance does improve as more
unlabeled data is added; this trend is seen both
with and without cluster-based features. In addi-
tion, Table 4 shows the performance of our pro-
posed method using 3.72 billion tokens of unla-

beled data. Note, however, that the gain in perfor-
mance as unlabeled data is added is not as sharp
as might be hoped, with a relatively modest dif-
ference in performance for 43.4 million tokens vs.
3.72 billion tokens of unlabeled data.
5.5 Computational Efficiency
The main computational challenge in our ap-
proach is the estimation of the generative mod-
els q = ?q
1
. . . q
k
? from unlabeled data, partic-
ularly when the amount of unlabeled data used
is large. In our implementation, on the 43M to-
ken BLLIP corpus, using baseline features, it takes
about 5 hours to compute the expected counts re-
quired to estimate the parameters of the generative
models on a single 2.93GHz Xeon processor. It
takes roughly 18 days of computation to estimate
the generative models from the larger (3.72 billion
word) corpus. Fortunately it is simple to paral-
lelize this step; our method takes a few hours on
the larger data set when parallelized across around
300 separate processes.
Note that once the generative models have been
estimated, decoding with the model, or train-
ing the model on labeled data, is relatively in-
expensive, essentially taking the same amount of
computation as standard dependency-parsing ap-
proaches.
5.6 Results on Test Data
Finally, Table 5 displays the final results on test
data. There results are obtained using the best
setting in terms of the development data perfor-
mance. Note that the English dependency pars-
ing results shown in the table were achieved us-
ing 3.72 billion tokens of unlabeled data. The im-
provements on test data are similar to those ob-
served on the development data. To determine
statistical significance, we tested the difference of
parent-prediction error-rates at the sentence level
using a paired Wilcoxon signed rank test. All eight
comparisons shown in Table 5 are significant with

6 Comparison with Previous Methods
Table 6 shows the performance of a number of
state-of-the-art approaches on the English and
Czech data sets. For both languages our ap-
proach gives the best reported figures on these
datasets. Our results yield relative error reduc-
tions of roughly 27% (English) and 20% (Czech)
over McDonald and Pereira (2006)?s second-order
supervised dependency parsers, and roughly 9%
(English) and 7% (Czech) over the previous best
results provided by Koo et. al. (2008)?s second-
order semi-supervised dependency parsers.
Note that there are some similarities between
our two-stage semi-supervised learning approach
and the semi-supervised learning method intro-
duced by (Blitzer et al, 2006), which is an exten-
sion of the method described by (Ando and Zhang,
558
2005). In particular, both methods use a two-stage
approach; They first train generative models or
auxiliary problems from unlabeled data, and then,
they incorporate these trained models into a super-
vised learning algorithm as real valued features.
Moreover, both methods make direct use of exist-
ing feature-vector definitions f(x,y) in inducing
representations from unlabeled data.
7 Conclusion
This paper has described an extension of the
semi-supervised learning approach of (Suzuki and
Isozaki, 2008) to the dependency parsing problem.
In addition, we have described extensions that in-
corporate the cluster-based features of Koo et al
(2008), and that allow the use of second-order
parsing models. We have described experiments
that show that the approach gives significant im-
provements over state-of-the-art methods for de-
pendency parsing; performance improves when
the amount of unlabeled data is increased from
43.8 million tokens to 3.72 billion tokens. The ap-
proach should be relatively easily applied to lan-
guages other than English or Czech.
We stress that the SS-SCM approach requires
relatively little hand-engineering: it makes di-
rect use of the existing feature-vector representa-
tion f(x,y) used in a discriminative model, and
does not require the design of new features. The
main choice in the approach is the partitioning
of f(x,y) into components r
1
(x,y) . . . r
k
(x,y),
which in our experience is straightforward.
