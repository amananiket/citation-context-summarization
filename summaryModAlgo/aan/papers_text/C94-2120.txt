ABSTRACT 
Why should computers interpret language incremen- 
tally? In recent years psycholinguistic evidence for in- 
cremental interpretation has become more and more 
compelling, suggesting that humans perlTorm semantic 
interpretation before constituent boundaries, possibly 
word by word. However, possible computational p- 
plications have received less attention. In this paper 
we consider various potential applications, in parti- 
cular graphical interaction and dialogue. We then re- 
view the theoretical and computational tools available 
for mapping from fragments of sentences to flflly sco- 
ped semantic representations. Finally, we tease apart 
the relationship between dynamic semantics and in- 
creinental interpretation. 
APPL ICAT IONS 
Following the work of, for example, Marslen-Wilson 
(1973), .lust and Carpenter (1980) and Altma.nn al\]d 
Steedrnan (1988), it has heroine widely accepted that 
semantic i11terpretation i  hnman sentence processing 
can occur beibre sentence boundaries and even before 
clausal boundaries. It is less widely accepted that 
there is a need for incremental interpretation i com- 
putational applications. 
In the \[970s and early 1980s several compntational 
implementations motivated the use of' incremental in-. 
terpretation as a way of dealing with structural and 
lexical ambiguity (a survey is given in Haddock 1989). 
A sentence snch as the following has 4862 different 
syntactic parses due solely to attachment ambiguity 
(Stabler 1991). 
1) I put the bouquet of flowers that you gave me for 
Mothers' Day in the vase that you gave me for my 
birthday on the chest of drawers that you gave me 
lbr Armistice Day. 
Although some of the parses can be ruled out using 
structural preferences during parsing (such as \[,ate 
C'losure or Minimal Attachment (Frazier 1979)), ex 
traction of the correct set of plausible readings requi- 
res use of real world knowledge. Incremental inter- 
pretation allows on-line semantic tiltering, i.e. parses 
of initial fragments which have an implausible or an- 
olnalous interpretation are rqiected, thereby preven-

Ling ambiguities from multiplying as the parse pro- 
ceeds. 
However, onqine semantic filtering for sentence pro- 
cessing does have drawbacks. Firstly, for sentence 
processing using a serial architecture (rather than one 
in which syntactic and semantic processing is perfor- 
lned in parallel), the savings in computation obtained 
from on-line filtering have to be balanced against the 
additional costs of performing selnan~ic computations 
for parses of fl:agments which would eventually be ru- 
led out anyway from purely syntactic onsiderations. 
Moreow~r, there are now relatively sophisticated ways 
of packing ambiguities during parsing (e.g. by the nse 
of graph-structured stacks and packed parse forests 
(2blnita 1985)). Secondly, the task of judging plausi- 
bility or anomaly according to context and real world 
knowledge is a difficult problem, except in some very 
lilnited domains. It, contrast, statistical techniqnes 
using lexeme co-occurrence provide a relatively sim- 
ple mechanism which can imitate semantic filtering 
in many cases. 1,br example, instead of judging bank 
as a lhmncial institution as more plansible than bank 
as a riverbank in the noun phrase the rich bank, we 
can cornpare the number of co-occurrences of the le- 
xemcs r ich and bank1 (= riverbank) versus r ich and 
bank2 (= financial institution) in a semantically ana- 
lysed corpus. Cases where statistical techniques eem 
less appropriate arc where plausibility is affected by 
local context. For example, consider the ambiguous 
sentence, The decorators painted a wall with cracks in 
tim two contexts 517~c room was supposed to look" run- 
down vs. The clients couhln't afford wallpaper. Such 
cases involve reasoning with an interpretation in its 
immediate context, as opposed to purely .judging the 
likelihood of a particular linguistic expression in a gi- 
ven application domain (see e.g. Cooper 1993 for dis- 
cussion). 
Although the usefulness of on-line semantic filtering 
during the processing of complete sentences is deba- 
table, filtering has a more plausible role to play in in- 
teractive, real-time nvironments, uch as interactive 
spell checkers (see e.g. Wirdn (1990) I'or arguments for 
incremental parsing in such environnlents). IIere the 
choice is between whether or not to have semantic ill- 
tering at all, rather than whether to do it on-line, or 
at the end of the sentence. 
q'he concentration in early literature on using in- 
cremental interpretation for semantic filtering has 
perha.ps distracted f'roln SOlne other applications 
which provide less controversial pplications. We will

(of some sort) for fragments of sentences, and be able 
to extract semantic representations from these. 
One possibility, which has been explored mainly 
within the Categorial Grammar tradition (e.g. Steed- 
man 1.988) is to provide a grammar which can treat 
most if not all initial fragments as constituents. 'Phey 
then have full syntax trees from which the semantics 
can be calculated. 
However, an alternative possibility is to directly 
link the partial syntax trees which can be %rmed fol: 
nOl>COnstituents with flmctional semantic representa- 
tions. For example, a fragment missing a noun phrase 
such as John likes can be associated with a seman- 
I, ies which is a function from entities to truth values.

la fact there are infinitely many cliff>rent rees possi- 
ble. The completed sente.nce may have an arbitrarily 
large number of intermediate nodes between the lower 
s node and the lower hi). For exarnple, John  could 
be embedded within a gerund e.g. Mary thil&s John 
leaving here was a mistake, and this in turn could be 
enfl)e(lded e.g. Mary thinks John leaving here being 
a mistake is surprising. J ohn  could also be embed- 
ded within a sentence which has a sentence modifier 
requiring its own s node e.g. Mary thinks John will 
go home probably 5, and this can be flu'ther embedded 
4'Phe downarrow notat ion for miss ing const i tuents  is adop- 
ted from Synchronous Tree Adjo in ing (}rammm" (Shleber & 
Schabes 1990). 
5'\['he t reatment  of p robab ly  as a modif ier  of a sentence 
is perhaps controversial .  I lowever,  t reatment  of it: as a verb 
phrase modi l ier  wauld merely shift the potenl, ia\] left recurs|on 
~o Ihe verb phrase node. 
e.g. Mary thinks John will go home Frobablg because 
he is tired. 
The problem of there being an arbitrary mmg)er of 
different partial trees for a particular fragment is re- 
fleeted in most current approaches to incrementM in- 
terpretation being either incomplete, or not flflly word 
by word. For example, incomplete parsers have been 
proposed by Stabler (11991) and Moortga.t (1988). Sta- 
bler's system is a simple top-down parser which does 
not deal with left recursive grammars. Moortgat's 
M-Syste ln  is based on the Lambek (~ah:ulus: the pro- 
blem of an infinite lmmber of possible tree ka.gments 
is replaced by a corresponding problem of initiM fl:ag- 
ments having an infinite number of possible types. A 
colnplete incremental parser, which is not fully word 
by word, was proposed by Pul lnan (1986). This is ba.~ 
sed on arc-eager left-corner parsing (see e.g. l{esnik 
To elmbIe complete, fully word by word parsing re 
quires a way of encoding an intinite nmnber of partiM 
l, rees. There are several possibilities. 'Fhe first is to 
use a language describing trees where we can express 
the fact that ,\]ohn is donfinatcd by the suode,  but 
do not have to speciiy what it. is i lmnediately domina- 
ted by (e.g. D-Theory, Marcus et ah 198a). Semantic 
representations could be tbrmed word by word by ex- 
tracting 'default' syntax trees (by strengthening do- 
minance links into immediated ominance links whe- 
rever possible). 
A second possibility is to factor out recursive struc- 
tures from a grammar. Thompson et al (1991) show 
how this can be done for a phrase structure gram- 
mar (creating an equivalent 'Pree Adjoining ( ; rammar 
(,Ioshi I987)). The parser for the resulting grammar 
allows linear parsing tbr an (infinitely) parallel sy- 
stem, with Cite absorption of each word performed 
in constant time. At each choice point, there are 
only a finite number of possible new partial TAG trees 
(the TAG trees represents the possibly inlinite nmn- 
bet of trees which can be forlned using adjunct|on). 
It should agMn be possible to extract 'default'  seman- 
tic values, by taking the semantics from the TA(I tree 
(i.e. by assuming that there are to be ,to adj unctions). 
A somewhat similar system has recently been propo- 
sed by Shieber and Johnson (191t3). 
The third possibility is suggested by considering 
the semantic representations which are appropria.te 
during a word by word parse. Although there are 
any number of dill'trent partial trees for the fragment 
Mary thinks John, the semautics of the fragment can 
be represented using just two lambda expressions6: 
AP. thinks(mary,I)(john)) 
AP. AQ. Q(thinks(mary, P(john))) 
Consider the tlrst. The lambda abstraction (over a

f imctional item of type e--}l;) can 1)e thought of as 
~t way of encoding mt intinite set of pnrt ial  sema.ntie 
(tree) structures. For cxmnple, the eventual semant ic  
structure may embed john  at ~my depth e.g. 
t hinks(nm.ry,sleeps (j oh n)) 
thinks(nmry,possibly(sh' .eps(johu)))  
etc. 
The second exl)re.ssion (~ fimctiona\] i tem over type 
e-+t; and t -+t ) ,  allows for eventual structures where 
the main  senten<:e is embedde.d e.g. 
l>ossibly(l, h inks(nmry,s leeps( john)))  
This third possibil ity is therefor<; to l>rovide a, syntac- 
tic correlate of lambda expressions. In l)rm:tice, ho--

This intuitive evidence can be backed up by consi- 
dering garden path effects with quantifier scope tun- 
biguities (called jungle paths by Barwise 1987). The 
original examples, such ~s the fbllowing,

established and are overturned. 'Po show that pre- 
ferences are sometimes established before the end of' 
a sentence, and before a potential sentence nd, we 
need to show ga.rden path effects in examples uch as 
the following: 
10) Mary pttt the inIbrmation that statistics show

Most psycholinguistic experimentation has been con- 
cerned with which scope preferences are made, rather 
than the point at which the preferences are establis- 
hcd (see e.g. Kurtzman and MacDonald, 1993). Given 
tile illtuitive evidence, our hypothesis is that scope 
preferences can sometimes be established early, befbre 
the end ofa  sentence. This leaves open the possibility 
that in other cases, where the scoping inIbrmation is 
not particularly of interest o the hearer, preferences 
are determined late, if at all. 
3.1 Inc re lnenta l  Quant i f ie r  Scoping: hnp le -  
lnent, at ion 
Dealing with quantifiers incrementally is a rather si- 
mila.r problem to dealing with h'aglnents of trees incre- 
mentally, a,st  as it is in-,possible to predict the level 
of embedding of ~r noun phrase such as John from tile 
fragment Mary thinL's John, it is also impossible to 
predict the scope of a quantifier in a fragment with 
respect ~o the arbitrarily large number of quantiliers 
which might appear later in the sentence. Again the 
problem can be avoided by a tbrm of pacldng. A par- 
ticularly simple way of doing this is to use unseoped 
logical forms where qmmtifiers are left in situ (silni- 
lar to the representations u ed by Hobbs and Shieber 
(1987), or to Quasi Logical Form (Alshawi 1990)). For 
example, the fl'agment Every man gives a boot" can be 
given the tbllowing representation: 
I1) kz.gives(< V,x,nlan(x)>,< ~,y,book(y)>,z) 
Each qnantitied term consists of' a quantitier, a va.ria- 
ble and a restrictor, but, no body. To convert lambda 
expressions to unscoped propositions, we replace an 
occurrence of each argument with an empty existen- 
tia.l quantitier term. In this case we obtain: 
12) gives(< V,X,ITIall(X)>,< 3,y,book(y)>,< -~,z,'l'>) 
Scoped propositions can then be obtained by using an 
outside-in quantifier scoping algorithm (Lewin, 1990), 
or an inside-out algorithm with a free w~riable con- 
straint (IIobbs and Shieber, 1987). The propositions 
fbrlncd can then be judged for plausibility. 
To imitate jungle path phenomena, these pla.usi o 
bility judgements need to feed back into the scoping 
procedure for the next fragment. For example, if' every 
man is taken to be scoped outside a book after proces- 
sing the fragment l?vcry man ga~c. a book, \[;hen this 
preference should be preserved when deterlnining the 
scope for the full sentence l?very uza~t gave a book lo 
a child. Thus instead of doing ~dl quantitier scoping 
at the end of the sentence, each new quantilier is sco- 
ped relative to the existing quantifiers (and operators 
such as negation, intensional verbs etc.). A prelimi- 
nary irnplemenl, ation achieves this by annotating the 
semantic representations with node nantes, a.nd re- 
cording which quantifiers are 'discharged' at. which 
nodes, and in which order. 
DYNAMIC SEMANTICS  
l)ynamic semantics adopts the view that "the mea-- 
ning of a sentence does not lie ill its truth conditi- 
ons, but rather in the way ill which it changes (tile 
representation of) the in\[brmation of the intcrl)reter" 
(Groencndijk and Stokho\[', \]991). At first glance such 
a. view seems ideally suited t.o incremental interpreta- 
tion. Indeed, Groenendijk and Stokhof claim that the 
compositional nature o\[' l)ynamic Predicate Logic en- 
ables one to "interpret a text ir~ an on-line ntauner, 
i.e., incrementally, processing a.nd interpreting each 
basic unit as it comes along, in the context created 
by the  interpretation of the t.ext so fa.r'. 
Putting these two quotes together is, however, mis- 
leading, since it suggests a more direct mapping bet- 
ween incremental sem~mtics and dyna.mh: semantics 
than is actually possible. In an incremental semantics, 
we would expect the informtttiou state, of an interpre- 
ter to be updated word by word. In contrast, in dyna- 
mic semantics, the ol:der in which states are updated 
is determined by semantic st;ructure, not by left-to- 
right order (see e.g. I,ewiu, 1992 \[br discussion). For 
example, in 1)ynanfic Predicate Logic ((~roenendijk ,~ 
Stokhof, 1991), states are threaded from the antece- 
dent of a conditional into I, he conseque~d~, and from 
a restrictor of' a quantitier into I;he body. Thus, in 
interpreting, 
13) John will buy it right away, if a car impresses him 
the input state for evMuation of .John will bug it right 
away is the output state from the a.ntecedent a ear 
hnp,vsses hhn. in this ease the threading through 
semantic structure is in the opposite order to the order 
in which the two clauses appear in the sentence. 
Some intuitive justification for the direction of 
threading in dynamic semantics is provided by cou- 
sidering appropriate orders for evaluation of proposi- 
tions against a database: the natural order in which

CONCLUSIONS 
The  paper described some potent ial  appl icat ions 0\]7 in- 
cremental  interpretat ion.  It then described the series 
of steps required in mapp ing  fi'Oln initial f ragments  
of sentences to proposi t ions which can I)e judged for 
plausibil ity. I,'inally, it argued that  the apparent ly  
close re lat ionship between the states used in incre- 
menta l  semant ics  and dynamic  semant ics  fails to hold 
I)elt)w the sentence level, and briefly presented a more 
indirect way of  us ing dynamic  semant ics  in increinen- 
tal interpretat ion.
