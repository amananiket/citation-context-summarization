Abstract
Many probabilistic models for natural language
are now written in terms of hierarchical tree
structure. Tree-based modeling still lacks many
of the standard tools taken for granted in (finite-
state) string-based modeling. The theory of tree
transducer automata provides a possible frame-
work to draw on, as it has been worked out in an
extensive literature. We motivate the use of tree
transducers for natural language and address
the training problem for probabilistic tree-to-
tree and tree-to-string transducers.
1 Introduction
Much of natural language work over the past decade has
employed probabilistic finite-state transducers (FSTs)
operating on strings. This has occurred somewhat under
the influence of speech recognition, where transducing
acoustic sequences to word sequences is neatly captured
by left-to-right stateful substitution. Many conceptual
tools exist, such as Viterbi decoding (Viterbi, 1967) and
forward-backward training (Baum and Eagon, 1967), as
well as generic software toolkits. Moreover, a surprising
variety of problems are attackable with FSTs, from part-
of-speech tagging to letter-to-sound conversion to name
transliteration.
However, language problems like machine transla-
tion break this mold, because they involve massive re-
ordering of symbols, and because the transformation pro-
cesses seem sensitive to hierarchical tree structure. Re-
cently, specific probabilistic tree-based models have been
proposed not only for machine translation (Wu, 1997;
Alshawi, Bangalore, and Douglas, 2000; Yamada and
Knight, 2001; Gildea, 2003; Eisner, 2003), but also for

summarization (Knight and Marcu, 2002), paraphras-
ing (Pang, Knight, and Marcu, 2003), natural language
generation (Langkilde and Knight, 1998; Bangalore and
Rambow, 2000; Corston-Oliver et al, 2002), and lan-
guage modeling (Baker, 1979; Lari and Young, 1990;
Collins, 1997; Chelba and Jelinek, 2000; Charniak, 2001;
Klein and Manning, 2003). It is useful to understand
generic algorithms that may support all these tasks and
more.
(Rounds, 1970) and (Thatcher, 1970) independently
introduced tree transducers as a generalization of FSTs.
Rounds was motivated by natural language. The Rounds
tree transducer is very similar to a left-to-right FST, ex-
cept that it works top-down, pursuing subtrees in paral-
lel, with each subtree transformed depending only on its
own passed-down state. This class of transducer is often
nowadays called R, for ?Root-to-frontier? (G?cseg and
Steinby, 1984).
Rounds uses a mathematics-oriented example of an R
transducer, which we summarize in Figure 1. At each
point in the top-down traversal, the transducer chooses
a production to apply, based only on the current state
and the current root symbol. The traversal continues
until there are no more state-annotated nodes. Non-
deterministic transducers may have several productions
with the same left-hand side, and therefore some free
choices to make during transduction.
An R transducer compactly represents a potentially-
infinite set of input/output tree pairs: exactly those pairs
(T1, T2) for which some sequence of productions applied
to T1 (starting in the initial state) results in T2. This is
similar to an FST, which compactly represents a set of
input/output string pairs, and in fact, R is a generalization
of FST. If we think of strings written down vertically, as
degenerate trees, we can convert any FST into an R trans-
ducer by automatically replacing FST transitions with R
productions.
R does have some extra power beyond path following

derivative of its input.
and state-based record keeping. It can copy whole sub-
trees, and transform those subtrees differently. It can also
delete subtrees without inspecting them (imagine by anal-
ogy an FST that quits and accepts right in the middle of
an input string). Variants of R that disallow copying and
deleting are called RL (for linear) and RN (for nondelet-
ing), respectively.
One advantage of working with tree transducers is the
large and useful body of literature about these automata;
two excellent surveys are (G?cseg and Steinby, 1984) and
(Comon et al, 1997). For example, R is not closed under
composition (Rounds, 1970), and neither are RL or F (the
?frontier-to-root? cousin of R), but the non-copying FL
is closed under composition. Many of these composition
results are first found in (Engelfriet, 1975).
R has surprising ability to change the structure of an
input tree. For example, it may not be initially obvious
how an R transducer can transform the English structure
S(PRO, VP(V, NP)) into the Arabic equivalent S(V, PRO,
NP), as it is difficult to move the subject PRO into posi-
tion between the verb V and the direct object NP. First, R
productions have no lookahead capability?the left-hand-
side of the S production consists only of q S(x0, x1), al-
though we want our English-to-Arabic transformation to
apply only when it faces the entire structure q S(PRO,
VP(V, NP)). However, we can simulate lookahead using
states, as in these productions:
- q S(x0, x1) ? S(qpro x0, qvp.v.np x1)
- qpro PRO ? PRO
- qvp.v.np VP(x0, x1) ? VP(qv x0, qnp x1)
By omitting rules like qpro NP? ..., we ensure that the
entire production sequence will dead-end unless the first
child of the input tree is in fact PRO. So finite lookahead
is not a problem. The next problem is how to get the PRO
to appear in between the V and NP, as in Arabic. This can
be carried out using copying. We make two copies of the
English VP, and assign them different states:
- q S(x0,x1) ? S(qleft.vp.v x1, qpro x0,
qright.vp.np x1)
- qpro PRO ? PRO
- qleft.vp.v VP(x0, x1) ? qv x0
- qright.vp.np VP(x0, x1) ? qnp x1
While general properties of R are understood, there
are many algorithmic questions. In this paper, we take
on the problem of training probabilistic R transducers.
For many language problems (machine translation, para-
phrasing, text compression, etc.), it is possible to collect
training data in the form of tree pairs and to distill lin-
guistic knowledge automatically.
Our problem statement is: Given (1) a particular
transducer with productions P, and (2) a finite training set
of sample input/output tree pairs, we want to produce (3)
a probability estimate for each production in P such that
we maximize the probability of the output trees given the
input trees.
As organized in the rest of this paper, we accomplish
this by intersecting the given transducer with each in-
put/output pair in turn. Each such intersection produces a
set of weighted derivations that are packed into a regular
tree grammar (Sections 3-5), which is equivalent to a tree
substitution grammar. The inside and outside probabili-
ties of this packed derivation structure are used to com-
pute expected counts of the productions from the original,
given transducer (Sections 6-7). Section 9 gives a sample
transducer implementing a published machine translation
model; some readers may wish to skip to this section di-
rectly.
2 Trees
T? is the set of (rooted, ordered, labeled, finite) trees over
alphabet ?. An alphabet is just a finite set.
T?(X) are the trees over alphabet ?, indexed by X?
the subset of T??X where only leaves may be labeled by
X . (T?(?) = T?.) Leaves are nodes with no children.
The nodes of a tree t are identified one-to-one with its
paths: pathst ? paths ? N? ?
??
i=0 Ni (A0 ? {()}).
The path to the root is the empty sequence (), and p1
extended by p2 is p1 ? p2, where ? is concatenation.
For p ? pathst, rankt(p) is the number of chil-
dren, or rank, of the node at p in t, and labelt(p) ?
? ? X is its label. The ranked label of a node is the
pair labelandrankt(p) ? (labelt(p), rankt(p)). For
1 ? i ? rankt(p), the ith child of the node at p is
located at path p ? (i). The subtree at path p of t is
t ? p, defined by pathst?p ? {q | p ? q ? pathst} and
labelandrankt?p(q) ? labelandrankt(p ? q).
The paths to X in t are pathst(X) ? {p ?
pathst | labelt(p) ? X}. A frontier is a set of paths
f that are pairwise prefix-independent:
?p1, p2 ? f, p ? paths : p1 = p2 ? p =? p1 = p2
A frontier of t is a frontier f ? pathst.
For t, s ? T?(X), p ? pathst, t[p? s] is the substitu-
tion of s for p in t, where the subtree at path p is replaced
by s. For a frontier f of t, the mass substitution of X
for the frontier f in t is written t[p ? X, ?p ? f ] and
is equivalent to substituting the X(p) for the p serially in
any order.
Trees may be written as strings over ? ? {(, )}
in the usual way. For example, the tree t =
S(NP,VP(V,NP)) has labelandrankt((2)) = (VP, 2)
and labelandrankt((2, 1)) = (V, 0). For t ? T?, ? ? ?,
?(t) is the tree whose root has label ? and whose single
child is t.
The yield of X in t is yieldt(X), the string formed by
reading out the leaves labeled with X in left-to-right or-
der. The usual case (the yield of t) is yieldt ? yieldt(?).

3 Regular Tree Grammars
In this section, we describe the regular tree grammar, a
common way of compactly representing a potentially in-
finite set of trees (similar to the role played by the finite-
state acceptor FSA for strings). We describe the version
(equivalent to TSG (Schabes, 1990)) where the generated
trees are given weights, as are strings in a WFSA.
A weighted regular tree grammar (wRTG) G is a
quadruple (?, N, S, P ), where ? is the alphabet, N is
the finite set of nonterminals, S ? N is the start (or ini-
tial) nonterminal, and P ? N?T?(N)?R+ is the finite
set of weighted productions (R+ ? {r ? R | r > 0}). A
production (lhs, rhs, w) is written lhs?w rhs. Produc-
tions whose rhs contains no nonterminals (rhs ? T?)
are called terminal productions, and rules of the form
A ?w B, for A,B ? N are called ?-productions, or
epsilon productions, and can be used in lieu of multiple
initial nonterminals.
Figure 2 shows a sample wRTG. This grammar ac-
cepts an infinite number of trees. The tree S(NP(DT(the),
N(sons)), VP(V(run))) comes out with probability 0.3.
We define the binary relation?G (single-step derives
in G) on T?(N)?(paths?P )?, pairs of trees and deriva-
tion histories, which are logs of (location, production
used):
?G?
{
((a, h), (b, h ? (p, (l, r, w)))
?
?
(l, r, w) ? P ? p ? pathsa({l}) ? b = a[p? r]
}
where (a, h)?G (b, h ? (p, (l, r, w))) iff tree b may be
derived from tree a by using the rule l ?w r to replace
the nonterminal leaf l at path p with r. For a derivation
history h = ((p1, (l1, r1, w1)), . . . , (pn, (l1, r1, w1))),
the weight of h is w(h) ??ni=1 wi, and call h leftmost if
L(h) ? ?1 ? i < n : pi+1 ?lex pi.1
1() <lex (a), (a1) <lex (a2) iff a1 < a2, (a1) ? b1 <lex
(a2) ? b2 iff a1 < a2 ? (a1 = a2 ? b1 <lex b2)
The reflexive, transitive closure of?G is written??G
(derives in G), and the restriction of ??G to leftmost
derivation histories is?L?G (leftmost derives in G).
The weight of a becoming b in G is wG(a, b) ?
?
h:(a,())?L?G (b,h)
w(h), the sum of weights of all unique
(leftmost) derivations transforming a to b, and the weight
of t in G is WG(t) = wG(S, t). The weighted regu-
lar tree language produced by G is LG ? {(t, w) ?
T? ? R+ |WG(t) = w}.
For every weighted context-free grammar, there is an
equivalent wRTG that produces its weighted derivation
trees with yields being the string produced, and the yields
of regular tree grammars are context free string languages
(G?cseg and Steinby, 1984).
What is sometimes called a forest in natural language
generation (Langkilde, 2000; Nederhof and Satta, 2002)
is a finite wRTG without loops, i.e., ?n ? N(n, ()) ??G
(t, h) =? pathst({n}) = ?. Regular tree languages
are strictly contained in tree sets of tree adjoining gram-
mars (Joshi and Schabes, 1997).
4 Extended-LHS Tree Transducers (xR)
Section 1 informally described the root-to-frontier trans-
ducer class R. We saw that R allows, by use of states,
finite lookahead and arbitrary rearrangement of non-
sibling input subtrees removed by a finite distance. How-
ever, it is often easier to write rules that explicitly repre-
sent such lookahead and movement, relieving the burden
on the user to produce the requisite intermediary rules
and states. We define xR, a convenience-oriented gener-
alization of weighted R. Because of its good fit to natu-
ral language problems, xR is already briefly touched on,
though not defined, in (Rounds, 1970).
A weighted extended-lhs root-to-frontier tree trans-
ducer X is a quintuple (?,?, Q,Qi, R) where ? is the
input alphabet, and ? is the output alphabet, Q is a fi-
nite set of states, Qi ? Q is the initial (or start, or root)
state, and R ? Q ? XRPAT? ? T?(Q ? paths) ? R+
is a finite set of weighted transformation rules, written
(q, pattern) ?w rhs, meaning that an input subtree
matching pattern while in state q is transformed into
rhs, with Q? paths leaves replaced by their (recursive)
transformations. The Q?paths leaves of a rhs are called
nonterminals (there may also be terminal leaves la-
beled by the output tree alphabet ?).
XRPAT? is the set of finite tree patterns: predicate
functions f : T? ? {0, 1} that depend only on the la-
bel and rank of a finite number of fixed paths their in-
put. xR is the set of all such transducers. R, the set
of conventional top-down transducers, is a subset of xR
where the rules are restricted to use finite tree patterns
that depend only on the root: RPAT? ? {p?,r(t)} where
p?,r(t) ? (labelt(()) = ? ? rankt(()) = r).
Rules whose rhs are a pure T? with no states/paths
for further expansion are called terminal rules. Rules
of the form (q, pat) ?w (q?, ()) are ?-rules, or epsilon
rules, which substitute state q? for state q without produc-
ing output, and stay at the current input subtree. Multiple
initial states are not needed: we can use a single start
state Qi, and instead of each initial state q with starting
weight w add the rule (Qi,TRUE) ?w (q, ()) (where
TRUE(t) ? 1, ?t).
We define the binary relation?X for xR tranducer X
on T????Q?(paths?R)?, pairs of partially transformed
(working) trees and derivation histories:
?X?
{
((a, h), (b, h ? (i, (q, pat, r, w))))
?
?
(q, pat, r, w) ? R ? i ? pathsa ?
q = labela(i) ? pat(a ? (i ? (1))) = 1 ?
b = a
[
i? r
[
p? q?(a ? (i ? (1) ? i?)),
?p : labelr(p) = (q?, i?)
]]
}
That is, b is derived from a by application of a rule
(q, pat) ?w r to an unprocessed input subtree a ? i
which is in state q, replacing it by output given by r, with
its nonterminals replaced by the instruction to transform
descendant input subtrees at relative path i? in state q?.
The sources of a rule r = (q, l, rhs, w) ? R are the input-
path parts of the rhs nonterminals:
sources(rhs) ?
?
i?
?
? ?p ? pathsrhs(Q? paths),
q? ? Q : labelrhs(p) = (q?, i?)
?
If the sources of a rule refer to input paths that do not
exist in the input, then the rule cannot apply (because
a ? (i ? (1) ? i?) would not exist). In the traditional state-
ment of R, sources(rhs) is always {(1), . . . , (n)}, writ-
ing xi instead of (i), but in xR, we identify mapped input
subtrees by arbitrary (finite) paths.
An input tree is transformed by starting at the root
in the initial state, and recursively applying output-
generating rules to a frontier of (copies of) input subtrees
(each marked with their own state), until (in a complete
derivation, finishing at the leaves with terminal rules) no
states remain.
Let ??X , ?L?X , and wX(a, b) follow from ?X ex-
actly as in Section 3. Then the weight of (i, o) in X
is WX(i, o) ? wX(Qi(i), o). The weighted tree trans-
duction given by X is XX ? {(i, o, w) ? T? ? T? ?
R+|WX(i, o) = w}.
5 Parsing a Tree Transduction
Derivation trees for a transducer X = (?,?, Q,Qi, R)
are trees labeled by rules (R) that dictate the choice of
rules in a complete X-derivation. Figure 3 shows deriva-
tion trees for a particular transducer. In order to generate
Figure 3: Derivation trees for an R tree transducer.
derivation trees for X automatically, we build a modified
transducer X ?. This new transducer produces derivation
trees on its output instead of normal output trees. X ? is
(?, R,Q,Qi, R?), with
R? ? {(q, pattern, rule(yieldrhs(Q? paths)), w) |
rule = (q, pattern, rhs, w) ? R}
That is, the original rhs of rules are flattened into a
tree of depth 1, with the root labeled by the original rule,
and all the non-expanding ?-labeled nodes of the rhs re-
moved, so that the remaining children are the nonterminal
yield in left to right order. Derivation trees deterministi-
cally produce a single weighted output tree.
The derived transducer X ? nicely produces derivation
trees for a given input, but in explaining an observed
(input/output) pair, we must restrict the possibilities fur-
ther. Because the transformations of an input subtree
depend only on that subtree and its state, we can (Al-
gorithm 1) build a compact wRTG that produces ex-
actly the weighted derivation trees corresponding to X-
transductions (I, ()) ??X (O, h) (with weight equal to
wX(h)).
6 Inside-Outside for wRTG
Given a wRTG G = (?, N, S, P ), we can compute
the sums of weights of trees derived using each produc-
tion by adapting the well-known inside-outside algorithm
for weighted context-free (string) grammars (Lari and
Young, 1990).
The inside weights using G are given by ?G : T? ?
(R?R?), giving the sum of weights of all tree-producing
derivatons from trees with nonterminal leaves:
?G(t) ?
?
?
?
?
?
?
?
?
(t,r,w)?P
w ? ?G(r) if t ? N
?
p?pathst(N)
?G(labelt(p)) otherwise
By definition, ?G(S) gives the sum of the weights of
all trees generated by G. For the wRTG generated by
DERIV(X, I,O), this is exactly WX(I,O).
Outside weights ?G for a nonterminal are the sums of
weights of trees generated by the wRTG that have deriva-
tions containing it, but excluding its inside weights (that
is, the weights summed do not include the weights of
rules used to expand an instance of it).

The possible derivations for a given
PRODUCEI,O(q, i, o) are constant and need not be
computed more than once, so the function is memoized.
We have in the worst case to visit all |Q| ? |I| ? |O|
(q, i, o) pairs and have all |R| transducer rules match at
each of them. If enumerating rules matching transducer
input-patterns and output-subtrees has cost L (constant
given a transducer), then DERIV has time complexity
O(L ? |Q| ? |I| ? |O| ? |R|).
Finally, given inside and outside weights, the sum
of weights of trees using a particular production is
?G((n, r, w) ? P ) ? ?G(n) ? w ? ?G(r).
Computing ?G and ?G for nonrecursive wRTG is a
straightforward translation of the above recursive defi-
nitions (using memoization to compute each result only
once) and is O(|G|) in time and space.
7 EM Training
Estimation-Maximization training (Dempster, Laird, and
Rubin, 1977) works on the principle that the corpus like-
lihood can be maximized subject to some normalization
constraint on the parameters by repeatedly (1) estimating
the expectation of decisions taken for all possible ways of
generating the training corpus given the current parame-
ters, accumulating parameter counts, and (2) maximizing
by assigning the counts to the parameters and renormal-
izing. Each iteration is guaranteed to increase the like-
lihood until a local maximum is reached.
Algorithm 2 implements EM xR training, repeatedly
computing inside-outside weights (using fixed transducer
derivation wRTGs for each input/output tree pair) to ef-
ficiently sum each parameter contribution to likelihood
over all derivations. Each EM iteration takes time linear
in the size of the transducer and linear in the size of the
derivation tree grammars for the training examples. The
size of the derivation trees is at worst O(|Q|?|I|?|O|?|R|).
For a corpus of K examples with average input/output
size M , an iteration takes (at worst) O(|Q| ? |R| ?K ?M2)
time?quadratic, like the forward-backward algorithm.
8 Tree-to-String Transducers (xRS)
We now turn to tree-to-string transducers (xRS). In the
automata literature, these were first called generalized
syntax-directed translations (Aho and Ullman, 1971) and
used to specify compilers. Tree-to-string transducers
have also been applied to machine translation (Yamada
and Knight, 2001; Eisner, 2003).
We give an explicit tree-to-string transducer example
in the next section. Formally, a weighted extended-lhs
root-to-frontier tree-to-string transducer X is a quintuple
(?,?, Q,Qi, R) where ? is the input alphabet, and ?
is the output alphabet, Q is a finite set of states, Qi ?
Q is the initial (or start, or root) state, and R ? Q ?
XRPAT?? (?? (Q?paths))??R+ are a finite set of
weighted transformation rules, written (q, pattern) ?w
rhs. A rule says that to transform (with weight w) an
input subtree matching pattern while in state q, replace
it by the string of rhs with its nonterminal (Q ? paths)
letters replaced by their (recursive) transformation.
xRS is the same as xR, except that the rhs are strings
containing some nonterminals instead of trees containing
nonterminal leaves (so the intermediate derivation objects

are strings containing state-marked input subtrees). We
have developed an xRS training procedure similar to the
xR procedure, with extra computational expense to con-
sider how different productions might map to different
spans of the output string. Space limitations prohibit a
detailed description; we refer the reader to a longer ver-
sion of this paper (submitted). We note that this algo-
rithm subsumes normal inside-outside training of PCFG
on strings (Lari and Young, 1990), since we can always
fix the input tree to some constant for all training exam-
ples.
9 Example
It is possible to cast many current probabilistic natural
language models as R-type tree transducers. In this sec-
tion, we implement the translation model of (Yamada
and Knight, 2001). Their generative model provides
a formula for P(Japanese string | English tree), in terms
of individual parameters, and their appendix gives spe-
cial EM re-estimation formulae for maximizing the prod-
uct of these conditional probabilities across the whole
tree/string corpus.
We now build a trainable xRS tree-to-string transducer
that embodies the same P(Japanese string | English tree).
First, we need start productions like these, where q is the
start state:
- q x:S ? q.TOP.S x
- q x:VP ? q.TOP.VP x
These set up states like q.TOP.S, which means ?translate
this tree, whose root is S.? Then every q.parent.child pair
gets its own set of three insert-function-word productions,
e.g.:
- q.TOP.S x ? i x, r x
- q.TOP.S x ? r x, i x
- q.TOP.S x ? r x
- q.NP.NN x ? i x, r x
- q.NP.NN x ? r x, i x
- q.NP.NN x ? r x
State i means ?produce a Japanese function word out of
thin air.? We include an i production for every Japanese
word in the vocabulary, e.g.:
- i x ? de
- i x ? kuruma
- i x ? wa
State r means ?re-order my children and then recurse.?
For internal nodes, we include a production for ev-
ery parent/child-sequence and every permutation thereof,
e.g.:
- r NP(x0:CD, x1:NN) ? q.NP.CD x0, q.NP.NN x1
- r NP(x0:CD, x1:NN) ? q.NP.NN x1, q.NP.CD x0
The rhs sends the child subtrees back to state q for re-
cursive processing. However, for English leaf nodes, we
instead transition to a different state t, so as to prohibit
any subsequent Japanese function word insertion:
- r NN(x0:car) ? t x0
- r CC(x0:and) ? t x0
State t means ?translate this word,? and we have a produc-
tion for every pair of co-occurring English and Japanese
words:
- t car ? kuruma
- t car ? wa
- t car ? *e*
This follows (Yamada and Knight, 2001) in also allowing
English words to disappear, or translate to epsilon.
Every production in the xRS transducer has an associ-
ated weight and corresponds to exactly one of the model
parameters.
There are several benefits to this xRS formulation.
First, it clarifies the model, in the same way that (Knight
and Al-Onaizan, 1998; Kumar and Byrne, 2003) eluci-
date other machine translation models in easily-grasped
FST terms. Second, the model can be trained with
generic, off-the-shelf tools?versus the alternative of
working out model-specific re-estimation formulae and
implementing custom training software. Third, we can
easily extend the model in interesting ways. For exam-
ple, we can add productions for multi-level and lexical
re-ordering:
- r NP(x0:NP, PP(IN(of), x1:NP)) ? q x1, no, q x0
We can add productions for phrasal translations:
- r NP(JJ(big), NN(cars)) ? ooki, kuruma
This can now include crucial non-constituent phrasal
translations:
- r S(NP(PRO(there),VP(VB(are), x0:NP) ? q x0, ga,
arimasu
We can also eliminate many epsilon word-translation
rules in favor of more syntactically-controlled ones, e.g.:
- r NP(DT(the),x0:NN) ? q x0
We can make many such changes without modifying the
training procedure, as long as we stick to tree automata.

Tree substitution grammars or TSG (Schabes, 1990)
are equivalent to regular tree grammars. xR transduc-
ers are similar to (weighted) Synchronous TSG, except
that xR can copy input trees (and transform the copies
differently), but does not model deleted input subtrees.
(Eisner, 2003) discusses training for Synchronous TSG.
Our training algorithm is a generalization of forward-
backward EM training for finite-state (string) transducers,
which is in turn a generalization of the original forward-
backward algorithm for Hidden Markov Models.
