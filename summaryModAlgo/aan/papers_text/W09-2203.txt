Abstract
We address two critical issues involved in ap-
plying semi-supervised learning (SSL) to a
real-world task: parameter tuning and choos-
ing which (if any) SSL algorithm is best suited
for the task at hand. To gain a better un-
derstanding of these issues, we carry out a
medium-scale empirical study comparing su-
pervised learning (SL) to two popular SSL al-
gorithms on eight natural language processing
tasks under three performance metrics. We
simulate how a practitioner would go about
tackling a new problem, including parameter
tuning using cross validation (CV). We show
that, under such realistic conditions, each of
the SSL algorithms can be worse than SL on
some datasets. However, we also show that
CV can select SL/SSL to achieve ?agnostic
SSL,? whose performance is almost always no
worse than SL. While CV is often dismissed as
unreliable for SSL due to the small amount of
labeled data, we show that it is in fact effective
for accuracy even when the labeled dataset
size is as small as 10.
1 Introduction
Imagine you are a real-world practitioner working
on a machine learning problem in natural language
processing. If you have unlabeled data, should you
use semi-supervised learning (SSL)? Which SSL al-
gorithm should you use? How should you set its pa-
rameters? Or could it actually hurt performance, in
which case you might be better off with supervised
learning (SL)?
A large number of SSL algorithms have been de-
veloped in recent years that allow one to improve
performance with unlabeled data, in tasks such
as text classification, sequence labeling, and pars-
ing (Zhu, 2005; Chapelle et al, 2006; Brefeld and
Scheffer, 2006). However, many of them are tested
on ?SSL-friendly? datasets, such as ?two moons,?
USPS, and MNIST. Furthermore, the algorithms?
parameters are often chosen based on test set per-
formance or manually set based on heuristics and
researcher experience. These issues create practical
concerns for deploying SSL in the real world.
We note that (Chapelle et al, 2006)?s benchmark
chapter explores these issues to some extent by com-
paring several SSL methods on several real and ar-
tificial datasets. The authors reach the conclusions
that parameter tuning is difficult with little labeled
data and that no method is universally superior. We
reexamine these issues in the context of NLP tasks
and offer a simple attempt at overcoming these road-
blocks to practical application of SSL.
The contributions of this paper include:
? We present a medium-scale empirical study
comparing SL to two popular SSL algorithms
on eight less-familiar tasks using three per-
formance metrics. Importantly, we tune pa-
rameters realistically based on cross validation
(CV), as a practitioner would do in reality.
? We show that, under such realistic conditions,
each of the SSL algorithms can be worse than
SL on some datasets.
? However, this can be prevented. We show that
CV can be used to select SL/SSL to achieve
agnostic SSL, whose performance is almost al-
ways no worse than SL. Traditionally, CV is
19
often dismissed as unreliable for SSL because
of the small labeled dataset size. But we show
that CV is effective when using accuracy as an
optimization criterion, even when the labeled
dataset size is as small as 10.
? We show the power of cloud computing: we
were able to complete roughly 3 months worth
of experiments in less than a week.
2 SSL with Realistic Tuning
Given a particular labeled and unlabeled dataset,
how should you set parameters for a particular SSL
model? The most realistic approach for a practi-
tioner is to use CV to tune parameters on a grid. We
therefore argue that the model parameters obtained
in this way truly determine how SSL will perform
in practice. Algorithm 1 describes a particular in-
stance1 of CV in detail. We call it ?RealSSL,? as
this is all a real user can hope to do when applying
SSL (and SL too) in a realistic problem scenario.
3 Experimental Procedure
Given the RealSSL procedure in Algorithm 1, we
designed an experimental setup to simulate differ-
ent settings that a real-world practitioner might face
when given a new task and a set of algorithms to
choose from (some of which use unlabeled data).
This will allow us to compare algorithms across
datasets in a variety of situations. Algorithm 2
measures the performance of one algorithm on one
dataset for several different l and u combinations.
Specifically, we consider l ? {10, 100} and u ?
{100, 1000}. For each combination, we perform
multiple trials (T = 10 here) using different random
assignments of data to Dlabeled and Dunlabeled, to
obtain confidence intervals around our performance
measurements. All random selections of subsets of
data are the same across different algorithms? runs,
to permit paired t-tests for evaluation. Note that,
when l 6= max(L) or u 6= max(U), a portion of
Dpool is not used for training. Also, the RealSSL
procedure ensures that all parameters are tuned by
cross-validation without ever seeing the held-out

and unlabeled data, and the parameter grid, is important too.
But we view them as secondary to the fact that we are tuning
SSL by CV.
test set Dtest. Lastly, we stress that the same grid
of algorithm-specific parameter values (discussed in
Section 5) is considered for all datasets.
4 Datasets
Table 1 summarizes the datasets used for the com-
parisons. In this study we consider only binary clas-
sification tasks. Note that d is the number of dimen-
sions, P (y = 1) is the proportion of instances in
the full dataset belonging to class y = 1, and |Dtest|
refers to the size of the test set (the instances remain-
ing after max(L) + max(U) = 1100 have been set
aside for training trials).
[MacWin] is the Mac versus Windows text clas-
sification data from the 20-newsgroups dataset, pre-
processed by the authors of (Sindhwani et al, 2005).
[Interest] is a binary version of the word sense
disambiguation data from (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994).
The task is to distinguish the sense of ?interest?
meaning ?money paid for the use of money? from
the other five senses (e.g., ?readiness to give atten-
tion,? ?a share in a company or business?). The
data comes from a corpus of part-of-speech (POS)
tagged sentences containing the word ?interest.?
Each instance is a bag-of-word/POS vector, exclud-
ing words containing the root ?interest? and those
that appeared in less than three sentences overall.
Datasets [aut-avn] and [real-sim] are the
auto/aviation and real/simulated text classification
datasets from the SRAA corpus of UseNet articles.
The [ccat] and [gcat] datasets involve identifying
corporate and government articles, respectively, in
the RCV1 corpus. We use the versions of these
datasets prepared by the authors of (Sindhwani et
al., 2006).
Finally, the two WISH datasets come from (Gold-
berg et al, 2009) and involve discriminating be-
tween sentences that contain wishful expressions
and those that do not. The instances in [WISH-
politics] correspond to sentences taken from a po-
litical discussion board, while [WISH-products] is
based on sentences from Amazon product reviews.
The features are a combination of word and template
features as described in (Goldberg et al, 2009).

5 Algorithms
We consider only linear classifiers for this study,
since they tend to work well for text problems. In
future work, we plan to explore a range of kernels
and other non-linear classifiers.
As a baseline supervised learning method, we use
a support vector machine (SVM), as implemented
by SVMlight (Joachims, 1999). This baseline simply
ignores all the unlabeled data (xl+1, . . . ,xn). Recall
this solves the following regularized risk minimiza-
tion problem
min

max(0, 1 ? yif(xi)), (1)
where f(x) = w>x + b, and C is a parame-
ter controlling the trade-off between training er-
rors and model complexity. Using the procedure
outlined above, we tune C over a grid of values
{10?6, 10?5, 10?4, 10?3, 10?2, 10?1, 1, 10, 100}.
We consider two popular SSL algorithms, which
make different assumptions about the link between
the marginal data distribution Px and the conditional
label distribution Py|x. If the assumption does not
hold in a particular dataset, the SSL algorithm could
use the unlabeled data ?incorrectly,? and perform
worse than SL.
The first SSL algorithm we use is a semi-
supervised support vector machine (S3VM), which
makes the cluster assumption: the classes are well-
separated clusters of data, such that the decision
boundary falls into a low density region in the fea-
ture space. While many implementations exist,
we chose the deterministic annealing (DA) algo-
rithm implemented in the SVMlin package (Sind-
hwani et al, 2006; Sindhwani and Keerthi, 2007).
This DA algorithm often achieved the best accu-
racy across several datasets in the empirical com-
parison in (Sindhwani and Keerthi, 2007), despite
being slower than the multi-switch algorithm pre-
sented in the same paper. Note that the transductive
SVM implemented in SVMlight would have been
prohibitively slow to carry out the range of exper-
iments conducted here. Recall that an S3VM seeks
an optimal classifier f? that cuts through a region of
low density between clusters of data. One way to
view this is that it tries to find the best possible la-
beling of the unlabeled data such the classifier maxi-
mizes the margin on both labeled and unlabeled data
points. This is achieved by solving the following
non-convex minimization problem

subject to a class-balance constraint. Note that
V is a loss function (typically the hinge loss
as in (1)), and the parameters ?, ?? control the
relative importance of model complexity versus
locating a low-density region within the unlabeled
data. We tune both parameters in a grid of values
{10?6, 10?5, 10?4, 10?3, 10?2, 10?1, 1, 10, 100}.
In past studies (Sindhwani et al, 2006), ? was set to
1, and ?? was tuned over a grid containing a subset
of these values.
Finally, as an example of a graph-based
SSL method, we consider manifold regularization
(MR) (Belkin et al, 2006), using the implementa-
tion provided on the authors? Web site.2 This algo-
rithm makes the manifold assumption: the labels are
?smooth? with respect to a graph connecting labeled
and unlabeled instances. In other words, if two in-
stances are connected by a strong edge (e.g., they
are highly similar to one another), their labels tend
to be the same. Manifold regularization represents a
family of methods; we specifically use the Laplacian
SVM, which extends the basic SVM optimization

where ?A and ?I are parameters that trade off am-

per, we consider kNN graphs with k ? {3, 10, 20}.
Edge weights are formed using a heat kernel wij =
exp(? ||xi?xj ||22?2 ), where ? is set to be the mean dis-
tance between nearest neighbors in the graph, as
in (Chapelle et al, 2006). The ? parameters are each
tuned over the grid {10?6, 10?4, 10?2, 1, 100}.
Of course, many other SSL algorithms exist, some
of which combine different assumptions (Chapelle
and Zien, 2005; Karlen et al, 2008), and others
which exploit multiple (real or artificial) views of
the data (Blum and Mitchell, 1998; Sindhwani and
Rosenberg, 2008). We plan to extend our study to
include many more diverse SSL algorithms in the
future.
6 Choosing an Algorithm for a Real-World
Task
Given the choice of several algorithms, how should
one choose the best one to apply to a particular learn-
ing setting? Traditionally, CV is used for model
selection in supervised learning settings. However,
with only a small amount of labeled data in semi-
supervised settings, model selection with CV is of-
ten viewed as unreliable. We explicitly tested this
hypothesis by using CV to not only choose the pa-
rameters of the model, but also choose the type of
model itself. The main goal is to automatically
choose between SVM, S3VM, and MR for a par-
ticular learning setting, in an attempt to ensure that
the final performance is never hurt by including un-
labeled data (which might be called agnostic SSL).
Given a set of algorithms (e.g., one SL, several
SSL), the procedure is the following:
1. Tune the parameters of each algorithm on the
labeled and unlabeled training set using Algo-
rithm 1.3
2. Compare the best tuning performance (5-fold
CV average) achieved by the optimal parame-
ters for each of the algorithms.
? If there are no ties, select the algorithm
with the highest tuning performance.
? If there is a tie, and SL is among the best,
select SL.
? If there is a tie between SSL algorithms,
select one of them at random.
3. Use the selected ?Best Tuning? algorithm (and
the tuned parameters) to build a model on all
the training data; then apply it to the test data.
Note that the procedure is conservative in that it
prefers SL in the case of ties. In this paper, we use
this simple ?best tuning performance? heuristic.
Finally, we stress the fact that, when applying
this procedure within the context of Algorithm 2, a
potentially different algorithm is chosen in each of
the 10 trials for a particular setting. This simulates
the real-world scenario where one only has a single
fixed training set of labeled and unlabeled data and
must choose a single algorithm to produce a model
for future predictions.
7 Performance Metrics
We compare different algorithms? performance us-
ing three metrics often used for evaluation in NLP
tasks: accuracy, maxF1, and AUROC. Accuracy
is simply the fraction of instances correctly classi-
fied. MaxF1 is the maximal F1 value (harmonic
mean of recall and precision) achieved over the en-
tire precision-recall curve (Cai and Hofmann, 2003).
AUROC is the area under the ROC curve (Fawcett,
2004). Throughout the paper, when we discuss a
result involving a particular metric, the algorithms
use this metric as the criterion for parameter tuning,
and we use it for the final evaluation. We are not
simply evaluating a single experiment using multi-
ple metrics?the experiments are fundamentally dif-
ferent and produce different learned models.
3We ensure each algorithm uses the same 5 partitions during
the tuning step.

8 Results
We now report the results of our empirical compar-
ison of SL and SSL on the eight NLP datasets. We
first consider each dataset separately and examine
how often each type of algorithm outperforms the
other. We then examine cross-dataset performance.
8.1 Detailed Results
Table 2 contains all results for SVM, S3VM, and
MR for all datasets and all metrics.4 Note that within
each l,u cell for a particular dataset and evaluation
metric, we show the maximum value in each row
(tune, transductive, or test) in boldface. Results that
are not statistically significantly different using a
paired t-test are also shown in boldface.
Several things are immediately obvious from Ta-
ble 2. First, no algorithm is superior in all datasets
or settings. In several cases, all algorithms are statis-
tically indistinguishable. Most importantly, though,
each of the SSL algorithms can be worse than SL on
some datasets using some metric. We used paired
t-tests to compare transductive and test performance
of each SSL algorithm with SVM for a particular l,u
combination and dataset (32 settings total per evalu-
ation metric). In terms of accuracy, MR transductive
performance is significantly worse than SVM in 5
settings, while MR test performance is significantly
worse in 7 settings. MR is also significantly worse in
4 settings based on transductive maxF1, in 3 settings
based on transductive AUROC, and 1 setting based
on test AUROC. S3VM is significantly worse than
SVM in 2 settings based on transductive maxF1, 2
settings based on transductive AUROC, and in 1 set-
ting based on test AUROC. While these numbers
may seem relatively low, it is important to realize
that each algorithm may be worse than SSL many
times on a trial-by-trial basis, which is the more real-
istic scenario: a practitioner has only a single dataset
to work with. Results based on individual trials are
discussed below shortly.
4Note that the results here for a particular dataset and algo-
rithm combination may be qualitatively and quantitatively dif-
ferent than in previous published work, due to differences in
parameter tuning, choices of parameter grids, l and u sizes, and
randomization. We are not trying to replicate or raise doubt
about past results: we simply intend to compare algorithms on
a wide array of datasets using the standardized procedures out-
lined above.
We also applied our ?Best Tuning? model selec-
tion procedure to automatically choose a single al-
gorithm for each trial in each setting. We compare
average SL test performance versus the average test
performance of the Best Tuning selections across the
10 trials (not shown in Table 2). Comparisons based
on transductive performance are similar. When the
performance metric is test accuracy, the Best Tuning
algorithm performs statistically significantly better
than SL in 24 settings and worse in only 6 settings.
In the remaining 2 settings, Best Tuning chose SL
in all 10 trials, so they are equivalent. These results
suggest that accuracy-based tuning is a valid method
for choosing a SSL algorithm to improve accuracy
on test data. To some extent, this holds for maxF1,
too: the Best Tuning selections perform better than
SL (on average) in 18 settings and worse in 14 set-
tings when tuning and test evaluation is based on
maxF1. However, when using AUROC as the per-
formance metric, cross validation seems to be unre-
liable: Best Tuning produces a better result in only
11 out of the 32 settings.
8.2 Results Aggregated Across Datasets
We now aggregate the detailed results to better un-
derstand the relative performance of the different
methods across all datasets. We perform this sum-
mary evaluation in two ways, based on test set
performance (transductive performance is similar).
First, we compare the SSL algorithms across all
datasets based on the numbers of times each is worse
than, the same as, or better than SL. For each of
the 80 trials of a particular l,u,metric combination,
we compare the performance of S3VM, MR, and
Best Tuning to SVM. Note that each of these com-
parisons is akin to a real-world scenario where a
practitioner would have to choose an algorithm to
use. Table 3 lists tuples of the form ?(#trials worse
than SVM, #trials equal to SVM, #trials better than
SVM).? Note that the numbers in each tuple sum to
80. The perfect SSL algorithm would have a tuple of
?(0, 0, 80),? meaning that it always outperforms SL.
In terms of accuracy (Table 3, top) and maxF1 (Ta-
ble 3, middle), the Best Tuning method turns out to
do worse than SVM less often than either S3VM or
MR does (i.e., the first number in the tuples for Best
Tuning is lower than the corresponding numbers for
the other algorithms). At the same time, Best Tuning

Table 4: Aggregate test results averaged over the 80 trials (8 datasets, 10 trials each) in a particular setting.
outperforms SVM in fewer trials than the other algo-
rithms in some settings for these two metrics. This
is because Best Tuning conservatively selects SVM
in many trials. The take home message is that tuning
using CV based on accuracy (and to a lesser extent
maxF1) appears to mitigate some risk involved in
applying SSL. AUROC, on the other hand, does not
appear as effective for this purpose. Table 3 (bottom)
shows that, for u = 1000, Best Tuning is worse than
SVM fewer times, but for u = 100, MR achieves
better performance overall.
We also compare overall average test performance
(across datasets) for each metric and l,u combina-
tion. Table 4 reports these results for accuracy,
maxF1, and AUROC. In terms of accuracy, we see
that the Best Tuning approach leads to better per-
formance than SVM, S3VM, or MR in all settings
when averaged over datasets. We appear to achieve
some synergy in dynamically choosing a different
algorithm in each trial. In terms of maxF1, Best
Tuning, S3VM, and MR are all at least as good as
SL in three of the four l,u settings, and nearly as
good in the fourth. Based on AUROC, though, the
results are mixed depending on the specific setting.
Notably, though, Best Tuning consistently leads to
worse performance than SL when using this metric.
8.3 A Note on Cloud Computing
The experiments were carried out using the Condor
High-Throughput Computing platform (Thain et al,
2005). We ran many trials per algorithm (using dif-
ferent datasets, l, u, and metrics). Each trial in-
volved training hundreds of models using different
parameter configurations repeated across five folds,
and then training once more using the selected pa-
rameters. In the end, we trained a grand total of
794,880 individual models to produce the results in
Table 2. Through distributed computing on approxi-
mately 50 machines in parallel, we were able to run
all these experiments in less than a week, while us-
ing roughly three months worth of CPU time.
9 Conclusions
We have explored ?realistic SSL,? where all parame-
ters are tuned via 5-fold cross validation, to simulate
a real-world experience of trying to use unlabeled
data in a novel NLP task. Our medium-scale empir-
ical study of SVM, S3VM, and MR revealed that no
algorithm is always superior, and furthermore that
there are cases in which each SSL algorithm we ex-
amined can perform worse than SVM (in some cases
significantly worse across 10 trials). To mitigate
such risks, we proposed a simple meta-level proce-
dure that selects one of the three models based on
tuning performance. While cross validation is often
dismissed for model selection in SSL due to a lack
of labeled data, this Best Tuning approach proves ef-
fective in helping to ensure that incorporating unla-
beled data does not hurt performance. Interestingly,
this works well only when optimizing accuracy dur-
ing tuning. For future work, we plan to extend this
study to include additional datasets, algorithms, and
tuning criteria. We also plan to develop more so-
phisticated techniques for choosing which SL/SSL
algorithm to use in practice.
