Abstract
We present a unified view of many trans-
lation algorithms that synthesizes work on
deductive parsing, semiring parsing, and
efficient approximate search algorithms.
This gives rise to clean analyses and com-
pact descriptions that can serve as the ba-
sis for modular implementations. We illus-
trate this with several examples, showing
how to build search spaces for several dis-
parate phrase-based search strategies, inte-
grate non-local features, and devise novel
models. Although the framework is drawn
from parsing and applied to translation, it
is applicable to many dynamic program-
ming problems arising in natural language
processing and other areas.
1 Introduction
Implementing a large-scale translation system is
a major engineering effort requiring substantial
time and resources, and understanding the trade-
offs involved in model and algorithm design de-
cisions is important for success. As the space of
systems described in the literature becomes more
crowded, identifying their common elements and
isolating their differences becomes crucial to this
understanding. In this work, we present a com-
mon framework for model manipulation and anal-
ysis that accomplishes this, and use it to derive sur-
prising conclusions about phrase-based models.
Most translation algorithms do the same thing:
dynamic programming search over a space of
weighted rules (?2). Fortunately, we need
not search far for modular descriptions of dy-
namic programming algorithms. Deductive logic
(Pereira and Warren, 1983), extended with semir-
ings (Goodman, 1999), is an established formal-
ism used in parsing. It is occasionally used
to describe formally syntactic translation mod-
els, but these treatments tend to be brief (Chiang,
2007; Venugopal et al, 2007; Dyer et al, 2008;
Melamed, 2004). We apply weighted deduction
much more thoroughly, first extending it to phrase-
based models and showing that the set of search
strategies used by these models have surprisingly
different implications for model and search error
(?3, ?4). We then show how it can be used to an-
alyze common translation problems such as non-
local parameterizations (?5), alignment, and novel
model design (?6). Finally, we show that it leads to
a simple analysis of cube pruning (Chiang, 2007),
an important approximate search algorithm (?7).
2 Translation Models
A translation model consists of two distinct ele-
ments: an unweighted ruleset, and a parameteriza-
tion (Lopez, 2008). A ruleset licenses the steps by
which a source string f1...fI may be rewritten as
a target string e1...eJ , thereby defining the finite
set of all possible rewritings of a source string. A
parameterization defines a weight function over
every sequence of rule applications.
In a phrase-based model, the ruleset is simply
the unweighted phrase table, where each phrase
pair fi...fi?/ej ...ej? states that phrase fi...fi? in the
source is rewritten as ej ...ej? in the the target.
The model operates by iteratively applying
rewrites to the source sentence until each source
word has been consumed by exactly one rule. We
call a sequence of rule applications a derivation.
A target string e1...eJ yielded by a derivation D is
obtained by concatenating the target phrases of the
rules in the order in which they were applied. We
define Y (D) to be the target string yielded by D.
532
Now consider the Viterbi approximation to a
noisy channel parameterization of this model,
P (f |D) ? P (D).1 We define P (f |D) in the stan-
dard way.
P (f |D) =
?
fi...fi?/ej ...ej??D
p(fi...fi? |ej ...ej?)
(1)
Note that in the channel model, we can replace any
rule application with any other rule containing the
same source phrase without affecting the partial
score of the rest of the derivation. We call this a
local parameterization.
Now we define a standard n-gram model P (D).
P (D) =
?
ej?Y (D)
p(ej |ej?n+1...ej?1) (2)
This parameterization differs from the channel
model in an important way. If we replace a single
rule in the derivation, the partial score of the rest
of derivation is also affected, because the terms
ej?n+1...ej may come from more than one rule. In
other words, this parameterization encodes a de-
pendency between the steps in a derivation. We
call this a non-local parameterization.
3 Translation As Deduction
For the first part of the discussion that follows, we
consider deductive logics purely over unweighted
rulesets. As a way to introduce deductive logic, we
consider the CKY algorithm for context-free pars-
ing, a common example that we will revisit in ?6.2.
It is also relevant since it can form the basis of a
decoder for inversion transduction grammar (Wu,
1996). In the discussion that follows, we useA,B,
and C to denote arbitrary nonterminal symbols, S
to denote the start nonterminal symbol, and a to
denote a terminal symbol. CKY works on gram-
mars in Chomsky normal form: all rules are either
binary as in A? BC, or unary as in A? a.
The number of possible binary-branching
parses of a sentence is defined by the Catalan num-
ber, an exponential combinatoric function (Church
and Patil, 1982), so dynamic programming is cru-
cial for efficiency. CKY computes all parses in
cubic time by reusing subparses. To parse a sen-
tence a1...aK , we compute a set of items in the
form [A, k, k?], whereA is a nonterminal category,
1The true noisy channel parameterization p(f |e) ? p(e)
would require a marginalization over D, and is intractable
for most models.
k and k? are both integers in the range [0, n]. This
item represents the fact that there is some parse of
span ak+1...ak? rooted at A (span indices are on
the spaces between words). CKY works by creat-
ing items over successively longer spans. First it
creates items [A, k?1, k] for any ruleA? a such
that a = ak. It then considers spans of increasing
length, creating items [A, k, k?] whenever it finds
two items [B, k, k??] and [C, k??, k?] for some gram-
mar ruleA? BC and some midpoint k??. Its goal
is an item [S, 0,K], indicating that there is a parse
of a1...aK rooted at S.
A CKY logic describes its actions as inference
rules, equivalent to Horn clauses. The inference
rule is a list of antecedents, items and rules that
must all be true for the inference to occur; and a
single consequent that is inferred. To denote the
creation of item [A, k, k?] based on existence of
rule A? BC and items [B, k, k??] and [C, k??, k?],
we write an inference rule with antecedents on the
top line and consequent on the second line, follow-
ing Goodman (1999) and Shieber et al (1995).
R(A? BC) [B, k, k??] [C, k??, k?]
[A, k, k?]
We now give the complete Logic CKY.

(Logic CKY)
A benefit of this declarative description is that
complexity can be determined by inspection
(McAllester, 1999). We elaborate on complexity
in ?7, but for now it suffices to point out that the
number of possible items and possible deductions
depends on the product of the domains of the free
variables. For example, the number of possible
CKY items for a grammar with G nonterminals
is O(GK2), because k and k? are both in range
[0,K]. Likewise, the number of possible inference
rules that can fire is O(G3K3).
3.1 A Simple Deductive Decoder
For our first example of a translation logic we con-
sider a simple case: monotone decoding (Marin?o
et al, 2006; Zens and Ney, 2004). Here, rewrite
rules are applied strictly from left to right on the
source sentence. Despite its simplicity, the search
533
space can be very large?in the limit there could
be a translation for every possible segmentation
of the sentence, so there are exponentially many
possible derivations. Fortunately, we know that
monotone decoding can easily be cast as a dy-
namic programming problem. For any position i
in the source sentence f1...fI , we can freely com-
bine any partial derivation covering f1...fi on its
left with any partial derivation covering fi+1...fI
on its right to yield a complete derivation.
In our deductive program for monotone decod-
ing, an item simply encodes the index of the right-
most word that has been rewritten.
item form: [i]
goal: [I]
rule:
[i] R(fi+1...fi?/ej ...ej?)
[i?]
(Logic MONOTONE)
This is the algorithm of Zens and Ney (2004).
With a maximum phrase length of m, i? will range
over [i+1,min(i+m, I)], giving a complexity of
O(Im). In the limit it is O(I2).
3.2 More Complex Decoders
Now we consider phrase-based decoders with
more permissive reordering. In the limit we al-
low arbitrary reordering, so our item must contain
a coverage vector. Let V be a binary vector of
length I; that is, V ? {0, 1}I . Le 0m be a vec-
tor of m 0?s. For example, bit vector 00000 will
be abbreviated 05 and bit vector 000110 will be
abbreviated 031201. Finally, we will need bitwise
AND (?) and OR (?). Note that we impose an ad-
ditional requirement that is not an item in the de-
ductive system as a side condition (we elaborate
on the significance of this in ?4).
item form: [{0, 1}I ] goal: [1I ]
rule:
[V ] R(fi+1...fi?/ej ...ej?)
[V ? 0i1i??i0I?i? ]
V ? 0i1i
??i0I?i
?
= 0I
(Logic PHRASE-BASED)
The runtime complexity is exponential, O(I22I).
Practical decoding strategies are more restrictive,
implementing what is frequently called a distor-
tion limit or reordering limit. We found that these
terms are inexact, used to describe a variety of
quite different strategies.2 Since we did not feel
that the relationship between these various strate-
gies was obvious or well-known, we give logics
2Costa-jussa` and Fonollosa (2006) refer to the reordering
limit and distortion limit as two distinct strategies.
for several of them and a brief analysis of the
implications. Each strategy uses a parameter d,
generically called the distortion limit or reorder-
ing limit.
The Maximum Distortion d strategy (MDd)
requires that the first word of a phrase chosen for
translation be within d words of the the last word
of the most recently translated phrase (Figure 1).3
The effect of this strategy is that, up to the last
word covered in a partial derivation, there must be
a covered word in every d words. Its complexity
is O(I32d).
MDd can produce partial derivations that cannot
be completed by any allowed sequence of jumps.
To prevent this, the Window Length d strategy
(WLd) enforces a tighter restriction that the last
word of a phrase chosen for translation cannot be
more than d words from the leftmost untranslated
word in the source (Figure 1).4 For this logic we
use a bitwise shift operator (), and a predicate
(?1) that counts the number of leading ones in a
bit array.5 Its runtime is exponential in parameter
d, but linear in sentence length, O(d22dI).
The First d Uncovered Words strategy
(FdUW) is described by Tillman and Ney (2003)
and Zens and Ney (2004), who call it the IBM
Constraint.6 It requires at least one of the leftmost
d uncovered words to be covered by a new phrase.
Items in this strategy contain the index i of the
rightmost covered word and a vector U ? [1, I]d
of the d leftmost uncovered words (Figure 1). Its
complexity is O(dI
( I
d+1
)
), which is roughly ex-
ponential in d.
There are additional variants, such as the Maxi-
mum Jump d strategy (MJd), a polynomial-time
strategy described by Kumar and Byrne (2005),
and possibly others. We lack space to describe all
of them, but simply depicting the strategies as log-
ics permits us to make some simple analyses.
First, it should be clear that these reorder-
ing strategies define overlapping but not identical
search spaces: for most values of d it is impossi-
ble to find d? such that any of the other strategies
would be identical (except for degenerate cases
3Moore and Quirk (2007) give a nice description of MDd.
4We do not know if WLd is documented anywhere, but
from inspection it is used in Moses (Koehn et al, 2007). This
was confirmed by Philipp Koehn and Hieu Hoang (p.c.).
5When a phrase covers the first uncovered word in the
source sentence, the new first uncovered word may be further
along in the sentence (if the phrase completely filled a gap),
or just past the end of the phrase (otherwise).
6We could not identify this strategy in the IBM patents.

d = 0 and d = I). This has important ramifi-
cations for scientific studies: results reported for
one strategy may not hold for others, and in cases
where the strategy is not clearly described it may
be impossible to replicate results. Furthermore, it
should be clear that the strategy can have signifi-
cant impact on decoding speed and pruning strate-
gies (?7). For example, MDd is more complex
than WLd, and we expect implementations of the
former to require more pruning and suffer from
more search errors, while the latter would suffer
from more model errors since its space of possible
reorderings is smaller.
We emphasize that many other translation mod-
els can be described this way. Logics for the IBM
Models (Brown et al, 1993) would be similar to
our logics for phrase-based models. Syntax-based
translation logics are similar to parsing logics; a
few examples already appear in the literature (Chi-
ang, 2007; Venugopal et al, 2007; Dyer et al,
2008; Melamed, 2004). For simplicity, we will
use the MONOTONE logic for the remainder of our
examples, but all of them generalize to more com-
plex logics.
4 Adding Local Parameterizations via
Semiring-Weighted Deduction
So far we have focused solely on unweighted log-
ics, which correspond to search using only rule-
sets. Now we turn our focus to parameterizations.
As a first step, we consider only local parame-
terizations, which make computing the score of a
derivation quite simple. We are given a set of in-
ferences in the following form (interpreting side
conditions B1...BM as boolean constraints).
A1...AL
C
B1...BM
Now suppose we want to find the highest-scoring
derivation. Each antecedent item A` has a proba-
bility p(A`): if A` is a rule, then the probability is
given, otherwise its probability is computed recur-
sively in the same way that we now compute p(C).
Since C can be the consequent of multiple deduc-
tions, we take the max of its current value (initially
0) and the result of the new deduction.
p(C) = max(p(C), (p(A1)? ...? p(AL))) (3)
If for every A` that is an item, we replace p(A`)
recursively with this expression, we end up with a
maximization over a product of rule probabilities.
Applying this to logic MONOTONE, the result will
be a maximization (over all possible derivations
D) of the algebraic expression in Equation 1.
We might also want to calculate the total prob-
ability of all possible derivations, which is useful
for parameter estimation (Blunsom et al, 2008).
We can do this using the following equation.
p(C) = p(C) + (p(A1)? ...? p(AL)) (4)
535
Equations 3 and 4 are quite similar. This suggests
a useful generalization: semiring-weighted deduc-
tion (Goodman, 1999).7 A semiring ?A,?,??
consists of a domain A, a multiplicative opera-
tor ? and an additive operator ?.8 In Equa-
tion 3 we use the Viterbi semiring ?[0, 1],?,max?,
while in Equation 4 we use the inside semiring
?[0, 1],?,+?. The general form of Equations 3
and 4 can be written for weights w ? A.
w(C)?= w(A1)? ...? w(A`) (5)
Many quantities can be computed simply by us-
ing the appropriate semiring. Goodman (1999) de-
scribes semirings for the Viterbi derivation, k-best
Viterbi derivations, derivation forest, and num-
ber of paths.9 Eisner (2002) describes the expec-
tation semiring for parameter learning. Gimpel
and Smith (2009) describe approximation semir-
ings for approximate summing in (usually in-
tractable) models. In parsing, the boolean semir-
ing ?{>,?},?,?? is used to determine grammati-
cality of an input string. In translation it is relevant
for alignment (?6.1).
5 Adding Non-Local Parameterizations
with the PRODUCT Transform
A problem arises with the semiring-weighted de-
ductive formalism when we add non-local parame-
terizations such as an n-gram model (Equation 2).
Suppose we have a derivation D = (d1, ..., dM ),
where each dm is a rule application. We can view
the language model as a function on D.
P (D) = f(d1, ..., dm, ..., dM ) (6)
The problem is that replacing dm with a lower-
scoring rule d?m may actually improve f due to
the language model dependency. This means that
f is nonmonotonic?it does not display the opti-
mal substructure property on partial derivations,
which is required for dynamic programming (Cor-
men et al, 2001). The logics still work for some
semirings (e.g. boolean), but not others. There-
fore, non-local parameterizations break semiring-
weighted deduction, because we can no longer use
7General weighted deduction subsumes semiring-
weighted deduction (Eisner et al, 2005; Eisner and Blatz,
2006; Nederhof, 2003), but semiring-weighted deduction
covers all translation models we are aware of, so it is a good
first step in applying weighted deduction to translation.
8See Goodman (1999) for additional conditions on semir-
ings used in this framework.
9Eisner and Blatz (2006) give an alternate strategy for the
best derivation.
the same logic under all semirings. We need new
logics; for this we will use a logic programming
transform called the PRODUCT transform (Cohen
et al, 2008).
We first define a logic for the non-local param-
eterization. The logic for an n-gram language
model generates sequence e1...eQ by generating
each new word given the past n? 1 words.10
item form: [eq, ..., eq+n?2] goal: [eQ?n+2, ..., eQ]
rule:
[eq, ..., eq+n?2]R(eq, ..., eq+n?1)
[eq+1, ..., eq+n?1]
(Logic NGRAM)
Now we want to combine NGRAM and MONO-
TONE. To make things easier, we modify MONO-
TONE to encode the idea that once a source phrase
has been recognized, its target words are gener-
ated one at a time. We will use ue and ve to denote
(possibly empty) sequences in ej ...e?j . Borrowing
the notation of Earley (1970), we encode progress
using a dotted phrase ue ? ve.
item form: [i, ue ? ve] goal: [I, ue ? ve]
rules:
[i, ue?] R(fi+1...fi?/ejve)
[i?, ej ? ve]
[i, ue ? ejve]
[i, ueej ? ve]
(Logic MONOTONE-GENERATE)
We combine NGRAM and MONOTONE-
GENERATE using the PRODUCT transform,
which takes two logics as input and essentially
does the following.11
1. Create a new item type from the cross-
product of item types in the input logics.
2. Create inference rules for the new item type
from the cross-product of all inference rules
in the input logics.
3. Constrain the new logic as needed. This is
done by hand, but quite simple, as we will
show by example.
The first two steps give us logic MONOTONE-
GENERATE ? NGRAM (Figure 2). This is close to
what we want, but not quite done. The constraint
we want to apply is that each word written by logic
MONOTONE-GENERATE is equal to the word gen-
erated by logic NGRAM. We accomplish this by
unifying variables eq and en?i in the inference
rules, giving us logic MONOTONE-GENERATE +
NGRAM (Figure 2).
10We ignore start and stop probabilities for simplicity.
11The description of Cohen et al (2008) is much more
complete and includes several examples.

(3) MONOTONE-GENERATE + NGRAM SINGLE-SHOT.
This logic restores the optimal subproblem
property and we can apply semiring-weighted de-
duction. Efficient algorithms are given in ?7, but
a brief comment is in order about the new logic.
In most descriptions of phrase-based decoding,
the n-gram language model is applied all at once.
MONOTONE-GENERATE+NGRAM applies the n-
gram language model one word at a time. This
illuminates a space of search strategies that are to
our knowledge unexplored. If a four-word phrase
were proposed as an extension of a partial hypoth-
esis in a typical decoder implementation using a
five-word language model, all four n-grams will
be applied even though the first n-gram might have
a very low score. Viewing each n-gram applica-
tion as producing a new state may yield new strate-
gies for approximate search.
We can derive the more familiar logic by ap-
plying a different transform: unfolding (Eisner
and Blatz, 2006). The idea is to replace an item
with the sequence of antecedents used to pro-
duce it (similar to function inlining). This gives
us MONOTONE-GENERATE+NGRAM SINGLE-
SHOT (Figure 2).
We call the ruleset-based logic the minimal
logic and the logic enhanced with non-local pa-
rameterization the complete logic. Note that the
set of variables in the complete logic is a superset
of the set of variables in the minimal logic. We
can view the minimal logic as a projection of the
complete logic into a smaller dimensional space.
It is important to note that complete logic is sub-
stantially more complex than the minimal logic,
by a factor of O(|VE |n) for a target vocabulary of
VE . Thus, the complexity of non-local parameteri-
zations often makes search spaces large regardless
of the complexity of the minimal logic.
6 Other Uses of the PRODUCT Transform
The PRODUCT transform can also implement
alignment and help derive new models.
6.1 Alignment
In the alignment problem (sometimes called con-
strained decoding or forced decoding), we are
given a reference target sentence r1, ..., rJ , and
we require the translation model to generate only
derivations that produce that sentence. Alignment
is often used in training both generative and dis-
criminative models (Brown et al, 1993; Blunsom
et al, 2008; Liang et al, 2006). Our approach to
alignment is similar to the one for language mod-
eling. First, we implement a logic requiring an
537
input to be identical to the reference.
item form: [j]
goal: [J ]
rule:
[j]
[j + 1]
ej+1 = rj+1
(Logic RECOGNIZE)
The logic only reaches its goal if the input is iden-
tical to the reference. In fact, partial derivations
must produce a prefix of the reference. When we
combine this logic with MONOTONE-GENERATE,
we obtain a logic that only succeeds if the transla-
tion logic generates the reference.
item form: [i, j, ue ? ve] goal: [I, j, ue?]
rules:
?
????
????
[i, j, ue?] R(fi...fi?/ej ...ej?)
[i?, j, ?ej ...ej? ]
[i, j, ue ? ejve]
[i, j + 1, ueej ? ve]
ej+1 = rj+1
(Logic MONOTONE-ALIGN)
Under the boolean semiring, this (minimal) logic
decides if a training example is reachable by the
model, which is required by some discriminative
training regimens (Liang et al, 2006; Blunsom et
al., 2008). We can also compute the Viterbi deriva-
tion or the sum over all derivations of a training
example, needed for some parameter estimation
methods. Cohen et al (2008) derive an alignment
logic for ITG from the product of two CKY logics.
6.2 Translation Model Design
A motivation for many syntax-based translation
models is to use target-side syntax as a language
model (Charniak et al, 2003). Och et al (2004)
showed that simply parsing the N -best outputs
of a phrase-based model did not work; to ob-
tain the full power of a language model, we need
to integrate it into the search process. Most ap-
proaches to this problem focus on synchronous
grammars, but it is possible to integrate the target-
side language model with a phrase-based transla-
tion model. As an exercise, we integrate CKY
with the output of logic MONOTONE-GENERATE.
The constraint is that the indices of the CKY items
unify with the items of the translation logic, which
form a word lattice. Note that this logic retains the
rules in the basic MONOTONE logic, which are not
depicted (Figure 3).
The result is a lattice parser on the output of the
translation model. Lattice parsing is not new to
translation (Dyer et al, 2008), but to our knowl-
edge it has not been used in this way. Viewing

translation as deduction is helpful for the design
and construction of novel models.
7 Algorithms
Most translation logics are too expensive to ex-
haustively search. However, the logics conve-
niently specify the full search space, which forms
a hypergraph (Klein and Manning, 2001).12 The
equivalence is useful for complexity analysis:
items correspond to nodes and deductions corre-
spond to hyperarcs. These equivalences make it
easy to compute algorithmic bounds.
Cube pruning (Chiang, 2007) is an approxi-
mate search technique for syntax-based translation
models with integrated language models. It op-
erates on two objects: a ?LM graph containing
no language model state, and a +LM hypergraph
containing state. The idea is to generate a fixed
number of nodes in the +LM for each node in
the ?LM graph, using a clever enumeration strat-
egy. We can view cube pruning as arising from
the interaction between a minimal logic and the
state splits induced by non-local features. Figure 4
shows how the added state information can dra-
matically increase the number of deductions that
must be evaluated. Cube pruning works by con-
sidering the most promising states paired with the
most promising extensions. In this way, it easily
fits any search space constructed using the tech-
nique of ?5. Note that the efficiency of cube prun-
ing is limited by the minimal logic.
Stack decoding is a search heuristic that simpli-
fies the complexity of searching a minimal logic.
Each item is associated with a stack whose signa-
12Specifically a B-hypergraph, equivalent to an and-or
graph (Gallo et al, 1993) or context-free grammar (Neder-
hof, 2003). In the degenerate case, this is simply a graph, as
is the case with most phrase-based models.

ture is a projection of the item signature (or a pred-
icate on the item signatures)?multiple items are
associated to the same stack. The strength of the
pruning (and resulting complexity improvements)
depending on how much the projection reduces the
search space. In many phrase-based implemen-
tations the stack signature is just the number of
words translated, but other strategies are possible
(Tillman and Ney, 2003).
It is worth noting that logic FdUW (?3.2), de-
pends on stack pruning for speed. Because the
number of stacks is linear in the length of the in-
put, so is the number of unpruned nodes in the
search graph. In contrast, the complexity of logic
WLd is naturally linear in input length. As men-
tioned in ?3.2, this implies a wide divergence in
the model and search errors of these logics, which
to our knowledge has not been investigated.
8 Related Work
We are not the first to observe that phrase-based
models can be represented as logic programs (Eis-
ner et al, 2005; Eisner and Blatz, 2006), but to
our knowledge we are the first to provide explicit
logics for them.13 We also showed that deductive
logic is a useful analytical tool to tackle a variety
of problems in translation algorithm design.
Our work is strongly influenced by Goodman
(1999) and Eisner et al (2005). They describe
many issues not mentioned here, including con-
ditions on semirings, termination conditions, and
strategies for cyclic search graphs. However,
while their weighted deductive formalism is gen-
eral, they focus on concerns relevant to parsing,
such as boolean semirings and cyclicity. Our work
focuses on concerns common for translation, in-
cluding a general view of non-local parameteriza-
tions and cube pruning.
13Huang and Chiang (2007) give an informal example, but
do not elaborate on it.
9 Conclusions and Future Work
We have described a general framework that syn-
thesizes and extends deductive parsing and semir-
ing parsing, and adapts it to translation. Our goal
has been to show that logics make an attractive
shorthand for description, analysis, and construc-
tion of translation models. For instance, we have
shown that it is quite easy to mechanically con-
struct search spaces using non-local features, and
to create exotic models. We showed that differ-
ent flavors of phrase-based models should suffer
from quite different types of error, a problem that
to our knowledge was heretofore unknown. How-
ever, we have only scratched the surface, and we
believe it is possibly to unify a wide variety of
translation algorithms. For example, we believe
that cube pruning can be described as an agenda
discipline in chart parsing (Kay, 1986).
Although the work presented here is abstract,
our motivation is practical. Isolating the errors
in translation systems is a difficult task which can
be made easier by describing and analyzing mod-
els in a modular way (Auli et al, 2009). Fur-
thermore, building large-scale translation systems
from scratch should be unnecessary if existing sys-
tems were built using modular logics and algo-
rithms. We aim to build such systems.
