A 'L;EXICON FOR A COMPUTER Q U F  ST!! ON-AHSWCRING SYSTEM 
An integral part of any natural language understanding sys tern, 
but one which has received very l i t t l e  a t t e n t i o n  i n  application, i s  
the lexicon. It i s  needed during the parsing of the input text for 
making inferences, and for generating language output or performing 
some action. This paper d i s c u s s e s  Lhe principal questions concern- 
ing the lexicon as i t  relates i n  particular t o  a question-answering 
system and proposes a specific type of lexicon to f u l f i l l  the needs 
o f  th is  system. 
Rather than make a d is t inct ion  between dictionary and encyclo- 
pedia, w e  have a single global data base which we c a l l  the lexicon. 
Homographs are differentiated and phrases with fixed meanings are 
treated as separate entries. A l l  the information in this lexicon 
is encoded i n  the form OZ relations and words or word senses. These 
form a large network w i t h  the words as nodes and the relations as 
edges. In addition the relations define semsntic f i e l d s  and these 
are used to  treat problems of ambiguity. Relations are use6 to en- 
code both syntactic and s m n t i c  information. Axiom schemes are 
associated with each relation and these are used f o r  inferencing. 
The lexical  re lat ions  then are at  the heart (or brain) of  the system 
for representation, re tr i eva l ,  and inferencfng. 
For each relation we describe its semantics and the axioms appro- 
priate to  i t .  In the positing of l e x i c a l  re lat ions  our a p p r e h  has 
been in? luenced by the work of 4presfan, Me1 cuk, and Zolkovs~y . The 
lexical relations we have p o s i t e d  are the t r ad i t iona l  svnonvmy and 
antonymy, taxonomy, part whole, gradfig and approximately f o r t y  o thers .  
The whole set, deliberately l e f t  open ended, is subdiudded i n t o  n i n ~  
subsets which include attribute relatibns, coLl~cational relations 
and paradigma ti* onEs. 
Each relation has its own lexical entry givhng its properties 
and t e l l i n g  how to interpret lexical relationships i n  a f i r s t  order 
predicate calculus form. lor example, the tnformatfon for the lext- 
cal entry dog gncludes t h e  statement dog T animal, that is, t ha t  a 
dog is a kind of mim~z. The lexical enfry f o r  T, the taxonomic re- 
lation, i n  its turn includes infprmatic , which allows the statement 
to be interpreted as 
HoZda(Ncom(dog,X)) - RoZds(lYcorn(anima1,X)). 
The inventory of relations i s  expandable simply by adding lexical  
entries for new relations. In a d d i t i o n  having both the lexical en- 
tries and the relations in the entrdes expressed in the same nota- 
t ional  form as t h a t  of input sentences, namely in a Eirst order 
predicate calculus notation, allows for a consistent,  coherent, and 
easily modifiable system for  analysis ,  inference, and s y n t h e b i ~ ,

I. INTRODUCTION 
The lexicon presented he re  is being developed a s  a n  i n t e g r a l  p a r t  
of a computer question-answering system which answers multiple-choice 
ques t ians  about simple c h i l d r e n ' s  s t o r i e s ,  It thus  must make informa- 
t i o n  r e a d i l y  ava i l ab l e  f o r  t h e  parsing process,  f o r  bu i ld ing  an i n t e r n a l  
nodel O F  t h e  s t o r y  being read,  and f o r  making inferences .  Knovledge 
nbout words and knowledge about the  world must both b e  s to red  i n  a com- 
pact bu t   mediately a c c e s s i b l e  form. 
Many decis ions  must be made, the re fore ,  about t h e  design of t he  
lexicon. The f i r s t  problem is t o  decide  on an o rgan iz ing  s t r u c t u r e ,  
Should Lexical and "encycloped~c" information be s to red  separately o r  
together?  Which ltems w i l l  have s e p a r a t e  l e x i k 3 l  entries? Which w i l l  
be included i n  o the r  e n t r i e s ?  What about homonymy and polysemy? What 
connecting l i n k s  between words and word senses  w i l l  be  recorded and how? 
The next problem i s  t o  determine a  c h a r a c t e r i z a t i o n  of word mean- 
ings.  This l e ads  t o  some deep t h e o r e t r c a l  questrohs What kind of 
l e x i c a l  semantic r ep re sen ta t i ons  are appropriate? What i s  t h e  structure 
o t  these  represefi tat ions? What are t h e  semantic primes, t he  elements of 
t h a t  s t r u c t u r e ?  The des ign  of the l e x i c a l  en t ry  i s  thus  sub jec t  t o  theo- 
r e t i c a l  b i a s e s  a s  w e l l  as the p r a c t i c a s  c o n s t r a j n t s  of space, r e t r f e v a l  
e f f k i e n c y ,  and e f f e c t i v e  support  of rnference-making. 
The dec i s ion  t o  u se  l e x i c a l  r e l a t i o n s  as fundamental elements of 
the strucl ture of t h e  l ex icon  has  s t rong ly  influenced our  design. Re la t ions  
a r e  w e d  t o  encode both semantic and syntactic information,  Axiom schemes 
e s s e n t i a l  t o  inferencing are assoc ia ted  wi th  each r e l a t i o n .  Relati-1 
informatgon makes up.a s i g n i f k a n t  part o f , t h e  lexical entry ,  
Lexical r e l a t i o n s  offer signif icant advantages. They aS.Low us to 
generalize familiar gnference patterns into axiom schemes. They can en- 
capsulate the defining formulae of the commercial dictidnary. They have 
an iritwitive appeal which w e  believe reflects a certain measure of psy- 
chological  rea l i ty .  On a pract ical  l eve l  they allbw~tls to  express both 
syntactic and semantic informa-tion i n  a form that i s  compact and eaay to  
retrieve. They can be used i n  many ways. For example, the following 
paragraph from a test administered to  f i r s t  and second graders-by , 
l oca l  school system says: 
(Pl) Ted has a puppy. H i s  name is Happy. 
Ted and Happy l i k e  to play. 
(Ql) The p e t  is  a: dog boy toy 
In order to  answer t h i s  question w e  need to know what p& means. In our 
Lexicon the lexical entry for pet contains a simple definition. a pet i s  
an animal that is owned by a human. In order to answer th i s  question w e  
also need to know that a puppy is a young dog. 'This information in pre- 
dicate calculus  form would be  p a r t  of  the lexical entry for  puxpy. W e  
would, of course, need axioms o f  the same form as w ' e l l  f o r  the entrqies 
for kitten, jamb, etc. Instead of such a representation w e  express th i s  
;information by uslnp, a l exical re lat ion,  CIIILD. The Lexical entry for 
puppy contdins CHILD Jog. S imi lar ly ,  the lexjcal entry for kitten con- 
tains CHILD cut; w h i l e  the lexical entry for CHILD contains the axio~tl 
scheme from which t h e  relevant axioms are formed when needed. 
We treat verb& in a s i m i l a r  way. Corresponding to each case re- 
Lation there is a lexical relation which points to typfcal.  f i l l e r s  of 
t h a t  ca le s lo t .  Thc lexical entry for  bake2 includes TLOC ki tchen.  It 
also i h c l u d e s ~  T make where T 1s the  well-known taxonomy r e l a t i o n ,  so t h a t

apn'rt can a l s o  be expressed compactly using t h e  T r e l a t i o n .  We a l s o  
need t o  make d e d u c t i ~ n s  from main verbs i n  predica te  complemhnt con- 
s t ruc t ions ,  deduetions such ag t he  speaker 's  view of t h e  t r u t h  of the  
proposition stated i n  the complement as derived from t h e  f a c t i v i t y  of 
the  verb. I n  order t o  answer several  questions from t h e  test  c i t e d  
above the r e a d e r  must infer t h a t  everything t h a t  Mother says is  t rue .  
~ e x i c a l  e n t r i e s  f o r  main verbs t h a t  take  predica te  complements contakn 
pointers  t o  the  implicat ion c lgss .  These r e l a t i o h s  can then be expanded 
t o  give t h e  proper axioms. 
The lexicon includes separa te  e n t r i e s  f o r  each derived form u n l e s s  
the root can be i d e n t i f i e d  by a simple suffix-chopp-tng rout ine .  Lexical  
r e l a t i o n s  are useful ,  he re  too i n  saving space. The l e x i c a l  en t ry  f o r

2. DESIGN ~JECISIONS 
The lexicbn i n  t h i s  system must make information r e a d i l y  available 
fo r  parsing,  f o r  bu i ld ing  the  s t o r y  model, and for making in fe rences  
during quest ion answerivg . So t h  knowledge about words and knowledge about 
the world must b e  s to red  i n  a compact b u t  immedrlately access ib le  form. 
Therefore, many dec is ions  must be made concerning t h e  design of the lexi- 
con The problems involved i n c l u d ~  the  asganiza t ian  of l e x i c a l  and ency- 
c lopedic  i.nformation, the chotce of a  lexdcal  model and the  determ3nafion 
of appropr ia te  s e r a n t i c  primes, t h e  representa t ion  of s e l e c t i o n  prefer- 
ences, t he  recogni t ion and s to rage  of homographs, and t h e  criteria f o r  
e s t a b l i s h i n g  sepa ra te  e n t r i e s  for idioms and o the r  f ixed phrases. Th i s

needed t o  support these  sepdrate funct ions  o r  whether a s i n g l e  u n i f i e d  
~ l o b a l  datq-base is better. Trad i t iona l ly  human b e j n f s  have used two 
separate stores of inf orma tlon, the dic t ioqary  and t he  encycl opedia. 
Some linguistic and computational mode1.s of language have also been 
based on the  assumption t h z t  informat ion about words should b e  s t o r e d  
i n  t w o  separate co1 l e c t i a n s .  
Ln Chomsky's f l ~ p p ~ t o  m o d e l  (1965) the re  are two separate storage 
plzcc .; for lexical Informztf o n ,  one in t he  base component 2nd another  i n

' dictionary" and semantic inf omat ion  in  an ' encyclopedia" Winograd 
(1971) has two separate word lists, one used by the parser and one by 
the semantic routines, even though the parslng and the semantic routgnes 
are very closely interwoven in his BLOCKS system 
Before deciding on whether to carry on this tradition one must ask 
whether there is really a clearcut d ~ s t i n c t i - o n  between these two klnds 
of lexical information Is there a simple algorltnm for deciding which 
data should go where? 
B z e m ,  Bzemzsch, mefer ,  and the Smantzc Funct ton of the Lpxzcon 
Both the dictionary and the encyclopedia are ways of  recording in- 
formation stored i n  human memory But human memory n s  probably not orga- 
nized i n  the usual graphic form of an alphabetic word l ist ,  therefore 
alternative memory s-tructures should be examlned One such a l ternat~ve  
has been presented by Bierman (1964) In h i s  system lexical-semantic 
f ie lds  &re prlmary, they define the bas ic  organization of semantic In- 
formation The function of the lexicon, if it has one 4x1 the semantic 
domain, i s  to  index thebe fields, t o  store pointers to the locat ion of 
a word In t h e  varlous f i e l d s  containing it An appropr:iate image f o r  
such a system is a very large single page d ic t ionazy  with Language speci- 
f l c  nodes connected by semantic relations (See a l s o  Werner 1969) 
Can the dictionary and the encyclopedia be distmguished i n  this 
context? Bierwisch and Kiefer (1970) assume that both kinds of informa- 
t ion are contained i n  the same lexical entry The distinction between 
lexical and encyclopedic knowledge corregponds then to the  dffference 
between the care and the periphery of a lexical entry, where 
The core o f , a  l e x i c a l  reading copprises a l l  and only 
those semantic spec i f ica t ions  t h a t  determine, roughly 
speaking, its place within  thb  system of d ic t ionary  
e n t r i e s ,  i. e. del jmit  i t  from other  (non-synonymous') 
e n t r i e s .  The periphez-8 conels ts  of those m a n t i c  
spec i f i ca t ions  whikh could be removed from i ts  reaaing 
withour changing its r e l a t i o n  t c  other  l e x i c a l  readings 
wi thin  the  same grammar (2bid: 69-70) 
Unfortunately they do not  speqify whether the lexical-gemanttc r e l a t i o n s  
which form the  s t r u c t u r e  of the  f i e l d s  are p a r t  of the  core o r  t h e  peri-  
The major d i f f i c u l t y  with this crikerion i s  its i n s t a b i l i t y .  A s  new

enrry from another may have go be s h i f t e d  from the  periphery t o  t h e  core 
--and thus from t h e  encyclopedia t o  the  lexicop. For ins tance,  s b ~ p o s e  a 
new entry,  "2eopard--a l a r g e ,  wild cat"  is  t o  be added. The e n t i r e  lexicon 
must be ~ear 'ched f o r  e n t r i e s  which mention large w i l d  cass.  I f  one i s  
found, s a y  "lion--a l a r g e  wlld cat" ,  then enough information must be added 
t o  both d e f i n i t i o n s  t o  d i f f e r e n t i a t e  leopard and z w f l  from each other. 
Soviet Lexicography and the Lmical Universe. 
Apresyan, iolkovsky, and  el ' Zuk run i n t o  the  same d i f f i c u l t y  of dis-

The main themes d e a l t  wi th  under the  heading ' l e x i c a l

phases of Co; 3) t y p i c a l  s i t u a t i o n s  occurring %efore  o r  
a f t e r  Co etc. Thus, t h e  sec t ion  l e x i c a l  universe f o r  t h e  
ward skis consis-ts of a l i a t  of the  types of s k i s  (racing, 
mountain, jumping, hunting), t h e i r  main p a r t s  ( s k i s  prdper 
and bindings), the  main objec ts  and ac t ions  necessary 2o.r 
the  c o r r e c t  use  (explo i ta t ibn)  of s k i s  ( s t i c k s ,  grease, $0 
WLZE), the  main types of a c t i J i t i e s  connected wi th  skis (a 
s k i - t r i p ,  a ski-race . . . I  and so on. Even these  scan*yt 
examples make it  c l e a r  t h a t  t h e  information about the l ex i -  
c a l  universe is, a t  l e a s t  p a r t i a l l y ,  of an eneyclopaedic 
nature. W e  say "partZallyl '  because genuine encyclopaedic 
information about skis ( t h e i r  h i s to ry ,  t he  way 
they are manufactured, etc.) is not supplied 
hgre: t h e  sec t ions  contain only such words and 
phrases as are necessary f o r  ta lk ing  on the  t o p i c ,  
and nothing else .  (1970:19,) 
The problem here is that "what is needed f o r  ta lk ing  about the  toqic" 
hepends very much on who i s  going to  do the  talking.  The de f in i t i on  
of slEi i n  Webster 's Nm tntemationaZ (2nd Edition) begins : 
One of a pa i r  of narrow s t r i p s  of wood, 
metal, o r  p l a s t i c ,  usually i n  conibinatian, 
bound one on each foot  and used fox gl iding 
over a snow-covered surface. 
Apresyan, iolkovsky, and Me1 cuk do not provide fo r  three of the items, 
mentioned here: what sk is  a r e  made of (wood, p l a s t i c ,  or metal) ,  what 
shape they come i n  (long and narrow) and where they belong s p a t i a l l y  
(on the  f e e t ) .  Yet these items could be e s sen t i a l  i n  understanding in- 
ferences i n  a story.  
It was snowing, Jim took out  h i s  skis. 
H e  waxed the wooden s t r ips . . . .  
You could need t h i s  information i n  answering questions. 
Jim s k i d  down the  mountain.... 
What was he wearing on h i s  f e e t :  
s l i ppe r s  s k i s  skates? 
Although i n  English o r  Russian i t  i s  poss ib le  t o  refer t o  s k i s  without 
knowing t h a t  they are  long and narrow, i t  is not possible  i n  Navajo where 
physical shapes determine verb forme. While the  entry i n  Webster's goes 
on a t  length beyond the  sentence given above, it does not include a l l  
V 
the i t e m s  which Apresyan, Zolkovsky, dhd Mel'guk mention. This, however, 
is not  surprising; the boundaries o f  t he  l e x i c a l  universe are not w e l l  
def  lned . 
Difficulties in updating a system with separate dictionary and encyclopedia, 
This lack of definition cahses tremepdous problem in a dynamic system. 
A "real" d ic t ionary  ar encyclopedia, the  one i n  a person's b r a in ,  is 
cons tan t ly  changing. I n f o m a t i o n  is  added, correc ted ,  apd perhaps l o s t .  
A truly i n t e r e s t i n g  memorymodel must be dynamic. T h e  problems of updating 
t h i s  information are no t  easy t o  so lve ,  t h e  problem of d i s t i ngu i sh ing  be- 
tween d ic t ionary  and encyclopedic i n f ~ m i a t i o n  i n  t h e  updating process 
seems insuperable,  
Recognizing d e f i n i t i o n s  phrased i n  o rd inmy  English is already,  d i f f i  
cult (Bferwisch and Rie fe r  1970, Lawler 1972). Determhing the  r e l i a b i l i t y  
of such fnfornat ion is a l s o  a problem and t h e  dichotomy of d i c t i ona ry  and 
eacyclop&dia inc reases  t h i s  d i f f i c u l t y .  Unfortunately i n f ~ r m a t i o n  does 
pot cpme nea t ly  packaged and marked "for  the  dict30nary1' o r  " f o r  the en- 
cyc loped~a" .  And add i t i on  of ififormation t o  one p a r t  of the e n t r y  may 
n e c e s s i t a t e  updating 'other  p a r t s  of th-e ent ry .  For example, i f  w e  l e a r n  
t h a t  record is a verb as well as a noun we need t o  add morphological in- 
formation, l e sc r ibe  the r e l a t i sons  between record and write, and we should # 
probably describe recording materials. Mention must be made t h a t  record 
is  a f a c t i t v ,  i . e ,  i f  someone records  tha t  something happened, one can 
assume t h a t  from t h e  s tandpoint  of  t h e  speaker t h e  something r e a l l y  d id  
happen. Whi~h  of t h i s  information is d i c t i o n a ~ y  information and which is 
encyclopedicf And once this dec i s ion  is made, information added to t h a t

The wrk of Kiparsky and Kiparsky (1970) , Lakof f (1971) and KcCdwley, 
(1968) has shown t h a t  syntax and semantics cannot be separated i n t o  such 
neat  compartments. But i f  syntax and semantics a r e  interwoven then does 
i t  make sense t o  put s y n t a c t i c  information i n  one box and semadtic informa-

We accept the generative semantikist arguments that syntax a d  seman-

inbrmat ion .  Furthermore, as shown above the re  seem t o  be no p r a c t i c a l

b. Lex{eaZ Models - ComponentiaZ Feature AnaZysis vs. ReZationaZ Netr~orFs. 
A second c r i t i c a l l y  important decis ion involves t h e  choice  of an 
appropria te  l e x i c a l  model, t h e  determination of what semantic primes t o  
use and how they should b e  combined i n  l e x i c a l  senant ic  s t r u c t u r e s .  Two 
importarit competing models a're provided by componential f e a t u r e  ana lys i s  
and by r e l a t i o n a l  networks. I n  a componential ana lys i s  model the p r i m e s  
are semantic features and words are deffried by bundles of features. This 
is a n a t u r a l  extension of t h e  d j  ~ i n c t i v e  feature approach t o  phoneme 
descr ip t ion  which h$~;  been used to explain  many phonological phenomena. 
Certain p r a c t i c a l  problems a r i s e .  The number of words i n  any 1anguage'Fs 
far l a r g e r  than t h e  number of phonemes. The number of d i s t i n c t i v e  fea- 
t u res  which serve t o  d i s c r j h i n a t e  them must be  l a r g e r  too. The word- 
semantic feature matrix f o r  a given language would be v a s t l y  l a r g e r  than

ih t roduce d i f f i c u l t i e s  i n  a computerized model. For tunate ly ,  both  numeric 
c31 ana lys i s  and document r e t r i q v a l  o f f e t  experience i n  handling immense

c l o s e  t o  Katz 's  proposal  (1966). 
Ip a r e l a t z a n a l  network model, however, t h e  primes are r e l a t i o n s  and 
words o r  word senses.  Rela t ions  connect w'osds together  i n  a network i n  
wnlch the woPds a r e  nodes and t h e  r e l a t i o n s  a r e  edges. In f a c t ,  wo.rds,are 
defined i n  terms of t h e i r  r e l a t i onsh ips  t o  o the r  words. 
These *models d i f f e r  r a d i c a l l y  i n  t h e i r  approach t o  t h e  c r i t i c a l  Lexi- 
c a l  t a s k  p f  f ind ing  r e l a t e d  words. I n  t h e  componential a n a l y s i s  model re- 
l a t e d  words share  r e l a t e d  f ea tu re s .  Prl~.;umably, t h e  more f e a t u r e s  two 
words share  the  more c lo se ly  r e l a t e d  khey a r e .  Thus, some kind of c l u s t e r  
a n a l y s i s  must be  used t o  i d e n t i f y  r e l a t e d  worgs. I n  t h e  r e l a t i o n a l  network 
model the lexicon i s  Eormed from 2eTatfionships between words. Thus relatl ed 
words a r e  immedzately ava i l ab l e  
Both models, componential and r e l a t i o n a l ,  r e q u i r e  a search  f o r  semanric 
primes The componential ana lys i s  model r equ i r e s  t h e  discovery of poss ibly

number of rekvant r e l a t i o n s  i s  probably q u i t e  small. Zolkovsky and

The componential a n a l y s i s  model makes it poss ib l e  t o  d e f i n e  d i s -

I n  t h e  r e l a t i o n a l  network model r ~ l a t e d  words a r e  easy t o  f i n d ,  but  
the boundaries of semantic f i e l d 5  are extremely fuzzy and i n d i s t i n c t .  A 
semantic f i e l d  can be def ined by s t a r t i n g  a t  a p a r t i c u l a r  node and going 
a given number of s t e p s  i n  any d i r e c t i o n .  The semantic f i e l d s  obta ined 
i b i s  way, however, have very a r b  J t rary boundaries and overJap considerably . 
Certain b a s h  philosophical -psycho1 ogical assumptions may create 
a strong bias for one of  these models over the other. Someone who 
bel ieves  that semantic features exist as Platonic ideals or who accepts 
them as psychological rea l i t i e s  may easily find componential analysis 
a most natural kind of description and regard the necessary search for 
features or sememes as highly relevant. Someone who Feels that "There 
is  no thought without words" would be much mre likely to prefer a re- 
lational network description. A lexicon 2 8 ,  in an important sense, a 
memory model. Intuitio'i  abbut our own internal memory models must 
have a strong influence on the lexicon w e  s h a ~ e .  
We have chosen a relational  network model for both in t f i i t i ve  and 
practical reasons. We find lexical-semantic re la t ions  theoretically 
interesting (see Evens et al ms), Useful mventorles of thesd re- 
lations are available, i n  a later section we describe some of these 
sources. As will be show they proviae a convenient way of s to r ing  
axiom schemes far deductive inference. 
A s  l ex ica l  semantic structures @e use the same first-order pre- 
dicate calculus notation in which semantic representations a r e  written 
in the que9tion-answering system - meanings of words and meanings of 
s e n t e n c ~ s  must have the  same underlyjng form As McCawley (1970) has  
argued "denyist" and "doctor who creats teeth" must contain the same 
u n i t s  o f  mehnlng t i e d  together i n  the same %ray 
c "'e Zectzqn Preferences 
A third important problem to be faced in constructing a lexicon 
which is to support a parser is the prnhl~rn nf se lect ion  restrictions. 
Chomsky (1965) developed the theory of se lec t ion  r e s t r i c t i o n s  i n  order 
t o  block the  generation of nonsense sentences i n  the syn tac t i c  com- 
ponent of h i s  model, The l ex i ca l  entry f o r  frzghten, f o r  examae, 
contains the information that i t  requires  as object a noun with the featur 
[+animate] , while drznk requlres  an animate subject  . I f  these condit ions 
a r e  not met, generation is blocked. Select ional  restr ictr ions seem much 
too r e s t r i c t i v e .  Traller trucks drink diesel f u e l  and the earth dr inks  
i n  the ra in .  In  describing dreams w e  can invent pe r fec t ly  appropriate  
sentences i n  which inanimate objects  by the  dozens ge t  up, run around, 
and dr ink  u n t j l  frightened back t o  place. S t i l l  it is %rue t h a t  sen- 
tences l i k e  these are somehow more surpr i s ing  than sentences i n  which 
cows dr ink  from a brook and a r e  frightened by l ighthing.  We need some 
method ~f recording the ordinary, everyday ways i n  which words combine 
w ~ t h o u t  excluding the  unusual, the  poet ic ,  t he  nletaphoric uses, We 
k i l l  c a l l  them seZectzonprefe~ences instead of se lec t ion  restrictions. 
Some truly semantic means of ident i fy ing semantic anomalies a r e  
needed. Raphael mentions t h i s  question r a the r  casual ly ,  almost as an 
as ide  i n  the SIR paper. He draws taxonomic t rees ,  one fo r  t h e  nouns 
and one fo r  t he  verbs, from the  vocabulary of a first grade reader. 
Then he makes statements l i k e  t h i s  
1. Any noun below node 1 is a s u i t a b l e  subject fo r  
any verb below node 1'. 
2.  Only nouns below nodes 3 o r  4 may be subjects fo r  
verbe below node 3'. (1968, p. 51) 
H e  makes it c lea r  that he i s  indeed t ry ing  to  solve t he  s e l ec t i ona l  
problem 
The complete model cohlposed of tree structures 
and statements abodt their possible connectionp, 
is a representation for the class o f  a l l  pos- 
s i b l e  events. In other words, i t  represents 
the computer's knowledge of the world. We now 
have a mechanism for testing the ' coherence' or 
'meaningfulness' of new samples of text.  (1968, p.  51) 
Werner (1972) has suggested a method for handling the se lect lonal  prob- 
l e m  which uses noun taxonomies i n  very much the same way that Raphael does. 
H i s  proposal includes an elegant way of storing s e l e ~ t i o n a l  information 
within h i s  memory model. In his network model, noun phrase arguments are 
connected t o  the verb by prepositions. The node representing the lexical 
entry f o r  the verb has arcs connecting i t  to compound nodes, one for each 
prepwi t ion  which can be  used with the verb. The object  of each prepo- 
s i t i o n  i s  a node i n  the noun taxonomy. This noun or any noun below ft 
i n  the taxonomy may serve as an argument for the verb. Hem is an over- 
simplified example of  a network for saZ2. 
Figure 1: Werner's Ansyer t o  the Selection Problem 
This network says that oeZZ takes a human subject, a thing as 
object ,  the preposit-n to followed by a human, the preposition Jbr 
followed by money. The square brackets around [human] indicate that this 
is  just a pointer to  the top noun i n  the taxonomy for human beings. 
Any node i n  th i s  taxonomy below the node marked human, whether i t  i s  
S m  OK a Navajo or Mother, can be used as a subject for saZZ. He does 
not use the verb taxonomy as Raphael does. Each verb haa its own set 
of se lec t ion  indicators  
f n  h i s  discussion of the goals of a semantic theory Winogtad describes 
semantic markers and se lec t ion  r e s t r i c t i o n s  , quotes Katz and Fodor (1964) 
and indicates  tha t  he intends to  mbody t h i s  theory i n  h i s  system. But 
i n  fac t  semantic markers i n  the  BLOCKS program are derived from a marker 
t r e e  (Winograd, 1971, Figure 59) which is  organized taxonomically. In 
the implementation process Winograd seems t o  have moved from .a s t r i c t  
Katz-Chomsky posit ion t o  a posi t ion somewha1 c loser  t o  RaphaeJ. a J Werner. 
The Raphael and Werner proposals are the guiding pr inc ip les  here, 
ajapted t o  accmodate  case-defxned arguments. The lexlcal entry f o r  
mooel, the  i n t r a n s i t i v e  pave, must t e l l  us  about se lec t ion  as w e l l  as how 
to r e l a t e s u b j e c t ,  object ,  and preposi t ional  phrases t o  cases. The in- 
formation is organized t h i s  way: 
gramnutical function case frame selection i n f a r a t i o n  
1. subject  &per fencer thing 
move1 # 2. from source thing,  place 
3, to, into, onto goal thing,  place 
The numbers 1, 2 ,  3 ,  indicate argdment positions for t h e  predicate c a l ~ u l d ~  
representat ion.  The next column lists the grammatical function. Next 
come dase indicat ions.  Last comes the  se l ec t ion  information, the top 
node i n  the relevant  p a r t  of the  taxonomy. For move1 the subject i s  an 
experiencer. The source i s  usual ly  marked by t h e  prepositaon f m m .  The 
g o d  is  lrirually marked by a preposit ion l i k e  to, into, br onto. The 
se lec t ion  information in column four is  r a t h e r  du l l ,  since any argument 
can be a physical argument o r  thzw, t he  source and goal can both b e  
places.  There is a rule t h a t  any physical  goal  can be replaced by a 
c l a s s  of adverbs containing back and there, s o  these  a l t e r n a t i v e s  do 
not  have t o  be l i s t e d ,  
An at tempt i s  being made t o  u s e  the  verb taxorlomy as Raphgel 
suggested. In  t h i s  lexicon go is  marked a s  taxonomically r e l a t e d  to  
move. The en t ry  f o r  go does not  contain  the  information l a b e l l e d  # 
above. Ins tead,  when t h i s  information is  needed, the look-up r o u t i n e  
climbs t h e  taxonomic t r e e  i n  t h e  lexicon u n t i l  i t  f i n d s  a verb which 
has this information and oopies i t  from t h a t  entry .  Thus i t  gets,case- 
argument and s e l e c t i o n a l  information fo r  go from the  en t ry  f o r  move. 
It is  not  c l e a r  y e t  whether t h i s  w i l l  r e a l l y  work with a s i z a b l e  vo- 
cabulary. 
This selec t i o n a l  informa t i o n  is t r ea ted  as  s e l e c  t f o n  preference 
and not  s e l e c t i o n  r e s t r i c t i o n .  Each candidate  word sense f o r  a verb i s  
checked f o r  s e l e c t i o n a l  prefbrence. I f  no arrangement of t h e  avail- 
able noun phrase arguments 1s c o n s i s t e n t  with these  preferences another  
word senqe is  examined But i f  a l l  word sensee have been r e j e c t e d  on 
the  basis of s e l e c t i o n a l  information, t h e  sentence is not  rejected 
Instead w e  look again a t  the candidate  word senses  and count for ~ a c h  one 
t h e  number of qteps  up the tzxonomic t r e e  w e  have t o  make t o m r e s o l v e  
the  c o n f l i c t .  The word-sensf which requires t h e  fewest s t e p s  I s  ~ h d s e n .  
The hope is tHat t h e  system will be a b l e  t o  "understand" simple metaphors 
t h i s  way. It would be i n t e r e s t i n g  t o  t r y  t o  c r e a t e  metaphors by picking 
noun phrase arpuments c l a w  t o  but: n o t  u n d t r  the nodcs I n d i c i t t d  by the

d.  The Amonm-PoZyeemy Problm - Cr$te&a for Separate Entriee. 
Words with the same phyeical shape bu t  dgffprent meanings constant ly  
cause t rouble  in  na tu ra l  language processing. In  designing a lexicon we  
must decide whether o r  not t o  c r ea t e  a separate ent ry  f o r  each v a r i a t i o n  
t meaning aid type of use. Qui l l ian  is pa r t i cu l a r ly  i n t e r e s t ed  i n  words 
w'ith mul t ip le  meafiings and he experimented with tseveral i n  h i s  memory 
model. In Qui l l ian  (1968) the word ptmt is  treated as a three-way homo- 
nym with three separate ttrpe nodes, each with a separa te  defini t ion-plane:  
PLANT Living s t r u c t u r e  which is not  ah animal, 
f requently with leaves, g e t t i n g  its food 
from air,  water, earth. 
PUNT2 Apparatus used fo r  any process i n  industry. 
W T 3  Pu t  (seed, p lan t ,  etc.) i n  e a x h  f o r  growth. 
The type node f o r  the  first forms a d i s junc t ive  set with token nodes 
pointing t o  the other two 
The word food has a s i n g l e  d e f i n i t i o n  wi th  a l t e r n a t i v e  formulations: 
That which J iv ing  being has t o  take i n  t o  keep it 
l i v i n g  and for  growth. Things f omllng meals, 
espec ia l ly  o ther  than dklnk. 
A polysemous word l i k e  t h i s  has a s i n g l e  type node and a s i n g l e  de f in i t i on -  
plane, but  t he  two a l t e r n a t i v e  de f in i t i ons  a r e  combined with an OR l i n k .  
r/ Apresyan, Me1 'guk and ZolkovsQ a t  tack the  homonymy-polysemy problem 
with vigor .  Graphically coincident worda a r e  considered homonyms, given 
d i s t i n c t i v e  supersc r ip t s  and l i s t e d  as separa teeen t r ies ,  i f  t h e i r  d e f i n i t i o n s  
V 
"hiive no common part"  (Apresyan, Zolkovsky and ~ e l ' g u k  1970:3) They do 
not  define "a common part," but they do give an example. KOCA (scythe), 
2 3 
KOCA (braid of hair) ,  KOCA ( sp i t ) .  If two gefinitibns have a single 
common par t ,  t h e  word is classified as polysemantic with a single entry 
divided in to  separate  par t s .  They dis t inguish  two types of polysemy. Ifi 
one case the difference between two words i s  regular .  The r e l a t i o n  of a 
verb t o  i ts typical ob J ect is  such a regular meaning change, e. q. record (v) 
- record(n) , f ieh(v) - f i sh(n)  , and aid(v) - a i d  (n) . ghese regular vari- 
ations i n  meaning a r e  numbered with Arabic numerals, while irreguldr vari- 
ations are numbered with Roman numerals. Thus part 3 o f  t he  l e x i c a l  entry  
f o r  bm, the de f in i t ion ,  might have the form: 
bod XC 1. To bend t h e  head i n  assent o r  r e v e ~ e n c e .  (vt) 
2. To submit o r  yreld.  (vi)  
3 .  TO cause t o  bend. (vt )  
a 
4. An incl inacibn of the head. (n) 
5. A bent amplement used t o  propel an arrow 
o r  play a stringed mstrument. (n) 
I .  1. The forward part of a boat.  (n) 
2. One who rows in the bow of a boat. (n) 
There seems t o  be some redundancy between definition-elements and the 
lexical functions. Shouldn't regular  va r i a t ions  i n  meaning be captured 
by fegular lex ical  fllnctions? If so,  then the distinction Apresyan, 
u? 
Zolkovsky and ~el'fuk make between regular and irregular meaning variations 
w i l l  be appareht from the form and need not h e i n d i c a t e d  by different  no- 
tation, such as Arabic and Roman numerals. 
For convenience i n  lexical lookup we have a single physical ent ry  
for each grapUcal form. Each word sense whether irregular or regular 
is numbered separate ly  with Arabic numerals. Thus the  a d ~ e c t i v e  is  coozl, 
coo22 i$ t he  verb t o  become coozl, a d  cod3 is the  verb meaning t o  cause 
t o  become cooll. Separate information aboub. l e x i c a l  r e l a t i ~ n s ,  etc. is 
stored f o r  each subentry.

Some c r i t e r l a  must be es tabl ished f o r  deciding which idioms deserve separa te  
l e x i c a l  erntries and how multi-word phrases should be s tored.  
When does an idiom deserve t o  be t r ea ted  as a separate  Lexical unlt? 
v 
Apresyan, Zolkovsky, and  el' Euk (1970) and Klparsky (1979) represent  
oppbsfte poles of opinion here. I n  the  explanatory-combinatory dictionary 
(ECF) of t h e  Soviets word combinat i~ns  which have a d e f i n i t i o n  of t h e i r  
own o r  "a pecullar  'combinability pattern" have separate  e n t r i e s .  Kiparsky 
(1975) considers an idiom as a separate l e x i c a l  u q i t  only i f  i t  invoxves

and "come h e l l  or  high water" are treated be u n i t s ,  but "make headway" i s  
no't. Instead headmy is defxned as "progress" and marked as appearing

and bz~thday cake a r e  separate ly  defined, although t h l s  is c e r t a i n l y  a 
productive partuof English. 
J u d i t h  Levi (1974, 1975) has proposed a theore t i ca l ly  elegant  and 
i n t u i t i v e l y  a t t r a c t i v e  method of generating these  forms. According t o  
Levi t h e  underlying structure f o r  "birthday boy" i s  "boy-have-b5rthday" 
and the underlying s truc t p r e  for  "Sir thday cake" is "cake-for-bir thday . tl 
Then under c e r t a i n  conditions h e ,  for, etc. can be deleted t o  give us 
t h e  noun adjunct expressions. Given these ru le s ,  she argues, i t  is not 
necessary t o  treat these exptessions acCl separate  lexical items. While her 
rules seem sufficient t o  allow us t o  syntheeiize these compounds c o r r e c t l y ,  
difficlClJties a r i s e  when we t r y  to  use them for analys i s .  The question- 
answering system needs t o  be able t o  infer from "birthday boy" that t h e  
boy i n  question is having a birthday, but t o  avoid inferr ing from "birthday 
cake" t h a t  the  cake is having a bir thday.  For correct  recognit ion w e  need 
t o  be able t o  recover the  qnique underlying stl 'ucture i f  one exists. (For 
a similar criticism see Downing 1977 : 814-15. ) Levi' s theory accounts for 
the generation of new noun-noun compounds. However, i n  order t o  pcrount 
fo r  the recognit ion process we need l e x i c a l  entries for f a ~ p i l i a r  f ixed com- 
pounds and her theory t o  analyze new compounds. We have used Le+iVs struc- 
ture as a basis for our representat ion of  omp pound nouns. 
Noun-noun colppounds have separate en t r i e s .  A birthday cake is treated 
as "a cake f o r  a birthday." A ball gme is represented as "a game that has 
a ball". A piggy bank 1 s  deflned as "a bank t h a t  i s  a pj g. I t  
The system i s  t o l d  that Jim has a piggy bank and asked what the bank 
looks l ike .  It could be argued tha t  anyone with s u f f i c i e n t  c u l t u r a l  know- 
ledge ought t o  be able t o  answer t h i s  even i f  a l l  the  banks i n  his past  
were shaped like bee-hives, but  w e  need a place t o  write down this c u l t u r a l  
encyclopeaic knowledge and a l e x i c a l  entry f o r  piggy bank seems l i k e  a good 
place to put it. 
Becker i n  hie wrk on "The Phrasal Lexicon" (1975) has produced 
evidence on the  Soviet s i d e  of t h i s  argument, H i s  data  suggest t h a t  
f h e d  phrases comprise approximately ha l f  of our spoken output  and have 
an independent lexical existewe. He includes i n  h i s  lexicon euphemisms 
("the o ldes t  profession") , phrasal  c o n s t r a i n t r  ('8y i""" sheer  coincidence"), 
d e i c t i c  locut ions  ("for t h a t  matter"), sentence bui lders  (" (person A) 
gave (person B) a loag song and dance about (a topic)'!), s i t u a t i o n a l  
ut terances ("HOW can I ever repay yau?") , and verbatim t e x t s  (proverbs, 
song titles, etc .) . He claims t h a t  
we speak mostly .by s t i t c h i n g  together bswatcbs of 
t e x t  that w e  have heard before; productive processes 
have t h e  secondary r o l e  of adapting t h e  old phrases 
t o  the  new situation.. . .most u t te rances  a r e  produced 
i n  s t e ~ e  k yped s o c i a l  s i t u a t i o n s ,  where t he  c o m n i -  
ca t ive  and r i t u a l i s t i c  functions of languagg demand 
not novelty, but  r a the r  an appropr ia te  combination 
of formulas, c l ichea,  idioms, a l lus ions ,  slogans. . . 
(1975 : 60) 
He  has col lected 25,000 phrases f o r  t h e  phrasal  lexicon. 
Catherinq Flournoy (1975) has found severa l  hundred f ixed phrases 
i n  d computer scudy of Father Coughlin's speeches. This is  not a new 
idea t o  students of o r a l  epic poetry. Homer constant ly  used f ixed phrases 
t o  f i t  syn tac t i c  and met r ica l  s l o t s .  Dawn is always "rosy-tingered"; 
Hector is constantly " ta i l  Hector of t h e  shining helm. II  
There is  a ser ious  space-time tradeoff  here  between parsing time 
and lexical storage space. It is probably t r u e  t h a t  people possess and 
constant ly  use a phrasal lexicon. Whether we should use atorage space 
for items whieh we can parse/produce without ambiguity is another question. 
Currently we provide separate e n t r i e s  for  any phrase that we cannot 
parse and i n t e r p r e t  co r r ec t ly  from the  e n t r i e s  f o r  individual words. Briaf 
entries f o r  these phrases seem absolute ly  necessaty f o r  any prwtacal re- 
cognit ion scheme. These entries a l s o  seem t o  be the appropriate  place for 
indexing pointers  t o  t h e  c u l t u r a l  i n ?  ormation necessary b r  mWog ifif er- 
ences and answering question6 about b i r thday cakes and b i r t h d a y  parties. 
There are  theoretical arguments f o r  such entries as well. We believe, as 
Becker does, i n  the  phrasal  lexicon, although we do no t  Pnslude entries 
f o r  any phrases tha t  can be parsed and in te rpre ted  correttly without a 
separa te  entry. Any complete system for language proceestng must a l s o ,  
o f  course, contain r u l e s  l i k e  Levi 's  t o  providg an a b i l i t y  t o  process 
novel forms. 
f . Prelhznary Design Deczsions for  the Lex{con. 
The goal of t h i s  project is a lexicon suf f i c i e a t  f o r  pars ing,  forming 
semantic representat ions,  and making inferences,  c o q a c  t but  s t i l l  a l I0~4.ng 
rapid l e x i c a l  lookup. 
The lexicon is a data-base f o r  the question-answering system, 
a combination lexicon-encyclopedia . Syntact ic  aad semantdc inf  o b  t i o n  
are combined i h  the  same lexical  enrries. Lexical  semanttc represen ta t ions  
are m i t t e n  i n  the same form as the  semantic representa t ions  for sentenced, 
i n  a many-tiorted. f i r s t  order  p red ica te  calculus.  Homographs w3ich vary 
i n  meaning or use a r e  d i f f e r e n t i a t e d  by Arabic numetal subscr ip ts .  Separate 
entries are included f o r  phras es with fixed meaning. 
The lexicon is organized In terms of l e x i c a l  r e l a t i o n s .  Semantic f i e l d s  
defined by r e l a t i o n s  are used t o  handle prablems of ambiguity and context. 
The relations are used to  express and retrieve plany d i f  f erem kzncls 
informaticn, from past participles t o  selection preferences t o  proper 
habjtats for l i ons .  Thus the system of l ex ica l  relations is crucial to  
representation, retrieval, and inferance. 
3.  s O M ~  THEORIES OF LEItgcat RELATIONS 
While developing our lexical relations we examined a variety of 
relational theories in anthropology and lingui st ice and even col lected 
folk defilpitions of our own (Evens 1975) . We have been parrlcularly 
influenced by the anthropological fieldwork of Casagrande and Hale (1967) 
by the memory models of Raphael (1968) and Werner (19741, and most of all 
by the ECD of Apresyan, Me1 cuk, and Zolkovsky (1970). But we looked at  
each of these relational theories from t h e  peaaliar point crf view o f  corn 
put er ques tion-answering and the pal-titular lexical environment of ch i l -  
dren's stories, adding and discarding relations to  fit the problem. 
Cdsagmnde mrd Bale - L&caZ RejSations in FoZk Definitions. 
Casagrande and Hale (1967) collected 800 Papago folk-defini*tions 
and sorted them into groups on the basis bf  semantic and grammatical 
similarities.  They produced the following list of thirteen lexical re- 
lations.  (Table 1)

Casagrande and Bale make no claim t ha t  they have found aW poss fb le  
l e x i c a l  r e l a t i o p s .  These d e f i n i t i o n s  were co l l ek ted  as part  h f  a s tudy 
of d i a l e c t  variat ion i n  Papago and Pima, The wolds t o  be defined were 
chosen because they n i g h t  e x h i b i t  dlal-ect d i f f e m n c e s  and n o t  t o  e l i d t

some word assoclation pairs which do wt have exact  analogues i n  the 
Papago d e f i n i t i o n s .  These are "cootdinate" p a i r s  like "needle-thread" 
or "bread-butter", "clang" responses like "table-stable" , or  sequential 
responses 'bish-bone" and " w h i s t l e - s t ~ ~ ~ ~ .  'Phey remark about the 
bread-but ter p a i r  that t he  relationship involved between "bread" and 
"butter" is similar t o  tha t  discussed f o r  contingency, except that i n  
the Papago sample, the contingency relationship is not used if both X 
and Y are nominal concepts. hbs ter t s  CoZZegiate Dict io l l~(~~ does

Werner Is Lexica2 Re'lations. 
There are two ways to go from the study of fo lk  def in i t ions .  One 
way IS t o  find o r  invent l e x i c a l  re la t ions  to fit a l l  t h e  folk definl- 
t igns one can collect  in  a given language, and then look for more in. 
the formu1.a~ of published dic t ionar ies  of t h a t  lahguage. me other  is 
t o  abs t rac t  a minimal set of language-universal lexical-semantic relation1 
and then attempt to express other proposed lex ica l  relations i n  terms of 
the minimal set. Werner has made substantial  s t eps  i n  this second di-  
rection (Werner and Topper 1976). 
Werner's basic semantic re la t ions  are the taxonomic r e l a t i o n  (T) ,  
the modification or attribution re la t ion  (M) and the temporal sequencing 
re la t ion ,  queuing (Q) . These he calls "the basic  cement of the organi- 
zation of. c u l t u r a l  knowledge and memory. " (1974 : 173, 
'Ehe re1 at ion of taxonomy (T) ,  t he  one expressed i n  English by "a 
canary is a (kind of)  b i rd  , i s  written (bird) T (canary) and i s  re- 
presented in Wernerf s diagrams by a directed'arc labelled T. 
(bird)

The relation of modification or attribution (M), ?he one expressed 
in English by "the yellow bird" or "the b i r d  is yellow", i s  represented 
bp a directed arc label led  R. 
(bird) ; M b [yellow] 
These last  two djagrams can be combined to expresb the idea that a 
canary is a yellow bird.  
(bird) 
[ye l  low7 
(canary) 
The queuing relation Q represents the idea of order or sequence. 
For example, (Monday) Q (~uesday). This relation is fundamental in the 
representation of plans in Werner's memory model. " K m i n g  how. . .  re- 
quires the retention of temporal order. there are things t o  be done 
first, second, and so on and usually nonsense results if the order is 
changed (One can ' t drink t h e  beer before the b o t t l e  cap is  removed) ." 
( i b i d ,  p .  11) 
I '  Relations like ' ~ o n s i s t s  of, part o f , '  'cause of,' ' l i k e '  are 
handled as complex relations and composed from thr primitive relations 
M and T using the l o g i c a l  operators not  (-), and (a) or (v) and parti-  
cular lex3cal items. For the 'part of' relation he gives the example 
"the thumb is  a pa r t  of the hand" ( ib id ,  pp. 50, 51) 
o o f  [hand] 
-4 
o (thumb) 
This 'diagram es sen t i a l l y  says "the thumb is a (kind o f )  hand-part. I t  
This is an extremely elegant and general  theory. ~erner's claim 
of l i n g u i s t i c  un iversa l i ty  seems well-founded. His model is  m many 
ways i n t u i t i v e l y  agpealing although w e  a r e  not  convinced that our bas i c  
l e x i c a l  r e l a t i o n s  and our bas i c  semantic relations are the safne. 
Our decls ion t o  t r y  t o  design a lexicon with a larger set of l e x i c a l  
r e l a t i ons  i s  r e a l l y  an engineering decls ion,  based on two probably 
temporary practical d i f f i c u l t i e s .  
(i) W e  do not  know how to  prove theorems i n  
Werner's model. 
(ii) We bel ieve  t h a t  a variety of language speci- 
fic l e x i c a l  r e l a t i o n s  can produce a more com- 
pact  lexicon with more e f f i c i e n t  search 
rout ines .  
~aphael's Semantic Information Ret r ieval  program (1968) combined 
a semantic net representa t ion  with a relational calculys  whichpakes 
inference8 i n  t h i s  net .  S I R  inputs  s i m p h  English sentences,  trans- 
lates them i n t o  node-relation-node form, uses a r e l a t i o n a l  calculys  
t o  prove theorems, asks for more information, if needed, and answers 
questions using those inferences.  The r e h t i o n s  which Raphael used 
are: 
x ~ y  (An x is a y, e.g. A boy is a person.) 
x y ( x  is a y, e.g. John ie a person.) 
equ$v[x;y] (x and .y are two names for same thing. ) 
owng[x;y] (Every y owns an x.) 
own [x; y] (y owns an x. ) 
partg [ x ; y ]  (Some x is part of every y . )  
part [x;y] (An x is part of y. ) 
r i g h t  [r;y] ( x  is t o  the right of y.) 
jright [x;y] ( x B s  just to the right of y.) ( i b i d ,  p.  92) 
Each relation R has an inverse z. If aRb then the pair (R,b) i s  stored 
C 
on the property list of a and ( ~ , a )  i s  stored on the property l ist  of 
b.  For each relat ion there are axioms. Further axioms describe how 
fllfferent relations interact. For instance, the set Inclusi~n relation 
has the following properties:  
/r J [c] i . e . ,  set inclusion is  transit ive 
a ~ x A  x c y ~ a c y  
The interaction between set inclusion and partg is expressed by the 
axiom 
In other words, if an x i s  part of a y and a z is a y then an x is patt 
of o z. For example, if you know that mammals have hair and that whales 
are mammals, then you know that whales have hair. 
Some of Raphael's relations represent particnlar information, some 
represent generic information. It is the generic relations which cor- 
respond to the kind of lexical relations we are working with: set in- 
clusion, equiv, partg, and owng.

dprssgan, Zolkouskg, u d  Me$ '&k. 
The Explana tory-Combinator9 pic t ionary of Apr~syan , &el ' Zuk, and 
Q 
Zolko~sky (1970) contains a wide variety of l ex i ca l  re la t ions .  When- 
ever they not ice a l ex ica l  regular i ty ,  they invent a l e x i c a l  r e l a t l on  
to express i t .  Their paper contains about f i f t y  re la t ions  and they outline 
ways of combining the  given re la t ions  t o  ge t  still more. Many of these 
relations appear i n  an e a r l i e r  paper by Zolkovsky and Mel16uk, which em- 
phasizes the  importance of specifying the  grammatical transformations 
associgted with each l ex i ca l  pairing. Suppose a s to ry  says: 
The prince's g i f t  o f  a magic a p p l e  t o  Zamiya 
dismayed h i s  mother. 
Zn order t o  represent t h i s  correc t ly  or  answer a question l i k e  "What 
did the  prince give Zamiya?" the system needs t o  know not only t he  lexi -  
ca l  r e l a t i on  between give and gift but a l so  the transformation which 
ca r r i e s  one s t r i n g  into another. In t h i s  lexicm the  accompmying trans- 
formation w i l l  be indicated i n  the  l ex i ca l  entry f o r  the  r e l a t i on ,  not 
i n  the  l e x i c a l  entry f o r  t he  par t icular  words gi@e and g i f t .  
Most of the re la t ions  given i n  these two papers are a s  appropriate 
i n  English a s  i n  Russian. Some, although appropriate i n  English, embody 
more sophist icat ion than seems necessary i n  t h i s  p lo jec t .  The Soviet 
col lect ion of r e l a t v n s  i s  open-ended. They expect t o  iden t i fy  more 
i n  fur ther  lexicographical work and t o  discover fur ther  propert ies  of 
the  re la t ions  already ident i f ied .  This seems highly i n tu i t i ve .  It i s  
probably the case tha t  people go on expanding their reper to i res  of lexi- 
c a l  r e la t ions  and learning their propert ies  and tha t  t h i s  learning con- 
t inues t o  a much greater  age than the acquis i t ion  of syntax. Lexical 
r e l a t i o n s  can be added t o  our lexicon just by adding a l e x i c a l  en t ry  
f o r  t h e  r e l a t ion .  A t  t h i s  point  t h e  a c t u a l  addi t ion of e n t r i e s  can 
only be done by i n t e r n a l  manipulation. Eventually i t  would be preferable  
for t he  system tov"learn" such r e l a t i o n s  o r  a t  least accept them in Englieh 
form. The authors r e f e r  t o  t h e i r  r e l a t i o n s  a s  functions and t h e  examples 
are wr$tten i n  funct ional  notat ion:  Figur(passim)=f&me; Anti(beautifu1) 
= p Z a i n  ugly. Since these functions are definiteqy not single-valued, w e  
have used t he  term l e x i c a l  r e l a t i o n ,  i n  deference t o  the mathematical con- 
ventions. 
4 .  THE SET OF LEXICAL RELATION& 
The fesearch reviewed above and our own experience with children' s 
s t o r i e s  has l e d  us  t o  pos i t  nine major categor ies  of re la t ioa6 .  See 
Table 2. These categories  do not have any i n t e r n d l  s t r u c t u r e  as a s e t ;  
however many of t he  r e l a t i o n s  themselves seemed t o  share some comonality 
usually semantic, and so  it became na tu ra l  t o  group them i n t o  s e t s  of 
categories. Our category l ist  beglns with bhe more familiar and classicag 
r a l a t i o n s  of synonymy and faxonomy, apd presents  an expanded sub-catego* 
rization within antonmy. The grading category includes a somewhat aiverse 
co l lec t ion  of th ree  r e l a t i ons .  The a t t r i b u t e  r e l a t i o n s  and t h e  part-whole 
category seem firmly motivated. The next two categor ies  cons i s t  of co- 
occurrence o r  co l loca t iona l  r e l a t i ons .  The last twb groups of r e l a t i o n s  
are paradigmatic i n  nature, 
The set of r e l a t i o n s  presented here is  by no means complete, Indeed, 
i t  iq del iberate ly  open-ended. Whenever a new l e x i c a l  r e g u l a r i t y  i s  seen 
i n  the data ,  a new r e l a t i o n  i s  added. I n  order t o  make t h e  system of  re- 
l a t i o n s  extens ib le ,  theredwe, a separa te  lexical entry  has  been construc- 
ted fo r  each relation containing its spec i a l  p roper t i es  and associated 
axiom schemes. (Examples of  this appear below, f o r  example, i n  s ec t ion  d .

There are seve ra l  arguments f o r  t h i s  methodology. Pr imar i ly  we a r e  
convinced t h a t  lexical r e l a t ions  do not  constitute a f ixed  set of language* 
universal  semantic primes. We also feel  t h a t  we have not  y e t  discovered 
the most appropr ia te  o o l l e c t i o r  or our own use. I n  add i t i on  we hope t o

a. The CZassicaZ Re&zt$ons: Tuxcmomy and Synonymy. 
Ar i s to t l e  demanded tha t  every definition begin with t he  statemen5 
of t he  genus t o  which the  term belonged. The genus now is ca l l ed  a super- 
ordinate taxon and the  r e l a t i o h  between the  term and its germs is labe l led  
a s  the  taxonomy re la t ion .  Even today commerc%al lexicographers following 
the  c l a s s i c a l  t r ad i t i on  use taxonomy along with synonymy as t h e  funda- 
mental relatiuns. These r e l a t i o n s  a lso  'have played an easeneia l  pa r t  i n  
a t t e m p t s  a t  question-answering. I n  Raphael's (1968) system they appear 
a s  s e t  inclusion and equivalence. In Simmnns@(l973) system they are 
called IMPIY snd EQ. The inference-makfng scheme i n  Marx's question- 
answering system is based on these two r e l a t i ons ,  For eample, one of 
his test paragraphs says that a dog is brown and the question asks, "14 
t he  aaimal brown?" (Man 1972:224 ) .  A dic t ionary  lookup of dog finds 
the taxonomic re la t ionship  between dbg and mimaz. AnimaZ is subs titu- 
ted fo r  dog and the  two sides match. Marx uses synonyqy i n  t h e  same way. 
Suppose t he  text  says "John wants money" and a question asks "Does 
John desire money?" (P972:229). A dictionary lookup finds tha t  & ~ i p e  
i s  a synonym of w a n t .  The subs t i tu t ion  of one f o r  the  other results i n  
a successful  pattern match. 
1.) T ~ z c o ~ o ~ ~ .  The taxonomy relat ion T is  expressed i n  many ways i n  
English; perhaps "is a kind of" i s  the  most typica l :  
A dog is a kind of animal. 
A dog i s  an animal. 
Dogs are animals. 
The notation dog T mhaZ is  used to state ' this re la t ionship .  In  t h e  
lexicon i t  is represented by an edge from the dog entry t o  the a n k ~ z  
ent ry  labe l led  TI 
Werner's work on t h e  taxonomy r e l a t i o n  i n  memory models has shown 
t h a t  this r e l a t i o n  plays a c r u c i a l  role i n  lexical theory as w e l l  as i n  
~ r a c t i c a l  quest ion answering. H e  has discussed t h e  t h e o r e t i c a l  aspec ts  
of the taxonomy r e l a t i o n  a t  length (Werner 1969, 1972, 1973 ,  Perchonock 
and Werner 1969, Werner and Fenton 1970) and has used it in geveral s t u d i e s  
(Werner and Begishe 1969, 1970). 
Casagrande and Hale (1967) and Raphael (1968) use the name inch-  
sion f o r  this r e l a t ion .  It is c e r t a i n l y  related t o  set  inclusion.  If 
A T B then the set of ob jec t s  named by A, the extension of A, is a subseti 
of the set of objects named by B ,  the extension of 8 .  The set of dogs 
i s  t i  subset of the set of animals, If we look instead at the intensions 
of A and B, the sets of attributes implied by the terms, we agaln f i n d  
a set inclusion r e l a t ionsh ip  but  i n  the other d i rec t ion .  If A T B then 
the in tens ion  o f  A includes the in tens ion  of B. The characteristics that 
l e tas  i den t i fy  an object as a dog include the  c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s  t h a t  make 
it an animal. Because of the poss ib le  confusion about the direction o f  
the inc lus ion  relation, it seenied l i k e  a good idea t o  use another name. 
The term taxommy is  the na tu ra l  choice s i n c e  it i s  now well-known m 
anthropology. 
2. ) Synorapy. The synonymy r e l a t i o n  poses some d i f  f iwit philo- 
sophicqJ problems. Do two words ever have the same meaning, o r  are t h e r e  
always dif ferences?  What criteria can be used t o  decide whether two words 
41 
a r e  spnonymourUl Apresyan, ~o lkovsky  and   el ' Euk (1970 : 5) have a t  tempted 
t o  state a prec ise  c r i t e r ion :  the  two words should be s a n & c a l l ~  sub- 
s t i t u t a b l e  f 6 r  each other ,  t h e  meaning of one shouU be express ib le  through 
the  o ther  i n  any context. But t h i s  c r i t e r i o n  subst idutes  one problem f o r  
another. How can one t e l l  whether such a s u b s t i t u t i o n  is successful ,  
whether the  r e s u l t i n g  sentences have t h e  same meaning? It can be  argued 
t h a t  d i f f e r e n t  sentence forms exist: .precisely i n  order t o  allow t h e  ex- 
pression of di f ferences  i n  meaning. However impossible i t  may be t o  de- 
fine synonymy precisely ,  t h i s  concept i s  used d a i l y  i n  ordinary discourse* 
Dictionary writers use i t  constantly.  To sfmplify mat ters  it is  assumed 
her4 t h a t  the synonymy r e l a t i o n  holds between two words whenever any of 
t h e  d ic t ipna r i e s  i n  thz bibliography def ines  one as t h e  o ther .  This should 
I 1  be read as "rough synonymy" or approximate synonymy. 11 
b. -Anton$my. 
Antonymy has long been recognized as a l e x i c a l  r e l a t i o n .  Websterrs 
NW CoZZsgiate Dictionmy, f o r  esample, r egu la r ly  lists antonyms. I ts 
de f in i t ion  of cotd includes "Ant. Hot" (1951:161) (The definition of 
hot, although it mentions c ~ Z d ,  does not  include "Ant. cold" ) The same 
d ic t i aaa ry  defines antonym a s  "A word so upposed i n  meaning t o  another 
word t h a t  i t  negates o r  n u l l i f i e s  every s i n g l e  one of i t s  implicat ions.  11 
It is  t r u e  that antonymy ind ica te s  some important f a c t s  about impl icat ions ,  
and these  need t o  be captured, bu t  i t  is  not true t h a t  amttoyrny involves 
n q a r i n g  every proposition i n  sight. The problem is t h a t  t h e r e  are many 
kinds of oppositeness of meaning. 
W e  have found four separa te  l e x i c a l  r e l a t i o n s  whidt correspond t o  
separa te  subcategories of antonymy: complementarity, antonymy proper, 
converseness, and r e c i p r o t a l  kinship. 
1) CompZempntar<ty, i so la t ed  by Lyons (1968), is  t h e  kind of 
oppositeness t h a t  holds between single and married o r  male and fmaze. 
The den ia l  of one implies the  a s s e r t i o n  of t h e  other:  m e  a s s e r t i o n  of 
one implies the denia l  of t h e  other.  
I f  John is married, then John is  not  s i n g l e .  
I f  John i s  no t  married, then John is s i n g l e  
I f  John i m s i g g l e ,  then John i s  not married. 
I f  John is n o t  s ing le ,  then John is  married,  
j?"his kind of r e l a t i o n  seems t o  hold pr imari ly  between two ad jec t ives  o r  
two adverbs belonging t o  t h e  same pr imi t ive  concept. I f  we s e t  up a 
l e x i c a l  r e l a t i o n  COW, then t h e  appropr ia te  axiom schemes seem t o  be, 
f o r  &he case  where Ad j C O W  Ad j 2, i f  Z 2, looked a t  along dimension Z1 , 
has property Adj , then it a l s o  has t h e  property Not (Adj 2) and v i c e  versa. 7 
In t h e  nota t ion  used f o r  t h e  bemantic representat ions  i n  t h e  question- 
answering system t h i s  is s t a t ed :  
i f ,  on t h e  o ther  hand, it has the  property ~ o t  (Adjl) then i t  21 ao has 
the property Adj2 and vice ogrsa. 
(and s i m i l a r l y  f o r  adverbs).  :OMP is a symmetric r e l a t i o n .  I f  A C(IMP B, 
then B C O W  A. I n  o the r  words i t  is  its own inverse, jn t h i s  lexlcon

ava i l ab le  i n  both d i r ec t ions .  Anything marriageable i s  e i t h e r  married o r  
single4 nokboth;  if m e  tern applies,  the other must not. 
2.) Antonymy. Lyons r e s t r i c t s  the  tern antonyqj t o  the  ss tua t ion  
where the asser t ion  of one implies the denial  of the  other,  but the denial 
of one does not imply the  asser t ion  of the other.  ~ e d  and green are anto- 
nyms in this sense. I f  X i s  red, it is  not green. OR the other  hand, i f  
X i s  not red it does not have t o  be green. It could be blue o r  yellow in- 
stead. I I o t  or  cold behave i n  the same way. If X i s  hot  then it  i s  not cold, 
but i f  X is not hot we do not  know for sure t h a t  i t  i s  cold; it may j u s t  
be lukewarm. We set up a l e x i c a l  r e l a t i o n  ANTI t o  express t h i s  kind of 
antonymy . Again it appl ies  par ticularlj t o  ad j ec t i v e s  and adverbs belong- 
ing t o  the same primitive concept. The l e x i c a l  entry f o r  ANTI gives an 
appropriate axiom scheme fo r  the  case i n  which Adjl ANTI A d j ~ :  If Z2 is 
Adjl then it is not Adj2. 
Hozd~ (P(Z1,~2,Adjl))  ~otds(P(z~rz~,~~~t(~dj~))) 
(similarly f o r  adverbs. ) 
Verbs may be included in this kind of antonymy. Consider the p a i r s  
love-hate and open-shut. For a ch i ld ,  a t  l e a s t ,  "X loves Yt' may imply 
lC.X hates'~." The appropriate axiom scheme fo r  verbl ANTI verbZ would be: 
if a s imple  sentence containing verbl is t rue ,  then the negation, i s  t r u e  
when verb2 is  subs t i tu ted  fo r  verbl 
floZds(R(verbl, Zl, Z*, z3, Z4)) 
~ H ~ l d s ( R ( v e r b ~ , ~ ~ , ~ ~ , Z ~ , ~ ~ ) )  
Since such verb pa i r s  do not appear i n  our examples such problematical 
inferences have been avoided. 
There are some important semantic realities here which are not being 
captured. There is  a set  of inrnmpatible color  terms: red, orange, peZZow, 
peen, blue, purple, b r w ,  b h k ,  white. One can descr ibe  any small a rea  
of a physical ob j ec t  i n  one of these  terms i f  i t  i s  forbidden t o  use hedges 
Like turquoise and pink .  Hot and c o l d ,  l i k e  big and smaZZ, are opposite 
ends of a scale.  Between hot and c o t d ,  wm?n and cool can be placed some- 
where. Binary l e x i c a l  r e l a t i o n s  are not adequate here, Perhaps develop- 
ments i n  the theory of fuzzy se t s  w i l l  eventually provide a b e t t e r  de- 
scriptdon.  
There are l o g i c a l  problems here  too. I f  the  s t o r y  says t he  toy  is  
red ,  then we want t o  answer "no" t o  the  question "Is the  toy green?" 
But toys can be both r e d  and green i n  spots, patches, o r  s t r i p e e r  J E  
t he  s t o r y  says t h a t  the toy is  red and green, we do not want tl) ge t  l o s t  
inba self-contradict ion.  
Adjectives which imply grading (cf sec t ion  c below) involve poten- 
t i a l  se l f -contradic t ions  of a s l i g h t l y  d i f f e r e n t  kind. Lyons discusses  
the  sentence reference "A small elephant is  a l a rge  animal." The current  
representat ion fo r  t h a t  sentence i n  pur system would be: 
Z V l  =Ncorn(elephant,X1) PI =P.P(size,X1 ,small) 
& =Ncom(animal,X1) P2 =P(size ,XI ,large) 
For more d e t a i l s  see the  sec t ion  on semantic representat ions .  But 8man 
ANTI large so  w must conclude from P1 t h a t  P(size,X1,Not(large)). The 
problem i s  that when w e  c a l l  something a small elephant we imply a com- 
parison with some norm f o r  elephants.  However, this comparison does no? 
appear i n  our representat ion.  (This di?+i tul ty  has a l s o  been discussed 
by Bierwisch 1969 and S;Lmmons 1973,) 
3 . )  Cm~erseness. This is  Lyons' name fo r  a th i rd  kind of antonymy. 
A s  examples he gives the pa i r s  buy-se2Z aod husband-&fee  his kind of 
oppositeness does not seem to involve negation a t  all. Rather it in- 
volves some kind of permutation of the associated individuals. Dale 
c a l l s  this r e l a t i on  reciproci ty  and explains it t h i s  way: 
Buy and se l l  a r e  reciprocals,  a s  a re  give and 
receive. What die  tinguishes these from antonyms 
(which they are ,  i n  a sense) is tha t  whenever a 
sentence using one of them i s  appropriate, there 
i s  another appropriate sentence using the other 
member of the pair. For example, John h 9 e  books 
from Bill has the  same meaning as BiZZ sells books 
to John. He guve flowers t o  her has the same 
meaning as She received flowers from him. This is 
a s o r t  of "semantic passivet'--like the passive 
transformation i n  syntax, it presents the saiie 
meaning from a different point of view. (1972: 
144) 
Wether   ale's sentences have exactly the same meaning or  not i s  debatable, 
but anyone would agree that one implies the  other ,  What is needed i s  some 
compact way t o  indicate  what these other appropriate sentences are and t o  
V derive them when they a r e  needed. Zolkovsky and ~ei'xuk, (1970) have a 
clever way of doing t h i s  f o r  verbs. They use a flotation of the form: 
Buy CONV (3 2 1 4 )  S e l l  
to  indica te  tha t  
% buys Y2 from X3 for X4 
becomes 
X sells X2 to  XI f o r  X4 3 
We have borrowed t h i s  notat ion,  applying i t  t o  cases ra the r  than sub- 
jec ts  and objects.  It is in te res t ing  t h a t  the  Soviets include regular 
syntac t ic  passives i n  t h e i r  discussion of t h i s  r e l a t ion .  Since in t h i s  
systesn inferences a r e  made on the  basis of the  f u l l y  formed semantic rep- 
resentat ions  from which passives have been eliminated, they need not be  
included here. 
4.) RecipcaZ Kinship. Tf w e  had followed Reichenbach (1966) i n  
t r ea t ing  kinship r e l a t i o n s  as functions of several  arguments then wemc'ould 
have used CONV for  p a i r s  l i k e  husband-wzfe also.  Since kinship and s o c i a l  
re la t ionships  l i k e  teacher-student are expressed i n  terms of have, however, 
i t  makes sense t o  pos i t  a  new f e l a t i o n  RECK far RECiprocal Kinship and other 
s o c i a l  terms. Husband and wife re la t ionships  a r e  represented t h i s  way: 
Len is Martha's husband, R$%gtve, XI, X2,  husband) 
Martha is Len's wife R(have,X2,X1,wife) 
We want t o  b e  able t o  der ive  one of theselsentences from t h e  o ther ,  using 
the  l e x i c a l  information husband RECK wife, i.e. i f  X1 has X2 as  husbond 
then X2 has X1 a s  wife. The axiom scheme f o r  A WCR B says t h a t  i f  X1 has 
X2 a s  A then X2 has XI as B. 
HoZdaIR(have,X1,X2,A)) HoZds(R(have,X2,X1,B)) 
Ocher kxnds of converseness or  rec iproc i ty  have not occurred o f t e n  e~ough 
t o  warrant a  separate  r e l a t i o n  and a sephrate axiom scheme. They a r e  en- 
tered as individual  Inferences i n  each entry. 
Antonymy seems t o  be a highly diverse  l e x i c a l  concept. With fu r the r  
s tudy i t  may spawn still more l e x i c a l  re la t ions .  
0.  Grading. 
Grading r e l a t i o n s  l i k e  antonymy re l a t ions  involve a l t e r n a t i v e s  of 
some kind. Graded alternatives appear t o  be  organized i n  l is ts  o r  o ther  
kinds of formal s t ruc tures .  Our c o l l e c t i o n  of grading r e l a t i o n s  is i n  a 
state of fLux, many aspects  of grading are s t i l l  n o t  properly defined. 
1. ) meuzng. The notation Q is borrowed from Werner bu t  used i n  a 
very r e s t r i c t e d  sense t o  connect adjacent  items on lists, as i n    on day Q

2.) Set -ehnent .  SET r e l a t e s  t h e  name f o r  the set t o  t h e  name of the 
elements, e.g. flock SET sheep. This i s  t h e  r e l a t i o n  which the Soviets

Bevy of maidens, gaggle of geese, and it is c e r t a i n l y  a source of word-pla: 
3 .) Marrzfestatzm. By contrasf  the STAGE r e l a t i o n ,  as i n  zce STAGE 
water, seems very shaky, The axiom schemes a r e  not  s a t i s f a c t o r y  and some 
of the  t e r r i t o r y  is covered by t h e  CHILD r e l a t i o n  described i n  t h e  sec t ion  
on a t t r i b u t e  re la t fons .  
There seems t o  be a gap i n  our c o l l e c t i o n  here. We have no p a r a l l e l  
t o  t h e  comparison r e l a t i o n  of CWlagrande and dale (1967). Of course i n  
t h e  most common type of examples where the  i t e m s  r e l a t e d  are taxonomic 
Brothers,  o r  cohyponyms as they are soaetimes c a l l e a ,  t h e  comparison re- 
l a t i o n  can be =pressed by a combination of T and T. Recent work by 
Litowitz (1977) suggests  t h a t  comparisons are an important component of 
t h e  defining strategy of chi ldren.  The boundary between the grading re- 
l a t i o n s  and t h e  a t t r i b u t e  r e l a t i o n s  described i n  t h e  next s e c t i o n  is a l s o  
uncomfortably a r b i t r a r y .  
d, Aetrzbute ReZa$zons. 
According t o  Caeagrande and Hale (1967 168) whenever "X is defined 
with respect t o  one o r  more d i s t i n c t i v e  ow cha rac t e r i s t i c  a t t r i b u t e s  Y".

a d e f i n i t i o n  is "at t r ibut ive" .  Given this a l l - inc lus ive  descr ip t ion  it 
is not  surpr i s ing  t h a t  the  a t t r i b u t i v e  category was the l a r g e s t  i n  t h e i r  
sample. They propose several subcategories including stimulus p roper t i e s  
l i k e  s i z e  and color ,  d i s t i n c t i v e  markers, h a b i t a t ,  behavior, sex, gene- 
ra t ion ,  and l i n e  of descent. But i n  order t o  f a t i l i t a t e  inference w e  
need t o  assoc ia te  axiom schemes with each re l a t ion .  Thus we have broken 
these  subcategories into s t i l l  more prec ise  r e l a t l n s .  
1 . )  Maze. The r e l a t i o n  MALE as i n  drake MALE duck r e l a t e s  t h e  mas- 
culine t~ the unmarked term. We want t o  be ab le  t o  i n f e r  t h a t  if something 
is a drake, then it i s  a duck and i t  i~ male, i.e. 
Ncom(dralce, Z1) + Ncom(duck, Z1) A P(sex,  Zl ,male) 
This axiom can be derived when needed from an axiom scheme i n  the  l e x i c a l  
entry fo r  maze which says t h a t  whenever Z N 1  MALE ZN2 then a ZN1 is  a l s o  a 
ZN2 and if i s  male; i. e. , 
Ncom(ZN1, Z1) + Ncom (ZN2, ZI) A P(sex, Zl ,male) 
2.)  FmaZe. Similarly, FEMALE, as i n  l ioness  FEMALE Zion, r e l a t e s  
the  dame of the femade t a  the unmarked term. 
3 .) Tern6 for juveniZes. The most common a t t r i b u t e  r e l a t i o n  i n  our 
vocabulary is CHILD, which r e l a t e s  the  term f o r  the  offspr ing tn  t h e  term 
f o r  i t s  parent, as i n  puppy CHILD dog, kitten CHILD cat, lamb CHILD sheep. 
The lexical entry f o r  CHILD contains the  axiom scheme 
Ncom(ZN1, Z1) + Ncom(ZN2, Zl) A P(age,Zl ,young) 
m e n  puppy and dog have been subs t i tu ted  f o r  Z N 1  and ZNp respec t ive ly  we 
get  an axiom t ha t  te l ls  us t h a t  if Z1 id a puppy then Z 1  is a dog and Z1 
is  young.

Awca HOME th. 
5. ) Ckrmoteristic S o d  The r e l a t i on  SON was borrowed from the 
Soviets. SON relates an object  and the verb expressing the kind of 
sound it produces. 
to bark SON dog 
to roar SON Zion 
to meow SON cat 
to choa choo SON truin 
This re la t ion  s e a s  t o  underlie a c ruc ia l  p a r t  the vocabulary of 
young children. Wby i s  such a tremendous amount of time spent teaching 
children words like mem? Was this tntormation once l i f  e-preserving or  
is i t  a way of teaching how sound is  structured into words, the phonology 
of the language? For whatever reason, children who never see a farm are 
carefully kaught to  associa te  the sound moo with c&ws. 
6 .) Etcbs-t;ance. The r e l a t i on  w e  c a l l  MADEOF a s  in 
ski MADEOE wood 
relates an object  to  the substance of which i t  is made. Casagrande and 
Hale classify as provenience both batea: "which i s  made out of meequite" 
and milk: "we g e t  it  from a cow1' (1967:184). Since in-English these. re- 
lat ionships* a r e  expressed i n  d i f fe ren t  ways, for example, the s k i  is made 
~f woad - wooden ski, but milk comes from a caw - cow's milk, and since 
the appropriate inferences are different ( the  milk was once i n  the cow bu t  
the ski was not in  the wood), we chose to  class i fy  them separately.

These r e l a t i ons ,  among o thers ,  w i l l  be added eventually t o  our lexicon,

carburetor PART car 
The PART r e l a t i o n  seems t o  b e  crucial i n  t h e  d e f i n i t i o n  of many every day 
objec ts .  While it is  c l e a r l y  important-in computer models of memory, i t  
seems hard t o  i s o l a t e  from na tu ra l  English sentences, Raphael's (1968) 
S I R  model used some s u b t l e  h e u r i s t i c s  t o  determine whether a pa r t i cu l a r  
ins tance  of the verb have should be represented by t h e  p m t  r e l a t i o n  o r  
t he  c p ~ n  re la t ion .  Sometimes dialog with a human is necessary t o  resolve  
the a s i g u i t y .  Simmons (1973) recognizes a three-way ambiguity i n  have 
which is  represented var ious ly  as HASPART, POSSess, and ASSOC (1973:76) 
Mary has long f ingers  HASPART 
Mary has money POSSess 
Mary has fun i n  the  park ASSOC 
Apparently t h e  part-whole r e l a t i o n  is hard t o  i d e n t i f y  i n  Papago a l so .  
Casagrande and Hale do not f ind  it i n  t h e i r  Papago sample. They classjfy 
tl as exemplification de f fn i t ionZwhich ,a re  t r ans la ted  i n t a  English as cows 
I 1  have horns" and "horses have t a i l s .  However, on, t h e  ba s i s  of i n t u i t i o n  
and t_he word-association data of Russell and Jenkins (1954) they p o s i t  a 
fourteenth r e l a t i o n  (1967:191): 
Constituent: X is defined as being a const i tuent  
o r  part of Y. 
The example given is cheek-face. 
Apresyan, M e 1  h k  an'd 3olkovsky do not have an e x p l i c i t  part-whole 
r e l a t i on  but they do include tGo re la t ions  in  this same area. We have

Jespersen was intrigued by this mechanisa which he named individuatizat<on 
(1933:209); he discovered and l i s t e d  many such examples. This seems t o  
be the relation which the ECD calls SING (Apresyan et al,  1970:11). 
5.) Provenience. We include here a l so  the r e l a t i on  COMESPROM, as i n  
milk COMESPROM cad. This  is one aspect of the  relation which Casagrade 
and Hale (1967) c a l l  provenience. (It should passibly be  l i s t e d  as an 
attribute r e l a t i on  along with i ts  close cousin MADEOF.)' 
Our current  lexicon contains only two axioms f o r  the part-whole re- 
l a t ion .  One i s  transitivity: i f  X PART Y and Y PART Z, then X PART 2. 
The other, borrowed from Raphael, connects PART and Taxonomy. Essent ia l ly

it says t h a t  i f  a l l  X ' s  a r e  Y ' s  and a l l Y 1 s  have 2 ' s  as parts ,  then a l l  
X ' s  also have 2 ' 6  as par ts .  There i s  an extensive philosophical l i t e -  
rature involving th i s  re la t ion .  Martin (1971) presents a system of axioms 
fo r  part-whole and a review of work by Lesniewski, Woodger, and Tarski. 
f. TypicaZ-Case ReZatwns . 
Casagrande and Hale discovered that ce r t a in  fami l iar  objects ,  body 
parts, foods, tools ,  and other  objects of mater ial  cu l tu re  were most 
of ten  defined not by the re la t ions  discussed above but ra the r  by t h e i r  
use i n  daily l i f e ,  by common a c t i v i t i e s  associated with them. For ex- 
ample, under t he  I1functiontl r e l a t i on  they classify examples i n  which "X 
is  defined as the  means of effecting Y" such a s  
eye: ". . .with which w e  see things" 
money : I f .  . .we buy things with it" (1967 : 175) 
The "operational1' c l a s s  includes examples in which X is defined as "the 
characteristic goal or recipient" of action Y 
bridle: " . . .which they put on horses" (1967 :178) 
What they c a l l  the "spat ia l"  r e l a t i o n  a l so  seem t o  be  of t h i s  same type, 
grindstone: "...on which a kni fe  is sharpened" (1967:177) 
Folk def in i t ions  col lec ted  from speakers of English o f ten  are of t h i s  
var ie ty ,  sometimes combined with taxonomy, e.g.  "a house is  a bui lding 
i n  whfch people reside" (Evens 1975:340). Children i n  par t icular  seem 
t o  p r e f e r  funct ional  de f in i t i ons  (cf .  Ruth ~ r a u s s '  co l l ec t i on  of chil- 
dren's de f in i t ions ,  A Bole is t o  Dig, 1952). 
Apresyan, Mel1c!uk, and Zolkovsky's system includes a family of 
f u n d i o n s  S1, S 2 ,  Sg, $4 which r e l a t e  nouns and verbs o r  adjec t ives .  
Their semantic s t ruc tures  are based on grammatical r e l a t ions .  For verbs 
these are a subject  r e l a t ion ,  a d i r e c t  object  r e l a t ion ,  and two kinds of 
ind i rec t  object  relatiotls.  The functions S1, S2,  S j ,  and S4 correspond t o  
these grammatical re la t ions .  S1 r e l a t e s  the  verb t o  i t s  gener ic  subject.  
S2 r e l a t e s  t h e  verb t o  its generic d i r e c t  ob jec t ,  e tc .  For example (1970:lO: 
S ( t o  s e 1 l ) ~ s e l l e r  1 
S2(to sell)=goods ( t h a t  which i s  sold) 
S ( t o  se l l )=buyw,  c l i e n t ,  customer ( the  one t o  whom the  goods 
3 -  a r e  sold) 
S 4 ( t o  s e l l ) = p r i c e  ( tha t  f o r  which the  goods a r e  sold)  
The Em a l so  contains four other  substantive r e l a t i o n s  (1970:ll). The 
values a r e  nouns. The arguments can apparently be verbs, ad jec t ives  o r  
Rouns. F i r s t  is Smod whxch gives the  noun denoting the? mode of ac t ion> 
%od (to write)=hmdwritzng. Sl0, g ives  the  noun denotlng t h e  place of t h e  
argument; Slot (act<on)=scene. Sinst, g ives  t h e  noun denoting t h e  inatru- 
ment; S ~ s t r I ~ ~ m n i c a t i o n ) n e m 2 s ,  SinLnstr (to think)=brazn. S,,, gives 
the  noun denoting the  r e s u l t ;  Sres(to hunt)=bq. 
Since the  semantic representat ions i n  t h e  question-answering system 
are structured m terms of cases  t a the r  than g r m t i c a l  re lac ions  we 
have s e t  up a group of "typical-case1' r e l a t ions ,  one f o r  each case re- 
l a t i o n  i n  our case system. The typical-case r e l a t i o n  r e l a t e s  t h e  verb 
t o  typical  f i l lers  of t h a t  c a s e  argument s l o t .  Thus, corresponding t o  
the  semantic r e l a t i o n  AGENT we  have a l a i c a l  r e l a t i o n  TAGENT. The f a c t  
that someone who bakes can be ca l led  a baker is expressed i n  our lexicon 
baker TAGENT t o  bake

The smff thgt you eat is usaa l ly  called B o d ;  pbbd TOBJEZT ?0 eat.

(This i s  the Casagrande and Hale operat ional  r e l a t i on . )  Most p lan t s  
sprout from earth.: earth TSOURCE to sprout. One who loves is called a 
lover;  b v e r  TEXPR to  Zove. People usually bake cakes i n  a ki tchen;  
kitclzm mOC to  bake2. It should be noticed that t he  r e l a t i o n  TLOC 
bears  zt c l o s e  resemblance t o  HOME which gives t h e  t y p i c a l  h a b i t a t  Mr 
an ahimal o r  o ther  objec t .  The Soviet r e l a t i o n  S1, seems t o  include 
both. It is not  clear that eemantic theory can justify usidg two re- 
l a t i o m  here. We have made a dis t i tnct ion because our system of seman- 
tic representa t ions  treats nouns and verbs differently, so t h a t  the 
associated axiom schemes f o r  TLOC and a r e  formally d i f f e r e n t .  It 
would be poss ib le  t o  use  only oqe r e l a t i o n  and test t h e  argument for 
p a r t  of speech before choosing an axiom scheme Perhaps the real prob- 
lem is i n  the system of semantic representa t ions .  
This pa r t i cu l a r  choice of l e x i c a l  r e l a t i w s  is based on the par t i -  
cular case system being used. We claim, however, that thewame bas i c  
scheme would be  e f f e c t i v e  f o r  a lexicon functioning with a different 
system o f  semantic represen ta t ions  based on m y  other  s e t  of case o r  
grammatical r e la t ions .  This IS so since i n  this scheme corresponding LO 
each semantic relation i n  the eemantic representa t ion  there is  a l e x i c a l  
r e l a t i o n  i n  t h e  lexicon r e l a t i n g v e r b s  and typical f i l l e r s  of argument 
d o t s .  
g. Other CoZZocation ~ e z a t i o n s .  
The r e l a t i o n s  i n  t h i s  group, l i k e  the  typ ica l  case r e l a t i o n s  exm 
amined i n  t h e  preceding sec t ion ,  are basical ly  ooocurrence r e l a t ions .  
They connect words which cooccur conqtantly and point  t o  words which 
have spec ia l  meanings i n  p a r t i c u l a r  contexts.  This fs an  important  pa^ L 
of the  l e x i c a l  knowledge of the na t ive  speaker of ten  neglected i n  dic- 
t ionar ies .  Most of our r e l a t i o n s  i n  t h i s  group are borrowed from the 
Soviet lexicographers: COPUL, LIQU, PREPAR, DEGRAD. 
1.)  Special Coputa Verb. The COPUL r e l a t i o n  ind ica te s  the cor- 
r e c t  copula verb for  nouns where belbecome is not  appropriate.  For 
example, t o  fa22 i s  t h e  spec ia l  copula verb f o r  victim, t o  fuzz COPUL 
victim, a s  in "Constance fell victim t o  Louis' aharm. 11 
2.) Destroying Verb. LIQU r e l a t e s  a noun and the  verb which means 
t o  l i q u i d a t e  o r  destroy it. This seems t o  be usefu l  i n  English as well 
and some examples belong t o  a c h i l d ' s  vocabultary. 
t o  erase LIQU mistake 
t o  wipe ou t  LIQU traces 
3 , )  Srepare for use. The r e l a t i o n  PREPAR r e l a t e s  a noun and t h e  verb 
which means t o  prepare the objec t ,  t o  make it ready f o r  use. This is par- 
ticularly usefu l  in making deductions about why people are doing things.  
t o  lay PREPAR tabzs 
t o  make PMPAR bed 
to b a d  PREPAR guz 
4 . )  Verb t o  deteriorate. The r e l a t i o n  DEGRAD connects nouns and t h e  
appropriate verbs meaning t o  de te r iora te .  t o  20 bad. 
t o  decay D E G W  t ee th  
to wear put DEGRAII clothes 
5 .  ) Incream and decrease i n  ac t i v i fy .  The p a i r  of r e l a t i o n s  INC- 
rease  and DECrease connect nouns and special-purpose verbs f o r  increase  
and decrease. 
t o  grow INC ch<ld 
t o  sbznk DEC cZot;h 
0 - ( In  terms of the Soviet r e l a t i o n s  INC (x) =Incep (Plus(x) ) and DEC (x) =1ncep 
(Minus (x) ) . ) 
6.) Preposition - Object. PREPOS behaves much like t he  r e l a t i o n  
which the Soviets c a l l  LOC. It l i n k s  s u i t a b l e  preposi t ions  t a  particular; 
nouns. In  English th ings  gr, on lisbe, not  in them. The f a c t  that on 
is  the appropria te  prepositxon for  l i s t  i s  recorded as on PREPOS Zest. 
These are a l l  co l l aca t iona l  r e l a t i o n s  that we have observed i n  our 
data.  Mel'&k's ECD contains  even mare col loca t ion  r e l a t i o n s  bdt w e  
have n o t  included them because they seem too l ~ t e r a r y  o r  too sophis t l -  
cated for t h e  vocabulary of chi ldren s s t o r i e s .  For example, Bon (Apresyar 
Melt Euk, and ~o lkovsky  1970 : 13) poin ts  t o  a t t r i b u t e s  meaning "good": 
Boa (conditions) = favor& Ze 
Bon (aimsh= Zo f t y  
Both the typical-case,relat ions md t he  o ther  co l loca t ion  relations 
which we have d e s c r i b d a r e  syntagmatic r e l a t ions .  They connect words 
with other words which coocur f requent ly  i n  n a t u r a l  language sentences, 
sometimes with s p e c i a l  meanings. We t u r n  now t o  a group of paradigmatic 
r e l a t i o n s  which connect wards which express aspects  of the same core  of 
meanlpg as i t  appears i n  various contexts o r  in d i f f e r e n t  p a r t s  of speech. 
h. Paradigmatic Rehtions . 
The r e l a t ions  which w e  have grouped together as paradigmatic r e l a t i o n s  
are highly disparate i n  kind and importance. CAUSE, BECOME, and Nomare, 
we believe, essential t o  the structlve of the English lexicon; ABLE and 
@JN seem potent ia l ly  q u i t e  useful. There seem t o  be very few e m p l e s  
of BE. /ill except BECOME were influenced by t h e  inventory of Apresyan; 
V 
Zolkovs'ky , and M e 1  ' Euk . 
1 )  Cacse. Tradi t ional  d i c t iona r i e s  use-cause constantly to descr ibe  
re la t ionships  between verbs. Dennison (1972) def ines  t o  send as "to 
causk t o  go". KebsterFe Neu CoZZegiate (1951) defines t o  boiZ as "to 
cauae t o  bubble.. . ." (p.96). Schank (1975) treats cause as t h e  most Lm- 
portant  r e l a t ion .  McCavley ( 1 9 7 5 ~ )  i n  discussing t o  open argues f o r  two 
l e x i c a l  e n t r i e s ,  open1 f o r  " in t rans i t ive"  uses : "the door opened" and 
I1 open2 for " t rans i t ive"  uses: "John opened t h e  door. Openl and o p 3  
arp r e l a t ed  by cause: t o  open2 is t o  cause t o  openl. McCawleyls fonrm- 
l a t i o n  w i l l  be followed here. 
The first and longest  entry i n  Websterrs Nm CoZZegiate Diatwnary 
f o r  Open belongs t o  the  ad jec t ive .  The d e f i n r t i o n  of the  i n t r a n s i t i v e  
verb6 begins "to become open". This suggests a renumbering : 
open1 - ad jec t ive  - "the doot is open" 
open2 - t o  become open1 - verb i n t r a n s i t t v e  -. '%he door opens" 
open3-to cause t o  open2 - verb transitive - "John opens the  door" 
@en is only one of hundreds of verb-adjective homographs i n  English. Coo'l 
behaves like opm. We start with the adjective coozl, "the jel lo  was 
cool". me intraneitive wan cool2 means "to become cool " 9 "the j e l l o  
11 cooled in the refrigerator." The tranait&ve verb cooZ3 means t o  cause 
t o  become cooZ1" , "Jane coaled the j sllo in the refrigerator. 'I Other 
verb-adjective homographs l ike  clean h o w  a different pattern, the in: 
transitive verb is missing. 
cleanl - adjective - The rodm was clean. 
$clean? - to become cleanl~- %he room cleaned. 
clean2 - to cause to become c3 !an] - Jane cleaned the room. 
Not all verb-adjective pairs are homograt)hs. Mobm Englis l  retains 
traces af an o l d  suffix -en which turns adjectives into verbs. To 
reddm i s  to make or become red. Somatimes the verb and the adjective 
are etymologically distant: t o  agel is to become old.  
We need a lexical  relation CAUSE re la tin^ s d  and go, openg ,d 
QPm2 
send CAUSE go 
openj CAUSE open 2 
The appropriate a x i o ~  scheme for the case verbl CAUSE verbZ te l l s  us that:

2 .) $ecome ~ d j e c t i v e .  We alsov need a lexical relation BECOME 
relating age, an8 oZd, open, and open, . 
a w l  BECOME 0x2 
redden BECOME red 
*Pm 2 BECOME @m 1 
I f  verbl BECOME adjl; then i f  t he  sentence containing verbl holds ,  then 
the  object  t h a t  did t he  becoming must now have the property expressed by 
the  adjec t ive ,  i.a 
~oZds(~(verb~,~~,Z~,Z~,Z~)) * ~ o Z d s ( r ) ( ~ ~ ~ , ~ ~ , a d j ~ ) )  
where ZC1 is t h e  pr imit ive concept corresponding to  adgl. (Th i s  axiom 
may conceivably r eac t  i n  uncomfortable ways with tense.) For the moment 
?1 the r e l a t i o n  between czem2 and cZeanl the  cause to become" re la t ion  
w i l l  be compounded from CAUSE and BECOME4 It will probably occur o f ten  
enough t o  deserve a name of i t s  own, perhaps MAKE. 
3. ) Be. The r e l a t i o q  BE p a r a l l e l s  BECOME very close ly .  While 
BECOME r e l a t e s  t he  verb of becoming and the predicate ad jec t ive ,  BE re- 
lates t he  verb of being and t h e  predicate  adjec t ive .  For example, to  
neigh&o~ is the verb which means t o  be near. 
to neighbor BE near 
This is the  inverse of the r e l a t i o n  which the Soviets c a l l  PRED. For 
some reason it seems t o  be much less common than BECOME. 
4. )  Process Nacn mrd Verb. NOMV relates a process noun and i ts  
f i  
verb. Death is the  nominalization of the  verb to  die; death NOMV to d i e .  
  his is the  Soviet  r e l a t i o n  V and the  inverse  of t h e  r e l a t i o n  So: ) 0 
5 . )  Adjective and m n .  The relation ADJW, t he  inverse of the 
Soviet Ag, r e l a t e e  ad jec t ives  and nouns, as i n  s d a ~  ADJN sun. This re- 
lation m y  have to be splxt i n to  two o r  more pieces. Magnus Ljp'ilg (1970) 
60 
suggests that adjectives formed from nouns by adding -y, e.g. sunny as 
opposed t o  8 d 0 ,  mean "having more than a normal amount of" whatever 
the noun denotes. Adjectives i n  -a1 and -ful may present certain othex 
semantic regularities. 
6.) Able. The relat ion ABLE i s  used in combination with case re- 
lations only. 
undersknd#b Ze OB JECT*ABLE t o  understand 
Z.iterute AGENT*ABLE to read 
legible OBJECTJcABLE to read 
The Soviet version o f  thjs relation has different eubcategoriee - Ablel ,  
Able2, Able3, Able4 - t o  indicate grammatical arguments of the verb. 
Ablel (to burn) = cornZnc8tibZe things are precisely those which can be sub- 
j e c t s  of the verb to bum. On the other hand, Ablep(to eat) 
gince edible things are those which can be objects of the verb to eat, 
Since the semantic representation system in  the questrion-answerer uses 
cases to connect verbs and arguments, we handle different kinds of ABLE- 
ness by combining ABLE with a case. 
7.) ImeguZar imperative. The relation IMPER comes directly from 
the Soviet inventory. It relates colloquial imperative expressions to  the 
appr~priat  e milin verb. 
fire! IMPER t o  shoot 
go ahead! ~ E R  t o  t a l k  
This relation esgential ly  involves very irregular imperatives; and this 
brings us to the inflectional relations. 
I n f l e c t i o n a l  r e l a t i o n s  are d u l l  but  usefu l .  Regu?ar noun p l u r a l s  
and verb forms are handled by a suffix-chopping algorithm by t  words l i k e  
men and 8cz7zg defea t  it completely. We get  around t h i s  d i f f i c u l t y  i n  
e s s e n t i a l l y  the same way as some conrmercial d i c t i o n a r i e s  do. A separa te  
entry  i s  included f o r  these  words. The l e x i c a l  entry f o r  m e n  c%nsis ts  
of PLURAL man. The en t ry  f o r  sang i s  PAST-to sing; for swrg we have PP 
t o  sing. The axiom-generator f o r  PLURAI, changes t h e  number a s s o c ~ a t e d  
with  t h e  ob jec t  i f  necessary and moves t o  t h e  main en t ry  t o  pick up o the r  
axiom scheme% there.  
The i n f l e c t i o n a l  r e l a t i o n s  are, of course, paradigmatic r e l a t i o n s ,  
bu t  a r e  groupea separa te ly  because of their s t t o n g  family resemblance 
and p a r t i c u l a r l y  unin te res t ing  nature.  
5. THE ORGANIZATION OF THE LEXICON AND THE SEMANTIC REPRESENTATIONS 
The lexicon is  a l a r g o  network i n  which the nodes a r e  l e x i c a l  
e n t r l e s  and t h e  a r c s  are l e x i c a l  r e l a t i o n s ;  a l l  t h e  arcs are double- 
To represent  the nework  i n  t h e  data base, each en t ry  conta ins  a 
l i s t  of a t t r ibu te-va lue  p a i r s .  Each p a i r  c o n s i s t s  of an arc (1.e. a 
r e l a t i o n  name) and the name of t h e  e n t r y  a t  t h e  o t h e r  end o f  t h e  arc. 
Each l e x i c a l  r e l a t iono  L has  an inverse  r. I f  en t ry1  contains  the  
l.r 
a t t r ibu te-va lue  pair L-en try^, then entry2 conta ins  L-entryl. 
Each r e l a t i o n  a l s o  has a l e x i c a l  en t ry  which gives i ts  p roper t i e s  and 
a l s o  tells how t o  f f i terpret  l e x i c a l  r e l a t ionsh ips  i n  t h e  p red ica te  cal-  
culus. For example, t h e  e n t r y  f o r  dag includes  t h e  information dog T 
anma2 (dog is taxonomically re la ted  t o  anumrl). The system use, the 
information i n  the  l e x i c a l  entry f o r  T t o  i n t e r p r e t  this  as* 
~oZds  (Ncom (dox, X) ) - Ho Me (Neon (animal, X) ) 
The l e x i c a l  entry for T a l so  tells us t h a t  T i s  t r ans i t i ve .  The in- 
ventory of r e l a t i ons  is expandable. To add a relation we need only add 
a lexical entry, 
When the meaning of the  word cannot be expressed so l e ly  i n  terms

mcom (animal, Z1) A Ncom (human, Z2) 
A R ( m ;  Z2,Zl) 
This becomes the  @xiom 
HoZds (Ncom (pet, Z1) ) -r Holds (Neom (animal, Z1) ) A 
HoZds(Ncom(human,Z2)) A HoZds(R(own,~~ ,Z~) )  
If an h d i v i d u a l  21 is a P e t ,  then 21 i s  an animal and is owned by a 
human Z2, 
Thus this lexicon i s  a r e l a t i o n a l  network model with words and 
Lexical r e l a t i o n s  as semantic primes. Defini t ions are w r i t t e n  using 
lexical r e l a t i o n s  and f i rs t  order predica te  ca lculus  formulas. 
The design of t h i s  lexicon i s  independent of a p a r t i c u l a r  repre-

representations i s  included here i n  order t o  enable t he  reader t o  under- 
stand the notat ion i n  the examples of l ex i ca l  entries i n  the n.ext sect ion.  
Anyone who does not f ind  nota t ional  problems a t t r a c t i v e  should skip thesew

of t h i s  paper w i l l  make sense without it. 
An Ooervia? of the System of Semantic Pepreeentatiae . 
The question-answering system o f  which t h i s  lexicon i s  a fundamental 
pa r t  uses a f i r s t  order predicate  calculos system of semantic representa- 
tions., As it readse paragraph, the system makgs an i n t e r n a l  model of 
the  s tory,  ident i fy ing  objects and events and the re la t ionsh ips  between 
them. The representat ions a r e  wr i t ten  i n  a S i r s t  order predica te  calculus  
so that they can be used i n  an exis t ing  theorem prover (Henschen, Over- 
beck, and Wos 1W4)= a a f i rq t  order predicate  calculus we a r e  allowed 
predicates, functions, and quantifiers like "there exists" and "for all" 
but predicates a r e  not  allowed t o  be arguments of other  predicates. This 
pa r t i cu la r  calculus  is many-sorted; that is, there  a r e  many dizferene 
c lasses  of objec ts  i n  the system. 
Suppose a s tory  begins : 
Peter  heard a meow. Mother sa id ,  "The k i t t e n  
is hungry." ,She sen t  Petek t o  the s to re .  He 
bought milk and a big, red lo l l ipop.  
A s  we process t h i s  s to ry  w e  need f i r s t  of all t o  recognize t h e  d i f f e r e n t  
e n t i t i e s  in  t he  story.  Here w e  have seven individual  objec ts :  
XI - Peter X5 A- store 
X2 - meow 
X3 - Mother 
X4 - k i t t e n  
X6 - milk 
X7 - l o l l i pop  
We can write Ncom(lollipop,X7) to signify that X7 is  a lollipop since 
ZoZZipop i s  the common noun that names X7. The story mentions two pro- 
perties of the lollipop; it 18 b i ~  and it is red. The lexicon t u s  
us that red is an adjective of cqlor, SO w e  represent this property 
using a functional notation 
Ptcolor ,X7, red) 
Similarly, 
P ( s i ze  ,X7, big) 
records the fact that the lollipop is  big. These propertAes are num- 
bered and put on a list f o r  convenient retrieval. We may wrlte 
PI = P(color,X7,red) P2 = P(siza,X7,big) 
This story also tells us some relations between entities. " ~ e  bought 
a lollip~p,'~ can be expressed as 
R1 = R(buy,X1,X7) 
since he refers to XI, Peter, and X, is the 1ollipop.The third sentence 
in the story: 
SHe sent Peter t o  the more 
contalns a relation Rg 
R j  = R(send,Xj,Xl) 
and a property of that relation 
P4 P(direction,Rg,X5) 
The predicate fioZds is  used to make assertions. To assert the t h i rd  
sentence we write 
Ho zd8 (P4) 
me connection between the  milk and the l o l l i p o p  i n  t h e  l a s t  sentence 
i s  described by an i n t e r r e l a t i o n  I, I(and,X6,X7) s o - t h a t  t h e  whole sen- 
tence becomes 
Bozds(R(buy,~~,I(and,~~,X~)) 
(There i s  a r u l e  t o  rewr i te  t h i s  later a s  
" BoZds (R(buy ,xl ,x6)) A hzds  (R(bujr , x1 ,X7) ) 
hue it is  applied only i f  some kind of inference is required from t h i s  
sentence, ,e. g., if a question asks,   id Peter  buy some milk?") 
To obtain  these representat ions  we,  of course, need a great d e a l  
of in? ormation from t h e  lexicon ( l i k e  the  information mentioned above 
t h a t  red  is an  ad jec t ive  of co lor  and t h a t  big i s  an a d j e c t i v e  of s i z e ) .  
I exical  information i s  a l so  used i n  s e t t i n g  up representat ions  f o r  
quest ion s l i k e  
1. What color  is  the  Ia l l ipop?  
P(color,X7, ?) 
The answer t o  t h i s  question can be  found by a simple matching process 
because the s t o r y  representat ion a l ready contains  t h i s  kind of lexical 
information. A quest ion such a s  
2. Did Pe ter  buy some candy? 
requi res  f u r t h e r  l e x i c a l  lookup s ince  t h e  word candy does n o t  appear 
in the s to ryd  The answer i s  found using the l e x i c a l  r e l a t i o n  T (taxonomy 
o r  class inclusion)  between ZoZZipop and candy - the ent ry  for- l o l l i p o p  in-  
cludes T candy. Similarly,  the entry  f o r  candy includes !? ZoZZipop, 
where 1 is  t h e  inverse or, converse r e l a t i o n  of T ,  which relates the 
same p a i r s  of ob jec ts  i n  t h e  opposi te  order.  Likewise a mul t ip l e  choice

i n  t h e  e n t r i e s  f o r  milk and eat?. The quest ion 
4. Where d id  Pe ter  grp? 
is represented 
P(direction,R(go ,XI) ,?) 
The lexicon is  then used to look f o r  cohnections between go and send. 
The l e x i c a l  entry  fol; send includes the  information CAUSE do. The en t ry  
f o r  t h e  l e a rn1  r e l a t i o n  CAUSE contains severa l  axiom schemes. With send 
and go subs t i tu t ed  i n  the correc t  pos i t ions  we get  t h e  axioms 
Holds(R(send,Zl,Z2)) - Holds (R(cause,ZI, ( R ( g o  ,Z2))) 
and 
HoZds(R(cause,Z1,ZR1)) ' Hold$[ZR1) 
In order t o  answer t h e  quest ion

W s  has been an extremely brief introduction t o  the semantic s y s t a  
used i n  me question-answering scheme of which t h i s  lexicon is  a part.  
For those who are in teres ted  i n  t he  representat ions themselves Appendix

6. THE FORM OF THE LEXICAL ENTRY 
The most c ruc i a l  s t e p  f o r  t h e  lexicographer is the  design of t h e  
l e x i c a l  entry. Somehow a l l  t he  d i f f e r en t  kinds of l e x i c a l  information 
previously decided upon must be neatly packaged i n t o  a compact, con- 
s i s t e n t ,  and accessible package. The l e x i ~ o n  1s a l a r g e  network i n  which 
the  nodes are lexical e n t r i e s  and Che a rc s  are l e x i c a l  r e l a t i ons .  Lexi- 
cal entries can be  found from an alphabet ic  l i s t ,  so t ha t  t h e  network 
may be entered a t  any point. There is a subnetwork contatlning l e x i c a l  
r e l a t i ons  and t h e i r  l og i ca l  propert ies .  
Each entry begins w i t h  the le t tex atring which names it. Homo- 
graphs are numbered 1,2,3, ... t o  prevent confusion. Thus, oZt3arl is 
the adject ive ,  clear2 is the verb 'to become cZearlr, and c'learg is the 
verb ' t b  cause t o  c2earp1 or ' t o  cause to  become cZsmI1. Entries con- 
(i) Category - Part of speech, s o r t ,  lexical r e l a t i o n ,  etc. 
( i i )  Irregular inflectional morphology. 
This latter is stated i n  terms of a special set of lexical rela- 
tions-- PAST, PI? (past  p a r t i c i p l e ) ,  and PLUR(a1) are the only ones 
nebded for ou r  simple data-base. The lexical entry f o r  make includes 
- 
PAST - made, - mads. Made has a separa te  l e x i c a l  entry but a very 
shor t  one 
mude PAST - make 
PP - make 
The l a i c a l  entry for c h d d  includes PLUR - chzldren, the lexical entry 
far  chzZdren consis ts  of: 
chz Zdren FLUR - chzZd 
(lii) Lexical r e l a t i o n s  and pointers to thelr values in the fom 
of attribute-value pairs. The l e x i c a l  entry f o r  puppy contairk CHILD 
- 
- dog. The lexical  entry f o r  dog contains CHILD - puppy. The l e x i c a l  
en t ry  for the l e x i c a l  r e l a t i o n  CHILD tells us  how t o  i n t e r p r e t  these. 
It contains an axio111 scheme which when f i l l e d  i n  tel ls  us t h a t  X is a 
puppy i f  and only i f  X i s  a dog and X is young Ncbm(puppy,X) means 
t h a t  Ncom(dog,X) and also P(age,X,ygung). Information o f t e n  classed as 
der iva t iona l  morphology w i l l  be included here ,  the  l e x i c a l  en t ry  for

information could be ~ t a t e d  instead i n  general rules and probablv 
should b e  Ln any larger data base. 
bv)- Parameters appropriate to particular categories. 
(v) Def init~ons. These are in the form of logical inferences 
that may be drawn when a ~ i v e n  word is used, and which are idiosyn- 
cratic enough not to be coded in terms of lexical relations. Only a 
few words have definitions. Puppy, for example, does not because 
the information that a puppy is a young dog 1 s  indicated by the lexi- 
c a l  relation CHILD - dog. Pet, on the other hand, has a def in i t ion 
Ncom(pet,Z1) Ncom(animal,Zl) A Rcom(human,Z2) A R(own,Z2,Z1) 
When thxs def m i t i o n  i s  retrieved i t  is transformed into the axiom 
Hdds (Ncom(pet, Z1) )+ RoZds (Neom Canunal ,Z1) ) A 
Holdb(Ncom(human,z2)) h BoZds(R(own,~~,Z~)) 
In other words, i f  some indivxdual 21 is a pet, then Zl is an anmal 
owned by some human Z2, 
Omitted from this  lexicon are the examples which are an important 
and valuable par t  of other diczionaries. This system does no t  have 
the generalizing power to  use examples effectively and, m addition, 
they occupy a great deal of space. The most natural way of handling 
examples in  such a model might be to accumulate tZl- from semantzc 
representations o f  sentences which the system parses. The task of 
organizing, pruning, and generalizing from examples is  too formidable 
to tackle here. 
Nouns: Taxonomy seems to b e  the most important l e x i c a l   elation 
Eor nouns, but many others appear in  the texts as w e l l .

Count/Mass Count \I Mass 
Originally, following Winograd, the number and count features were com- 
bined i p t o  a single feature with three values: singular, plural ,  and 
mass. B u t  McCawUy has recently (1975a) given examples of plural mass 
nouns: oZothes guts, bra%s, e t c .  I t  is impossible t o  argue with 
counterexamples from everydgy language. The feature information can 
be expressed compactly as a vector of  1's and 0 ' s .  
Gender Anhat enes s Number Count 
red 1 0 0  1 0 0  1 0  1 0  
PUPPY 1 1  5 1 1  0 1 0  1 0

boat 0 1 1  0 1 1  0 1 0  
clothes 0 0 1 0 0.1 0 1 0 1 
These features are used to determine pronoun choice, for example, not to 
provide semantic information. Puppy is marked as having the feature 
b a n  so that the system can parse "the puppy who barks1' and "the cat 
who walks alone. tt 
Definitions for nouns begin with the specification of the function, 
Ncom or Nprop; 
BANK Ncom(bank,Z1): P(location,R(save,Z2,Z3),Prep(in,Z1)) 
(A bank is a place where thitlgs are saved.) 
Smith and Maxwell 41977) include here commonly understood metaphorical 
extensions, metaphorical cliches (e. g. pitch=heZZ) . These also can be 
expressed by lexical relations (cf. the Soviet Flgur function which gives 
figurative f oms; presumably pitch Figur heZZ) . No obvious ones occur 
in this data base, so that this item is not currently included.

Ron-CopuZa Verb8  Every non-copula verb entry includes case in- 
formation, in the tom of a list of one or more arguments. For eqch 
argument we need four pieces of information: 
(i) How it IS realized syntactically: subject, object ,  
or a list of prepositions. 
(ti) The case (s) involved. 
(iii) Whether the case must be explicit ly'  speclrlea W B L ~ ,  
whether it is optional and unnecessary (OPT), or 
whether when absent i t  must be understood (ELLiptical). 
(iv) Selection preferences: the top node of the taxonomy 
subtree. 
(The c las s i f i ca t ion  names i n  (iii) are borrowed from the SPEECHLIS 
project, Nash-Webber, 1974). The e l l ip f i ca l  cases belong to verbs

khich Chomsky (1965) marked [+objrct-deletion] , which allow the object 
deletion transformation. Such verbs are eat and read whete the object 
is easily understood. But this phenomenon also occurs with other asso-

The next item tells us whether a verb is  an actioz? verb or not  
(SACTION). Action verbs and adjectives can appear in imperative 
sentences but  non-action verbs and ad jec t ives  cannot.

The next item te l ls  us whether 1he verb allows a regular passive 
o r  not. Only thobe whlch do not  al low a passfve a r e  marked. Apresyan,

a l l y  t h i s  w i l l  probably be computable from other  information i n  t h e  entry. 
Some important items apply only t o  verbs t h a t  take s e n t e n t i a l  com- 
plements. This includes  t h e  complementizer(s) the verb takes  and whether 
o r  no t  it allows not- t ransporta t ion.  The poss ib le  complementizers are* 
]CHAT Mother said t h a t  Mike should move, 
FORT0 Mother told Mike t o  move. 
75 
TNG Mother d id  not like Mike's sitting there, 
FROM Mothex prevented Mike from going. 
Verbs like t?z$nk whfch give us roughly synonymous sentences whetheq 
not i s  i n  the main clause or the subordinate clause are said t o  penbit 
not- transportation. 
John didn ' t think Mary had gone. 
John thought Mary hadnq t gone. 
Many verbs do not permit not-transportatzon, of course. These sew 
tences are not  synonymoust 
John d i d n ' t  say that Mary had gone. 
John said that Mary hadn' t gone. 
This complementizer infomafiod is coded by adding to the entry: THAT, 
FORTO, ING,   FRO^, or NOT, as appropriate. 
The next item is  the imp1icati;onal structure of the verb. There 
are seven such verb-classes and an eighth wastebasket class from which 
no inferences can be made (Joshi and Weischedel 1973; Karttunen 1930; 
Kiparsky and Kiparsky 1970) ; sbe t a b l e  3.  In this system f actives are 
the unmarked qase since we always  assume that we can assert arguments 
unless w e  are e x p l i c i t l y  told not to. The lexicql entry for each verb 
which can take a predicate complement and which is not a factive is not 
a fact ive  i s  marked with its class name. Eaoh class name appears in 
the lexicon with its appropriate inference pattern. For a negative-if 
verb, for example, t h i s  is : 
If R(V,Z1,s) can be asserted then S can b e  denied. 
If R(~ot (V)) Z1,S) can be assertzed then S is i n  limbo.

CopuZa Verbs: These are marked as verbs of perception o r  verbs of 
motion as appropr ia te  i f  they are no t  of the 'be-become-seem' va r i e ty .  
Verbs of perception are marked with the perceptual  sthere. This helps 
t o  construct  appropr ia te  semantic representa t ioas .  There is a close 
r ~ l a t i o n  between the following sentences and we need t o  make inferences  
from one t o  another. 
Sally listened t o  the trumpets. (active) 
Sally hea rd  the trumpets. (cogaitive) 
The trumpets sounded beaut i fu l  to Sally. ( f l i p p e d )  
The t h i r d  sentence is  called f l i p p e d  because i ts arguments are switched 
from those in the first two. Sowzd i s  the f l i p  perception verb f o r  hear 
dcf. Rogers 1972). Thus, the entry fo r  the copula verb Sound 1s marked: 
type - perception 
sphbre - aw?aZ 
f l i p  - h e  
Adjectives: The f irat s p e c i a l  item for an ad j ec t ive  i s  t h e  primi- 
t i v e  concept. For red it is coZor; far big and smaZZ it is  s ize .  
The second i t e m  is t h e  selection preference. For red it  is thing; 
for big it is t h h g ,  thought. The s e l e c t i o n  preference could probably 
be s t a t e d  once i n  t h e  en t ry  for the primit ive concept and not repeated. 
Since it is use fu l  t o  have it r ead i ly  available i n  pareing, i t  is  
included separately i n  every adjec t ive  entry. 
With adject jves  as with verbs w e  o f t e a  have causal ly  re la ted  homo- 
graphs. The z d m  i n  "warm coat" has a d i f f e r en t  meaning from the  
i n  "warm pie." A warm p i e  has a temperature greater  than room tempera- 
ture ,  but a warm coat makes you warm. These a r e  ca l l ed  warm and W~XPEI I 2 
land are connected by CAUSE u-. HOW does one recognize which is 
which? I f  the head noun is cZothing or  one of t he  'furnace-stove-oven' 
family o r  indeed anything else which has function heat, i s  assumed. 
Adjectives, l i k e  verbs, are marked 'Action - yes' o r  'Action - No' 
Lexical entries ?or adverbs are very much l i k e  those f o r  adjec t ives .  
The main s t ra tegy  rfollowed i n  the design of t he  l e x i c a l  entry has 
been t o  make i t  as compact as possible. It seems l i k e l y  that more in- 
formation w i l l  have t o  be added later. 
7. SUMMARY 
This lexicon 1s  designed t o  serve as the global data  base for a 
computer question answering system. It is therefore an in tegra ted  lexi -  
con-encyclopedia, s t o r ing  information needed for  parsing, for development 
of an i n t e r n a l  model, and 201; making inferences. Syntact ic  and semantic 
information a r e  integrated i n t o  each entry,  
Lexical e n t r i e s  a r e  provided Eof  a l l  words which appear i n  t h e  t e x t  
except f o r  those derived forms khose roots  can b e  recovered by a t r iv ia l  
computation. Thus t he re  are e n t r i e s  fo r  went and gone but not f o r  goes 
and go%ng, f o r  urnanted but not for wanted. Entr ies  are also provided 
f o r  some word combinations, such as birthday cake and thmtk yoy. Lexical 
erztries- a r e  tied together by lexical-semantic r e l a t i ons  which provide the 
in te rna l  structure df the  lexlcon. 
Relations present both p rac t i ca l  advantages and theore t i ca l  chams. 
The most immedfate prac t i ca l  advantages appear i n  the mechanisms fo r  
saving space. Relations allow us to  abbreviate entries, t o  state axiolr 
schemes once and produce par t i cu la r  axioms only when they a r e  needed, t o  
include se lec t ion  preferences i n  a compqct form. They a r e  i n  one sense 
a generalization of defining formulae already present i n  commercial 
dict ionaries .  Thus mere is  a poss ib i l i t y  t h a t  w e  can ex t r ac t  some 
re la t ion  values automatically f tom existing dic t ionar ies  (cf . Smith 
and M'axwell 1977). From a t h e ~ r e t i c a l ~ s t a n d p o i n t  r e la t ions  provide a 
model of l ex i ca l  memory with some modicum of psychd8gical  reality. 
Lexical-semantic r e l a t i ons  and the  theory of semantic f i e l d s  suggest 
a t en ta t ive  approach t o  the  problem of ident i fying the  context,  of 
f i-ding the  r i g h t  frame o r  s c r i p t .  
Appendkt I. The Swnuntic Representat<one. 
This i s  a sonewhat more formal descgiption of the  system of seman-: 
t i c  representations described informally in Section 5. (more details may 
be  found i n  M. Evens and G. Krulee, "Semantic Representations for Ques- 
t i on  -Answering Systems , " i n  preparation) . 
The representations are current ly  wr i t ten  i n  a many-sorted f i r s t  
order predicate calculus  with indivfdual constants and var iab les ,  function 
constants,  and a predicate  constant.  
(1) Individual constants of each sor t .  
The object  constants ate ~ i t r e n  XI, X2 .... 
Each corresponds t o  a unique object  i n  the s tory .  
(2) An i n f i n i t e  1 i ~ t  of var iab les  of each sort. 
The objec t  v a r i a b l e s  are w r i t t e n  ZX1,ZX2, . . a 
When w e  do not  wigh t o  speci fy  the s o r t  of a v a r i a b l e  i t  
is l abe l l ed  Z1, Z2, .... 
(3) Function cbnstants  Ncom and Nprop. 
These a r e  used t o  name objec ts .  
Ncom: Common nouns X objects + names 
Ncom (boy, X1) The boy went home. 
Nprop: proper nouns X ob jec t s  -+ names 
Nprop (Anne, Xp ) Anne went home. 
(4) A. Function cons tant  R a f ive-plac e  funct ion  
R i s  used to represent  c lauses  wi th  nbncopula verbs.  
R: noncopula verbs X o b j e c t s  X ob j ec t s  X ob jez t s

The boy hit Anne. 
Most of t h e  time t h i s  example w i l l  be abbreviated 
Unspecified arguments are o f t en  omitted f o r  convenience i n  wr i t ing .  
Within t h e  system they are represented by va r i ab l e s  and thus w i l l  match 
I1 anything. I f  t h e  s t o r y  says, Donna sang a song", t h e  i n t e r n a l  repre- 
s e n t a t i o n  i s  R(sing,X3,X4,Z1,Zq) with Nprop(l)onna,X3) and flcom(song,X4). 
The question: "Did .donna sing?" becoines R(sing,X3,Zg,Z4,Z5) which 
matches the statement from the story. 
B. Function constant P a three-place function 
P is used to  represent expressions with adjectives 
and adverbs. 
P: p r i m i t i v e  concepts X objects X m o d i f i e r s 4  properties 
relations 
properties 
interrelations 
names 
P (manner ,XI, kind) The boy i s  kind. 
The k ind  boy. 
C .  Function constant I a three-place function 
I i s  used to  represent expressions with conjunctions 
and con j unc t ive adverbs. 
I: interrelational X objects X obj ects + interrelations 
operato'rs relations r e l a t i ~ n s  
properties proper ties 
interrelations,inte;rrelations 
names names 
modifiers modifiers 
nand ,Xp ,XI) Anne and the boy. 
Anne smiZed bscaube the 
ZaoeJZdd. 
D. Function constant h e p  a two-place function 
Rrep is uged to present prepositional phrases. 
Prep: preposition X objects -+ modifiers 
relations 
properties 
interrelations 
t o  Anne 
E. Fuhction constants + * X two-place functions 
These functions rep~esent arithmetic operations. 
+: objects X a b j e c t s 4  objects 
*

F. Function con8tant Not a one-place function 
Not: aoncopula verbs ' noncopula vkrbs 
modifiers + modifiers 
interrelatibnal operators * interrelational 
operators 
RINot(sing) ,X2) 4 Anne d id  not sing. 
R(sing,I(Not(or),X2,X1)) Neither Anne nor 
the boy ;ang. 
(5) Predicate constant H d d s .  
This app l i e s  to every sentence at the top level. 
It represents the underlying performative in the narrative 
~ o z d s ( R ,  ) where asserts : Artne sees the 
boy ea t .  
Relations often appear as arguments of properties. 
P (manner ,R2 ,hungrily) f i e  boy eats hungrily 
PI = P (manner, x ~ ,  kind) The boy &I kind. 
The boy ie very kind. 
The notation ''PI =P(manner ,xl,kind)It merely indicates that 
P(manner,X ,kind) is the first property formed in the representation 
of  a particular story. 
Both doun and verb phrase complements are represented by writing 
the subordinate relation or propezty as an argument of the f orsn..la which 
represents the main clau* 
Relative clauses are represented as mterrelationsi. Clauses in- 
trodtced by relatlve pronouns are ordinarily treated as conjoined maln 
clauses. FOI adverbial clauses the conjunctive adverb serves as Qter- 
relational operator I(when, SI, SJ ) or I(becauae, Si, Sj  ) . 
Generic relatives and other types of gmeric expressions are treatutl 
as conditions, 
(6) b i s t s  and the Model of the Story World 
As the system reads the story it forms a model of the world 
the 5 t o ry  describes. The representations developed here are organized 
in five sepata t e  lists 
Lists of, I n d i v i ~ l s  
Lists of Names 
Liets of Relations 
Lists of Properties 
Lists of Interrelations 
We have defined the follQwing sorts.  For each sort ye have m e  
constants and an infinite supply of variables.
