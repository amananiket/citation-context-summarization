Most of  the work on natura l  language unders tand ing  (NLU) 
has been done on Eng l i sh .  E~ish  i s  a language wi th  re la t ive -  
l y  r ig id  word order ,  a character i s t i c  that  has in f luenced  a l l  
NLU systems proposed so fa r .  These systems have ded icated  on ly  
minor a t tent ion  to problems that  are  of  major  importance in  
lemguagee w i th  a f reer  o rder ing  l i ke  I ta l ian .  Work on pars ing  
par t ia l l y  un~ram~at ioal  sentences  in  r ig id  l ~ s  (Hayes 
and Mo~radtan, 1980l Charniak,  1981) bears  some s imi la r i ty  to  
work on p~rs ing of  " f ree"  o rder  language.  Tn both oases an 
exc lus ive ly  top-down model seems inappropr ia te .  For ins tance ,  
when cons ider ing  an incomplete  sentence  i t  may s t i l l  be adv is .  
ab le  to proceed in  bu i ld ing  some representat ion .  The resu l t -  
tng  s t ruc ture  w i l l  then be inser ted  w i th in  a la rger  oo~x i t ive  
s t ruc ture .  The sane bottom-up way of proceed?ng must necessa -  
r i l y  be par t  of  an NLU eyste~ fo r  " f ree"  o rder  languages .  
An ATN (Woods, 1970) type systaw, l i ke  the one developed 
fo r  Z ta l ian  (Cappe l l i  e ta l . ,  1978), shows de f in i te  l~n i ta t -  
ions even when i t  i s  fu rn i shed  wi th  heur i s t i cs  fo r  s t ra te~ 
se lec t ion  (Fer rar i  and 8took,  1980) based on adaptat ion  to  a 
coherent  text .  Other ideas  such as pass ing infox~nation in  the 
case o f  fa i lu re  (Weisohedel and Black,  1980) or  re lax ing  con-  
d i t ions  on aras  in  cer ta in  o i rotvastances (Kwasny and Sondhei -  
met,  1979) do not  seem to  be sat i s fy ing  so lu t ions  fo r  our 
px~bl~.

I n  o ther  hand, we do not agree that  syntax be g iven  a 
subord inate  ro le ,  as Schank's  theoret i ca l  approach imp l ies  
( though in  Schank and R iesbeck 's  parser ,  ELI (R iesbeck and 
Schank, 1978), syntax  has a more important  ro le  than would be 
expected) .  In  any event ,  wi thout  enough syntax i t  becomes hard 
to ana lyze complex sentences  and to exp la in  a number of  psycho-  
l ingu is t i c  phenomena. 
2.  WEDNESDAY, the system proposed here ,  i s  the  core  of  
an extended mechanism we are  deve lop ing  and implement ing in  
LISP (flg.1) (see Pariei and Castelfranchi, in press). It is 
an ana lyzer  wi th  semant ic  output  based on word in terpreta t ion .  
The semant ic  in fo rmat ion  brought in  by each word i s  p rogress -  
i ve ly  connected to get  at  the sentence 's  meaning accord ing  to  
syntact i c  const ra in ts  and expectat ions .  Syntax i s  a se t  o f  
ins t ruc t ions  d i rec t ly  concerned wi th  assembl ing  semant ic  un i t s .

What i s  character i s t i c  of  WEDNESDAY i s  that  syntax  i s  
not  a separate  component, but i s  d i s t r ibuted  throughout  the 
lex icon .  Lex ica l  ent r ies  are  composed of  a dec la ra t ive  par t  
and a procedura l  par t .  The procedura l  par t  i s  made up of  syn-  
tac t i c  ins t ruc t ions  des igned to assemble the dec la ra t ive  ( se -  
mant ic)  par t  of  the ent ry  w i th  the  dec la ra t ive  par ts  of  the 
o ther  words in  the  sentence .  The syntact i c  assembl ing  process  
- 66  - 
a l lows  the const ruc t ion  of the sentence 's  semantic  network to 
be car r ied  out p rogress ive ly  and so i t  can a l so  operate  on in -  
complete sentences .  Fur thermore,  the sys tem's  output  has a 
format which i s  homogenous to that  of  the knowledge base 
(encyc loped ia ) .  This  means that  as the  sentence  ana lys i s  pro -  
ceeds ,  i t  i s  natura l  to  have the knowledge base cont ro l l ing  
the assembly process  top-down, in  cooperat ion  wi th  the lex ioa l -  
-syntactic analysis. Clauses in multl-clause sentences are 
conce ived  as res t r i c ted  search  spaces fo r  the assembly ins t ruc~ 
t ions  car r ied  by the words, and the same i s  t rue  fo r  noun 
spaces (noun phrases) .  Par t -o f - speech  word categor ies  a re  
in terpreted  as procedures  fo r  opening and c los ing  spaces as a 
funct ion  of  context .  There fore ,  par t  of  the process  i s  depend- 
ent on a recurs ive  (push-down s torage)  mechanism. On the  o ther  
hand there  i s  a semant ic  sentence  memory that  i s  t ransparent  
to  the c losed- leve l  system.  
Being lex ica l ly  based,  WEDNESDAY can deal  in  a natura l  
way wi th  id iosyncras ies  typ ica l  of  many words. I t  can a l so  
dea l  w i th  f lex ib le  id ioms,  i .e .  id ioms that  can vary  in  morpho- 
logy ,  word order ,  syntact i c  const ruc t ion ,  semant ic  add i t ions ,  
and synonyms. The i r  reoo~i t ion  i s  governed by the ind iv idua l  
lex ica l  ent r ies  and takes  p lace at  +.he assembl ing leve l .  
Word d i sambiguat ion  i s  t reated  in  a non-determin is t i c  
way. Syntact i ca l l y  based d i sambiguat ion  (e .g .  the word J~)  
a t tempts  each read ing  of  an ambiguous word in  tu rn  and cance ls  
inappropr ia te  read ings  by tes t ing  them aga ins t  syntact i c  we l l -  
- formednese criteria. Encyclopaedia based disembiguation 
(e.g. the word b_~)  works through the activation of encyclo- 
paedic nodes by the words in the sentence. It selects that 
reading of an ambiguous word which activates the node "better" 
connected to the other activated nodes. It should be noted 
that, our approach, in comparison to Small?s work on Word 
Expert Parsing (Small, 1980), is characterized by (a) non- 
-determinism, (b) a more systematic recourse to syntax, (c) a 
separat ion  of  syntact i ca l l y  based word d i sambiguat ion  from 
encyc lopaed ia  based word d i sembiguat ion .
