We describe a workbench (XTAG)  for the development 
of tree-adjoining rammars and their parsers, and dis- 
cuss some issues that arise in the design of the graphical 
interface. 
Contrary to string rewriting grammars generating 
trees, the elementary objects manipulated by a tree- 
adjoining grammar are extended trees (i.e. trees of depth 
one or more) which capture syntactic information of lex- 
ical items. The unique characteristics of tree-adjoining 
grammars, its elementary objects found in the ~ lexicon 
(extended trees) and the derivational history of derived 
trees (also a tree), require a specially crafted interface in 
which the perspective has Shifted from a string-based to 
a tree-based system. XTAG provides such a graphical 
interface in which the elementary objects are trees (or 
tree sets) and not symbols (or strings). 
The kernel of XTA G is a predictive left to right parser 
for unification-based tree-adjoining rammar \[Schabes, 
1991\]. XTAG includes a graphical editor for trees, a 
graphical tree printer, utilities for manipulating and 
displaying feature structures for unification-based tree- 
adjoining grammar, facilities for keeping track of the 
derivational history of TAG trees combined with adjoin- 
ing and substitution, a parser for unification based tree- 
adjoining grammars, utilities for defining grammars and 
lexicons for tree-adjoining rammars, a morphological 
recognizer for English (75 000 stems deriving 280 000 in- 
flected forms) and a tree-adjoining grammar for English 
that covers a large range of linguistic phenomena. 
Considerations of portability, efficiency, homogeneity 
and ease of maintenance, lead us to the use of Common 
Lisp without its object language addition and to the use 
of the X Window interface to Common Lisp (CLX) for 
the implementation of XTAG.  
XTA G without the large morphological nd syntactic 
lexicons is public domain software. The large morpho- 
logical and syntactic lexicons can be obtained through 
an agreement with ACL's Data Collection Initiative.

1 In t roduct ion  
Tree-adjoining grammar (TAG) \[Joshi et al, 1975; Joshi, 
1985; Joshi, 1987\] and its lexicalized variant \[Schabes et 
al., 1988; Schabes, 1990; Joshi and Schabes, 1991\] are 
tree-rewriting systems in which the syntactic properties 
of words are encoded as tree structured-objects of ex- 
tended size. TAG trees can be combined with adjoining 
and substitution to form new derived trees. 1
Tree-adjoining rammar differs from more traditional 
tree-generating systems uch as context-free grammar in 
two ways: 
1. The objects combined in a tree-adjoining grammar 
(by adjoining and substitution) are trees and not 
strings. In this approach, the lexicon associates with 
a word the entire structure it selects (as shown in 
Figure 1) and not just a (non-terminal) symbol as 
in context-free grammars. 
2. Unlike string-based systems such as context-free 
grammars, two objects are built when trees are com- 
bined: the resulting tree (the derived tree) and its 
derivational history (the derivation tree). 2 
These two unique characteristics of tree-adjoining 
grammars, the elementary objects found in the lexicon 
(extended trees) and the distinction between derived tree 
and its derivational history (also a tree), require a spe- 
cially crafted interface in which the perspective must 
be shifted from a string-based to a tree-based system. 
1We assume familiarity throughout the paper with the 
definition of TAGs. See the introduction by Joshi \[1987\] 
for an introduction to tree-adjoining grammar. We refer the 
reader to Joshi \[1985\], Joshi \[1987\], Kroch and Joshi \[1985\], 
Abeill~ et al \[1990a\], Abeill~ \[1988\] and to Joshi and Schabes 
\[1991\] for more information on the linguistic characteristics 
of TAG such as its lexicalization and factoring recursion out 
of dependencies. 
2The TAG derivation tree is the basis for semantic inter- 
pretation \[Shieber and Schabes, 1990b\], generation \[Shieber 
and Schabes, 1991\] and machine translation \[Abeill~ et al, 
1990b\] since the information given in this data-structure is 
richer than the one found in the derived tree. Furthermore, 
it is at the level of the derivation tree that ambiguity must 
be defined.

Figure 1: Elementary trees found in a tree-adjoining 
grammar lexicon 
XTA G provides such a graphical interface in which the 
elementary objects are trees (or tree sets) and not sym- 
bols (or strings of symbols). 
Skeletons of such workbenches have been previously 
realized on Symbolics machines \[Schabes, 1989; Schif- 
ferer, 1988\]. Although they provided some insights on 
the architectural design of a TAG workbench, they were 
never expanded to a full fledged natural anguage nvi- 
ronment because of inherent limitations (such as their 
lack of portability). 
XTAG runs under Common Lisp \[Steele, 1990\] and it 
uses the Common LISP X Interface (CLX) to access the 
graphical primitives defined by the Xl l  protocol. XTAG 
is portable across machines and Common Lisp compilers. 
The kernel of XTA G is a predictive left to right parser 
for unification-based tree-adjoining rammar \[Schabes, 
1991\]. The system includes the following components 
and features: 
? Graphical edition of trees. The graphical display of 
a tree is the only representation f a tree accessible 
to the user. Some of the operations that can be 
performed graphically on trees are: 
- Add and edit nodes. 
- Copy, paste, move or delete subtrees. 
- Combine two trees with adjunction or substitu- 
tion. These operations keep track of the deriva- 
tional history and update attributes tated in 
form of feature structures as defined in the 
framework of unification-based tree-adjoining 
grammar \[Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1988\]. 
- View the derivational history of a derived tree 
and its components (elementary trees). 
? A tree display module for efficient and aesthetic for- 
matting of a tree based on a new tree display algo- 
rithm \[Chalnick, 1989\]. The algorithm is an im- 
provement of the ones developed by R.eingold and 
Tolford \[1981\] and, Lee \[1987\]. It guarantees in lin- 
ear time that tress which are structural mirror im- 
ages of on another are drawn such that their dis- 
plays are reflections of one another while achieving 
minimum width of the tree. 
? Capabilities for grouping trees into sets which can 
be linked to a file. This is particularly useful since 
lexicalized TAGs organize trees into tree-families 
which capture all variations of a predicative lexical 
item for a given subcategorization frame. 
? Utilities for editing and processing equations for 
unification based tree-adjoining rammar \[Vijay- 
Shanker and \]oshi, 1988; Schabes, 1990\]. 
? A predictive left to right parser for unification-based 
tree-adjoining grammar \[Schabes, 1991\]. 
? Utilities for defining a grammar (set of trees, set of 
tree families, set of lexicons) which the parser uses. 
? Morphological exicons for English \[Karp et al, 
1992\] 
? A tree-adjoining grammar for English that covers a 
large range of linguistic phenomena. 
2 XTAG Components  
The communication with the user is centralized around 
the interface manager window (See Figure 2) which gives 
the user control over the different modules of XTAG.

Figure 2: Manager Window. 
This window displays the contents of the tree buffers 
currently loaded into the system. The different functions 
of XTAG are available by means of a series of pop-up 
menus associated to buttons, and by means of mouse 
actions performed on the mouse-sensitive it ms (such as 
the tree buffer names and the tree names). 
224
A tree editor for a tree contained in one of the tree 
buffer contained in the window can be called up by click- 
ing over its tree name. Each tree editor manages one tree 
and as many tree editors as needed can run concurrently. 
For example, Figure 2 holds a set of files (such 
as Tnx0Vsl.trees) 3 which each contain trees (such as 
anx0Vsl) .  When this tree is selected for editing, the 
window shown in Figure 3 is displayed. Files can be 
handled independently or in group, in which case they 
form a tree family (flag F next to a buffer name).

Figure 3: A tree-editing window for the tree anx0Vsl.  
All the editing and visualizing operations are per- 
formed through this window (see Figure 3). Some of 
them are: 
? Add and edit nodes. 
? Copy, paste, move or delete subtrees. 
? Combine two trees with adjunction or substitu- 
tion. These operations keep track of the deriva- 
tional history and update attributes tated in form 
of feature structures as defined in the framework 
of unification-based tree-adjoining grammar \[Vijay- 
Shanker and Joshi, 1988\]. 
? View the derivational history of a derived tree and 
its components (elementary trees). 
? Display and edit feature structures. 
? Postscript printing of the tree. 
3The particular conventions for the tree and family names 
reflect the structure of the trees and they can be ignored by 
the reader. 
XTAG uses a centralized clipboard for all binary op- 
erations on trees (all operations are either unary or bi- 
nary). These operations (such as paste, adjoin or substi- 
tute) are always performed between the tree contained 
in XTAG's clipboard and the current tree. The contents 
of the clipboard can be displayed in a special view-only 
window. 
The request o view the derivational history of a tree 
result of a combining operation triggers the opening of a 
view-only window which displays the associated eriva- 
tion tree. Each node in a derivation tree is mouse- 
sensitively linked to an elementary tree. 
Since the derivational history of a derived tree depends 
on the elementary trees which were used to build it, 
inconsistency in the information displayed to the user 
could arise if the user attempts to modify an elementary 
tree which is being used in a derivation. This problem is 
solved by ensuring that, whenever a modifying operation 
is requested, full consistency is maintained between all 
the views. For instance, editing a tree used in a deriva- 
tion tree will break the link between those two. Thus 
consistency is maintained between the derived tree and 
the derivation tree. 
Figure 4 shows an example of a derived tree (leftmost 
window) with its derivation tree window (middle win- 
dow) and an elementary tree participating in its deriva- 
tion (rightmost window). 
As is shown in Figure 3, the tree display module 
handles the bracketed isplay of feature structures (in 
unification-based TAG, each node is associated two fea- 
ture structures: top and bottom, see Vijay-Shanker and 
Joshi \[1988\] for more details). The tree formatting al- 
gorithm guarantees that trees that are structural mirror 
images of on another are drawn such that their displays 
are reflections of one another \[Chalnick, 1989\]. A unifi- 
cation module handles the updating of feature structures 
for TAG trees. 
XTAG includes a predictive left to right parser 
for unification-based tree-adjoining rammar \[Schabes, 
1991\]. The parser is integrated into XTAG and deriva- 
tions are displayed by the interface as illustrated in Fig- 
ure 4. The parser achieves an O(G~n6)-time worst case 
behavior, O(G2n4)-time for unambiguous grammars and 
linear time for a large class of grammars. The parser 
uses the following two-pass parsing strategy (originally 
defined for lexicalized grammars \[Schabes et al, 1988\]) 
which improves its performance in practice \[Schabes and 
Joshi, 1990\]: 
? In the first step the parser will select, the set of 
structures corresponding to each word in the sen- 
tence. Each structure can be considered as encoding 
a set of 'rules'. 
? In the second step, the parser tries to see whether 
these structures can be combined to obtain a well- 
formed structure. In particular, it puts the struc- 
tures corresponding to arguments into the struc- 
tures corresponding to predicates, and adjoins, it 
needed, the auxiliary structures corresponding to 
adjuncts to what they select (or are selected) for. 
This step is performed with the help of a chart in 
the fashion of Earley-style parsing.

The first step enables the parser to select a relevant 
subset of the entire grammar, since only the structures 
associated with the words in the input string are selected 
for the parser. The number of structures filtered during 
this pass depends on the nature of the input string and 
on characteristics of the grammar such as the number 
of structures, the number of lexical entries, the degree 
of lexical ambiguity, and the languages it defines. In the 
second step, since the structures selected uring the first 
step encode the morphological value of their words (and 
therefore their position in the input string), the parser 
is able to use non-local bottom-up information to guide 
its search. The encoding of the value of the anchor of 
each structure constrains the way the structures can be 
combined. This information is particularly useful for a 
top-down component of the parser \[Schabes and Joshi, 
1990\]. 
XTAG provides all the utilities required for designing 
a lexicalized TAG structured as in Schabes et al \[1988\]. 
All the syntactic oncepts of lexicalized TAG (such as the 
grouping of the trees in tree families which represents he 
possible variants on a basic subcategorization frame) are 
accessible through mouse-sensitive items. Also, all the 
operations required to build a grammar (such as load 
trees, define tree families, load syntactic and morpho- 
logical lexicon) can be predefined with a macro-like lan- 
guage whose instructions can be loaded from a file (See 
Figure 5). 
The grammar writer has also the option to manually 
test a derivation by simulating adjoining or substitution 
of trees that are associated with words defined in the 
lexicon. 
The grammar consists of a morphological English an- 
alyzer and a syntactic lexicon, which is the domain of 
structural choice, subcategorization a d selectional in- 
formation. Lexical items are defined by the tree struc- 
ture or the set of tree structures they select.

Figure 5: An example of instructions for loading and 
defining a grammar. 
The morphological lexicons for English \[Karp el al., 
1992\] were built with PC-KIMMO's implementation of
two-level morphology \[Antworth, 1990\] and with the 
1979 edition of Collins English Dictionary. They com- 
prise 75 000 stems deriving 280 000 inflected forms. 
XTAG also comes with a tree-adjoining grammar for 
English \[Abeill@ et al, 1990a\] which covers a large range 
of linguistic phenomena. 
The entries for lexical items of all types belong to the 
syntactic lexicon and are marked with features to con- 
strain the form of their arguments. For example, a verb 
which takes a sentential argument uses features to con- 
strain the form of the verb acceptable in the complement 
clause. An interesting consequence of TAG's extended 
226
domain of locality is that features imposed by a clausal 
lexical item can be stated directly on the subject node 
as well as on the object node. These features need not 
be percolated through the VP node as in context-free 
formalisms. 
When a word can have several structures, correspond- 
ing to different meanings, it is treated as several exical 
items with different entries in the syntactic lexicon. Mor- 
phologically, such items can have the same category and 
the same entry in the morphological lexicon 4. Examples 
of syntactic entries follow: 5

3 The  cho ice  o f  a graph ica l  package:  X 
Window and CLX 
The choice of a graphical package was motivated by con- 
siderations of portability, efficiency, homogeneity and 
ease of maintenance. XTAG was built using Common 
Lisp and its X Window interface CLX. 
We chose this rather low level approach to realize the 
interface as opposed to the use of a higher-level toolkit 
for graphic interface design because the rare tools avail- 
able which were fulfilling our requirements for portabil- 
ity, homogeneity and ease of maintenance were still un- 
der development a the beginning of the design of XTA G. 
The first package we considered was Express Window. 
It attracted our attention because it has precisely been 
created to run programs developed on the Symbolics ma- 
chine in other Common Lisp environments. It is an im- 
plementation of most of the Flavors and graphic prim- 
itives of the Symbolics system respectively in terms of 
the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS) \[Keene, 1988\] 
primitives and CLX \[Scheifler and Lamott, 1989\]. We 
4The lexical entries below have been simplified for the 
purpose of exposition. 
5Syntactic lexicons can be stated in various forms. In 
the following examples, a tree family is associated with each 
string of part of speeches (POS). 
did not use it mainly because it was known to work only 
with the PCL version from Xerox Parc (we want to re- 
main as compatible as possible between the different di- 
alects of Common Lisp), and was not robust enough. 
Although WINTERP has many interesting points for 
our purpose, we did not choose it because we wanted 
to have a complete and efficient (i.e. a compiler) Com- 
mon Lisp implementation. WINTERP is an interpre- 
tive, interactive nvironment for rapid prototyping and 
application writing using the OSF Motif toolkit \[Young, 
1990\]. It uses a mini-lisp interpreter (called XLISP; it is 
not available as a compiler) to glue together various C- 
implemented primitive operations (Xlib \[Nye, 1988\] and 
Xtk \[Asente and Swick, 1990\]) in a Smalltalk-like \[Gold- 
berg, 1983\] object system (widgets are a first class type). 
WINTERP has no copyright restrictions. 
Initially we were attracted by GARNET \[Meyers et al, 
1990\], mainly because it is advertised as look-and-feel 
independent and because it is implemented using only 
Common Lisp and CLX (but not CLOS, nor any existing 
X toolkit such as Xtk or Motif). The system is composed 
of two parts: (1) a toolkit offering objects (prototype 
instance model \[Lieberman, 1986\], constraints, (2) and 
an automatic run-time maintenance of properties of the 
graphic objects based on a semantic network. The dif- 
ferent behavior of the interface components i specified 
by binding high level interactors objects to the graphic 
objects. An interface builder tool (Lapidary) allows the 
drawing of the graphic aspects of an interface. How- 
ever we did not use GARNET because the version at 
the time of the design of XTAG was very large and slow, 
and still subject to changes of design. Furthermore, an- 
other reason for not choosing GARNET was the fact 
that Carnegie Mellon University retained the copyrights, 
slowing the distribution. 
PICASSO \[Schank et al, 1990\], a more recent pack- 
age from Berkeley University, offers similar functionali- 
ties shared by other non Common Lisp based applica- 
tion frameworks like InterViews \[Linton et al, 1989\], 
MacApp \[Schmuker, 1986\] and Smalltalk \[Goldberg, 
1983\], but is freely distributed. It is an object-oriented 
system implemented in Common Lisp, CLX and CLOS. 
With each type of PICASSO object is associated a CLOS 
class, the instances of which have different graphic and 
interactive properties. The widgets implementing those 
properties are automatically created uring the creation 
of a PICASSO object. Unlike the two previous sys- 
tems, the PICASSO objects may be shared in an ex- 
ternal database common to different applications (per- 
sistent classes) when this is enabled, PICASSO requires 
the use of the database management system INGRES 
\[Charness and Rowe, 1989\]. PICASSO was not available 
as a released package at the time the implementation of 
XTA G started. 
4 P rogramming cons iderat ions  
All the graphic objects of XTAG are defined as con- 
tacts and are implemented using only the structures of 
Common Lisp and their simple inheritance mechanism. 
Because of the relatively low computing cost associated 
with the contacts, we have been able to define every 
227
graphic object of XTAG (whatever its complexity as a 
contact is) without having to resort to a different proce- 
dure oriented implementation for simpler objects as was 
done in InterViews with the painter objects \[Linton et 
al., 1989\]. 
The programming difficulties we have encountered 
deal with re-synchronizing XTAG with the server during 
a transfer of control between contacts (the active con- 
tact is the one containing the cursor). These difficulties 
stem from the asynchronous nature of the communica- 
tion protocol of X and from the large number of events 
mouse motion may generate when the cursor is moved 
over closely located windows. The fact that windows 
may be positioned anywhere and stacked in any order 
(overlapping windows) makes the handling of those tran- 
sitions a non trivial task. A careful choice of the event- 
masks attached to the windows is by itself insufficient to 
solve the problem. To limit the number of queries made 
to the server, we use extensive caching of graphic prop- 
erties. The structures implementing the contacts con- 
tain fields that duplicate server information. They are 
updated when the graphic properties of the object they 
describe are changed. We found this strategy to improve 
the performance noticeably. This feature can easily be 
turned off, in case a particular X-terminai or workstation 
would provide hardware support for caching. 
While we put a lot of attention on issue of portabil- 
ity, we did not worry about look independence, limiting 
the user possibilities in this domain to geometric dimen- 
sion parameterization a d font selection by means of a 
configuration file and a few menus. 
Our current implementation uses the twin window 
manager, but another window manager could also be 
used. We have found the need for multi-font string sup- 
port for XTAG because the tree names and node labels 
require a mix of at least two or three fonts (ascii sym- 
bols and greek symbols uch as c~, fl and e, and a font for 
subscripts). We could have used a font which contains 
all the characters may use the same font as the normal 
differ from those only by their location to the writing 
line), but we preferred to define a multi-font composed 
of several existing fonts (which can be customized by the 
user) for portability purposes and to leave open the way 
for future extensions. 
In order to be able to scroll over the trees when they 
are too big to be displayed in a window, every tree editor 
window is associated with an eight direction touch-pad 
(inspired from the mover of InterViews \[Linton et al, 
1989\]). 
The nodes displayed in the window of a tree editor 
are not sensitive to the presence of the cursor, they re- 
act only to mouse button clicks. During earlier versions 
of XTAG we highlighted the visited node with a border, 
but this required too much overhead because of the nu- 
merous cursor motions over the tree window which occur 
during editing. 
The text editing task we had to implement fall into 
two classes: 
? short line editing requiring multi-fonts (e.g. edition 
of node names); 
? text editing not requiring multi-fonts (e.g. multi- 
line comments, unification equations). 
For the former, we implemented all the editing func- 
tions ourselves because they do not require much pro- 
cessing and multi-font support was unavailable. For the 
latter, we used system calls to an external editor (emacs 
in our case). 
Concerning the programming task, we would have 
liked to have available tools to help us write an X ap- 
plication in Common Lisp at a level slightly higher than 
the one of the CLX interface without going up to the 
level of elaborate toolkits like GARNET or PICASSO 
which implies the use of a complex infra-structure, per- 
haps something like an incremental or graded toolkit. 
Our next developments effort will be concerned with 
introducing parallelism in the interface (actors), adding 
new features like an undo mechanism (using the Item 
list data structure proposed by Dannenberg \[1990\]), and 
extending XTAG for handling meta-rules \[Becker, 1990\] 
and Synchronous TAGs \[Shieber and Schabes, 1990b\] 
which are used for the purpose of automatic trans-

5 Requ i rements  fo r  Runn ing  XTAG 
Version 0.93 of XTAG is available as pub/xtagO. 93.tar.Z 
by anonymous ftp to linc.cis.upenn.edu (130.91.6.8). 6 
XTA G requires: 
? A machine running UNIX and Xl lR4.  7 
? A Common Lisp compiler which supports the latest 
definition of Common Lisp \[Steele, 1990\]. Although 
XTAG should run under a variety of lisp compil- 
ers, it has only been tested with LUCID Common 
Lisp 4.0 and Allegro Common Lisp 4.0.1. A version 
running under KCL is currently under development. 
? Common Lisp X Interface (CLX) version 4 or 
higher .s 
XTAG has been tested on UNIX based machines 
(R4.4) (SPARC station 1, SPARC station SLC, HP 
BOBCATs series 9000 and SUN 4 also with NCD X- 
terminals) running X l lR4 and CLX with Lucid Com- 
mon Lisp (4.0) and Allegro Common Lisp (4.0.1). 
6 Conc lus ion  
We described a workbench for the development of tree- 
adjoining grammars and their parsers and discussed 
some issues that arise in the design of the graphic in- 
terface. 
The unique characteristics of tree-adjoining ram- 
mars, its elementary objects found in the lexicon (ex- 
tended trees) and the derivational history of derived 
6Newer versions of the system are copied into the same 
directory as they become available. 
rPrevious releases of X will not work with XTAG. X11R4 
is free software available from MIT. 
8CLX is the Common Lisp equivMent to the Xlib package 
for C. It allows the lisp programmer to use the graphical 
primitives of Xlib within Common Lisp.

trees (also a tree), require a specially crafted interface 
in which the perspective is shifted from a string-based 
to a tree-based system. XTAG provides such a work- 
bench. 
The kernel of XTA G is a predictive left to right parser 
for unification-based tree-adjoining rammar \[Schabes, 
1991\]. XTAG includes a graphical editor for trees, a 
graphical tree printer based on a new algorithm, utili- 
ties for manipulating and displaying feature structures 
for unification-based tree-adjoining rammar, facilities 
for keeping track of the derivational history of TAG trees 
combined with adjoining and substitution, a parser for 
unification based tree-adjoining rammars, utilities for 
defining grammars and lexicons for tree-adjoining gram- 
mars, a morphological recognizer for English (75 000 
stems deriving 280 000 inflected forms) and a tree- 
adjoining grammar for English that covers a large range 
of linguistic phenomena. 
XTAG without the large morphological nd syntactic 
lexicons is public domain software. The large morpho- 
logical and syntactic lexicons can be obtained through 
an agreement with ACL's Data Collection Initiative. 
XTAG runs under Common Lisp and X Window 
(CLX). 
Acknowledgments  
Many people contributed to the development of XTAG. 
We are especially grateful to Mark Liberman for his 
help with the extraction of morphological nd syntactic 
information available in the data collected by the ACL's 
Data Collection Initiative. 
We have benefitted from discussions with Evan 
Antworth, Lauri Karttunen, Anthony Kroch, Fernando 
Pereira, Stuart Shieber and Annie Zaenen. 
Anne Abeille, Kathleen Bishop, Sharon Cote, Beat- 
rice Daille, Jason Frank, Caroline Heycock, Beth Ann 
Hockey, Megan Moser, Sabine Petillon and Raffaella 
Zanuttini contributed to the design of the English and 
French TAG grammars. 
The morphological lexicons for English were built by 
Daniel Karp. 
Patrick Martin automated the acquisition of some of 
syntactic lexicons with the use of on-line dictionaries. 
We would like to thank Jeff Aaronson, Tilman Becker, 
Mark Foster, Bob Frank, David Magerman, Philip 
Resnik, Steven Shapiro, Martin Zaidel and Ira Winston 
for their help and suggestions.
