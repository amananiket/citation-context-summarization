ABSTRACT 
Heuristic parsing is the art of doing parsing 
in a haphazard and seemingly careless manner but 
in such a way that the outcome is still "good", at 
least from a statistical point of view, or, hope- 
fully, even from a more absolute point of view. 
The idea is to find s t rateg ic  shortcuts  der ived 
from guesses about the structure of a sentence 
based on scanty observat ions  of linguistic units 
In the sentence. If the guess comes out right much 
pars ing t ime can be saved, and if it does not, 
many subobservat ions  may st i l l  be val id for re- 
v ised guesses. In the (very pre l iminary)  exper i -  
ment reported here the main idea is to make use of 
( combinat ions  of) surface phenomena as much as 
poss ib le  as the base for the pred ic t ion  of the 
s t ructure  as a whole. In the parser to be deve- 
loped along the lines sketched in this report main 
s t ress  is put on ar r iv ing  at independent ly  
working, parallel recognition procedures. 
The work reported here Is both aimed at simu- 
lat lng cer ta in  aspects of human language per- 
cept ion  and at ar r iv ing  at e f fect ive  a lgor i thms 
for actual  pars ing of running text. There is, 
indeed, a great need for fast such a lgor i thms,  
e.g. for the analysis of the literally millions of 
words of running text that already today comprise 
the data bases in var ious large in fo rmat ion  re- 
t r ieval  systems,  and which  can be expected to 
expand several  orders of magn i tude  both in im- 
portance and In size In the foreseeable future. 
I BACKGROUND 
The genera ! idea behind the system for heu- 
ristic parsing now being developed at our group in 
S tockho lm dates more than 15 years back, when I 
was mak ing  an invest igat ion  (together wi th Hans 
Kar lgren,  Stockho lm)  of the poss ib i l i t ies  of 
using computers for information retrieval purposes 
for the Swedish Governmental Board for Rationali- 
zat ion (Statskontoret).  In the course of this 
invest igat ion  we performed some psycholingulstic 
exper iments  a imed at f inding out to what extent 
sur face markers,  such as endings, prepos i t ions,  
con junct ions  and other (bound) e lements  from 
typ ica l ly  c losed categor ies  of linguistic units, 
could serve as a base for a syntactic analysis of 
sentences. We sampled a couple of texts more or 
less at random and prepared them in such a way 
that stems of nouns, adjectives and (main) verbs - 
these categor ies  being thought of as the main 
carriers of semantic Information - were substi- 
tuted for by a mere "-", whereas other formatives 
were left in their original shape and place. These 
transformed texts were presented to subjects who 
were  asked to fill in the gaps in such a way that 
the texts thus obtained were to be both syntacti- 
cally correct and reasonably coherent. 
The result of the exper iment  was rather 
astonishing. It turned out that not only were the 
syntactic structures mainly restored, in some few 
cases also the original content was reestablished, 
a lmost  word by word. (It was beyond any poss i -  
bility that the subjects could have had access to 
the original text.) Even in those cases when the 
text i tsel f  was not restored to this remarkab le  
extent, the stylistic value of the var ious texts 
was almost invariably reestablished; an originally 
l ively, narrat ive  story came out as a l ively, 
nar rat ive  story , and a piece of rather dull, 
factual  text (from a school  text book on socio-  
logy) invariably came out as dull, factual prose. 
This experiment showed quite clearly that at 
least for Swedish the information contained in the 
combinat ions  of surface markers  to a remarkab ly  
high degree ref lects  the syntact ic  s t ructure  of 
the or ig ina l  text; in a lmost  all cases also the 
s ty l i s t ic  value and in some few cases even the 
semant ic  content  was kept. (The extent to wh ich  
this is true is probably language dependent; Swe- 
dish is rather rich in morpho logy,  and this 
property is certainly a contributing factor for an 
experiment of this type to come out successful to 
the extent it actually did.) 
This type of exper iment  has since then been 
repeated many times by many scholars; in fact, it 
ls one of the standard ways to demonst ra te  the 
concept of redundancy in texts. But there are 
several other important conclusions one could draw 
from this type of exper iments .  F irst  of all, of 
course, the obvious conc lus ion  that sur face 
s ignals  do carry a lot of in fo rmat ion  about the 
s t ructure  of sentences,  probably  much more than 
one has been inclined to think, and, consequently, 
It could be wor th  wh i le  to try to capture that 
In fo rmat ion  in some kind of automat ic  analys is  
system. This is the pract ica l  side of it. But 
there is more to it. One must ask the question why 
a language llke Swedish is llke this. What are the 
theoretical implications? 
Much Interest has been devoted in later years 
to theor ies (and speculat ions)  about human per- 
66 
ception of linguistic stimuli, and I do not think 
that one speculates  too much if one assumes that 
surface markers  of the type that appeared in the 
descr ibed exper iment  together  const i tute  im- 
portant  clues concern ing the gross syntact ic  
structure of sentences (or utterances), clues that 
are probably much less consiously perceived than, 
e.g., the actual  words in the sentences /ut teran-  
ces. To the extent that such clues are actua l ly  
perce ived they are obv ious ly  perce ived s imul ta -  
neous ly  with, i.e. in para l le l  with, other units 
(words, for instance). 
The above way of looking upon perception as a 
set of independent ly  operat ing  processes is, of 
course, more or less generally accepted nowadays 
(cf., e.g., L indsay-Norman 1977), and it is also 
genera l ly  accepted in computat iona l  linguistics 
that any program that a ims at s imu la t ing  per- 
cept ion in one way or other must  have features 
that s imulates  (or, even better, actual ly  per- 
forms) para l le l  processing,  and the analys is  
system to be described below has much emphasis on 
exactly this feature. 
Another  common saying nowadays  when dis- 
cussing parsing techniques is that one should try 
to incorporate "heur ist ic  devices" (cf., e.g., 
the many subreports  related to the big ARPA- 
project  concern ing Speech Recognition and Under- 
standing 1970-76), a l though there does not seem 
to exist a very precise consensus of what exactly 
that would  mean. (In mathemat ics  the term has 
been t rad i t iona l ly  used to refer to in formal  
reasoning, espec ia l ly  when used in c lassroom 
situations. In a famous study the hungar ian  
mathemat ic ian Polya, 1945 put forth the thesis 
that heur is t ics  is one of the most important  
psycho log ica l  dr iv ing mechan isms behind mathe-  
mat ica l  - or sc ient i f i c  - progress. In AI- 
l i terature it is often used to refer to shortcut 
search methods in semant ic  networks/spaces; c.f. 
Lenat, 1982). 
One reason for trying to adopt some kind of 
heur is t ic  device in the analys is  procedures is 
that one for mathemat ica l  reasons knows that 
ordinary, "careful", parsing algorithms inherently 
seem to refuse to work in real t ime (i.e. in 
linear time), whereas human beings, on the whole, 
seem to be able to do exact ly  that (i.e. perceive 
sentences or utterances simultaneously with their 
production). Parallel processing may partly be an 
answer  to that d i lemma,  but stil l , any process 
that c la ims to actual ly  s imulate  some part of 
human percept ion must in some way or other 
s imu la te  the remarkab le  abi l i t ies  human beings 
have in grasp ing complex  patterns ("gestalts") 
seemingly in one single operation. 
Ordinary, careful, pars ing a lgor i thms are 
o f ten  organ ized  accord ing  to some genera l  
pr inc ip le  such as "top-down", "bottom-to-top",  
"breadth  f i rst" ,  "depth  f i rst" ,  etc., these  
headings referr ing to some speci f ied type of 
"strategy". The heur ist ic  model  we are trying to 
work out has no such preconceived strategy built 
into  it. Our  ph i losophy  is ins tead  ra ther  
anarch is t ic  (The Heur is t i c  Principle): Whatever  
linguistic unit that can be identified at whatever 
stage of the analysis, according to whatever means 
there are, i_~s identified, and the significance of 
the fact that the unit in quest ion  has been 
identified is made use of in all subsequent stages 
of the analysis. At any time one must.be prepared 
to reconsider an already established analysis of a 
unit on the ground that ev idence a~alnst  the 
analysis may successively accumulate due to what 
analyses other units arrive at. 
In next sect ion we give a br ief  descr ip t ion  
of the  analys is  system for Swed ish  that is now 
under deve lopment  at our group in Stockholm. As 
has been said, much effort  is spent on try ing to 
make use of sur face s ignals  as much as possible. 
Not that we bel ieve that surface s ignals  play a 
more  impor tant  ro le  than  any  o ther  type of 
linguistic signals, but rather that we think it is 
important  to try to opt imize  each s ingle sub- 
p rocess  (in a para l le l  sys tem)  as much as 
~osslble,  and, as said, it might  be wor th  whi le  
to look careful  into this level, because the im- 
portance of surface signals might have been under- 
estimated in previous research. Our exneriments so 
far seem to indicate that they const i tute  ex- 
cel lent  units  to base heur is t ic  guesses on. An- 
other reason for concentrating our efforts on this 
level is that it takes time and requires much hard 
computat iona l  work  to get such an anarch is t ic  
system to really work, and this surface level is 
reasonably simple to handle. 
II AN OUTLINE OF AN ANALYZER BASED ON 
THE HEURISTIC PRINCIPLE 
F igure 1 be low shows the general  out l ine of 
the system. Each of the var ious boxes (or sub- 
boxes) represents one specific process, usually a 
complete computer program in itself, or, in some 
cases, independent processes within a program. The 
big "container", label led "The Pool", contains 
both the l inguist ic  mater ia l  as wel l  as the 
current  analys is  of it. Each program or process 
looks into the Pool for things "it" can recognize, 
and when the process finds anything it is trained 
to recognize,  it adds its observat ion  to the ma- 
terial in the Pool. This added material may (hope- 
fully) help other  processes in recogniz ing what 
they are trained to recognize,  wh ich  in its turn 
may again help the first process to recognize more 
of "its" units. And so on. 
The system is now under deve lopment  and 
during this build-up phase each process is, as was 
said above, essent ia l ly  a complete,  s tand-a lone 
module, and the Pool exists simply as successively 
updated text fi les on a disc storage. At the 
moment some programs presuppose that other prog- 
rams have a l ready been run, but this state of 
af fa i rs  wi l l  be val id Just dur ing this bu i ld~up 
phase. At the end of the bui ld-up phase each 
program shal l  be able to run complete ly  inde- 
pendent of any other program in the system and in 
arb i t rary  order  re lat ive to the others (but, of 
course, usually perform better if more information 
is available in the Pool). 
67 
In the ~econd phase superord inated  contro l  
p rograms are to be implemented .  These programs 
w i l l  funct ion  as "traff ic  rules" and via these 
systems one shall be able to test various strate- 
gies, i.e. to test wh ich  re lat ive order between 
the different subsystems that yields optimal re- 
suit  in some kind of "per formance metric", some 
eva luat ion  procedure that takes both speed and 
quality into account. 
The programs/processes shown in Figure i all 
represent  rather  s t ra ight fo rward  F in i te  State 
Pattern Matching (FS/PM) procedures. It is rather 
t r iv ia l  to show mathemat ica l ly  that a set of 
i n teract ing  FS/PM procedures of the type used in 
our sys tem together  wi l l  y ie ld a system that 
formally has the power of a CF-parser; in practice 
it w i l l  y ie ld a system that in some sense is 
stronger,  at least f rom the point  of v iew of 
convenience. Congruence and similar phenomena will 
be reduced to s imple  local observat ions.  Trans-  
fo rmat iona l  var iants  of sentences wi l l  be re- 
cognized d i rect ly  - there wi l l  be no need for 
performing some kind of backward transformational 
operat ions.  (In this respect a system llke this 
w i l l  resemble  Gazdar's g rammar  concept; Gazdar  
1980. ) 
The contro l  s t ructures  later to be super im-  
posed on the interacting FS/PM systems will also 
be of a F in i te State type. A sys tem of the type 
then obta ined - a sys tem of independent  F in i te  
State Automatons  contro l led  by another  F in i te  
State Automaton - will in principle have rather 
complex  mathemat ica l  propert ies.  It is, e.g., 
rather easy to see that such a system has stronger 
capac i ty  than a Type 2 device, but it w i l l  not 
have the power of a full Type I system. 
Now a few comments to Figure i 
The "balloons" in the figure represent inde- 
pendent programs (later to be developed into inde- 
pendent  processes  inside one "big" program). The 
f igure  d i sp lays  those  programs that  so far 
( January 1983) have been imp lemented  and tested 
(to some extent). Other programs wil l  successively 
be entered into the system. 
The big ba l loon  label led "The C losed Cat" 
represents a program that recognizes closed word 
c lasses  such as prepos i t ions ,  con junct ions ,  p ro -  
nouns,  aux i l i a r ies ,  and so on. The C losed Cat 
recognizes  full word forms directly.  The SMURF 
ba l loon  represents  the morpho log ica l  component  
(SMURF = "Swedish Murphology").  SMURF i tsel f  is 
organized internally as a complex system of inde- 
pendent ly  operat ing "demons" - SMURFs  - each 
knowing "its' little corner of Swedish word forma- 
tion. (The name of the program is an a l lus ion to 
the popu lar  comic  s t r ip  leprechauns  "les 
Scht roumpfs" ,  wh ich  in Swed ish  are  ca l led  
"smurfar".) Thus there is one little smurf recog- 
n i z ing  der ivat \ [ona l  morphemes ,  one recogn iz ing  
flectional endings, and so on. One special smurf, 
Phonotax, has an important controlling function - 
every other smur f  must  a lways  consult  Phonotax  
before identifying one of "its" (potential) forma- 
tires; the word minus this formative must still be 
pronounceable, otherwise it cannot be a formative. 
SMURF works  ent i re ly  w i thout  s tem lexicon; it 
adheres  complete ly  to the "phi losophy" of us ing 
surface signals as far as possible. 
NOMFRAS, VERBAL, IFIGEN, CLAUS and PREPPS are 
other "demons" that recognize different phrases or 
word  groups w i th in  sentences,  viz. noun phrases,  
verba l  complexes,  in f in i t iva l  construct ions ,  
c lauses and prepos i t iona l  phrases, respectively. 
N-lex, V - lex  and A- lex  represent  var ious (sub)- 
lexicons; so far we have tried to do without them 
as far as possible.  One should  observe that s tem 
lex icons are no prerequ is i tes  for the sys tem to 
work, adding them only enhances its performance. 
The format of the material inside the Pool is 
the or ig ina l  text, plus appropr ia te  " label led 
brackets"  enc los ing  words,  word  groups, phrases 
and so on. In this way, the form of representation 
is cons istent  throughout,  no mat ter  how many 
d i f fe rent  types of ana lyses  have been appl ied to 
it. Thus, var ious people  can join our group and 
write their own "demons" in whatever language they 
prefer, as long as they can take sentences in text 
format,  be reasonably  to lerant  to what types of 
'~rackets" they find in there, do their analysis, 
add their own brackets (in the specified format), 
and put the result back into the Pool. 
68 
Of the var ious programs SMURF, NOMFRAS and 
IFIGEN are extensively tested (and, of course, The 
Closed Cat, wh ich  is a s imple  lexical lookup 
system), and various examples of analyses of these 
programs will be demonstrated in the next section. 
We hope to arr ive at a crucial  stat ion in this 
project  dur ing 1983, when CLAUS has been more 
thoroughly  tested. If CLAUS per forms the way we 
hope (and pre l iminary  tests indicate that it 
will), we will  have means to identify very quickly 
the c lausal  s t ructures of the sentences in an 
arb i t rary  running text, thus having a f i rm base 
for entering higher h ierarch ies  in the syntact ic  
domains. 
The programs are written in the Beta language 
developed by the present author; c.f. Brodda-  
Karlsson, 1980, and Brodda, 1983, forthcoming. Of 
the actual  programs in the system, SMURF was 
developed and extens ive ly  tested by B.B. dur ing 
1977-79 (Brodda, 1979), whereas  the others are 
(being) developed by B.B. and/or Gunnel KEllgren, 
Stockholm (mostly "and"). 
III EXPLODING SOME OF THE BALLOONS 
When a "fresh" text is entered into The Pool  
it f irst passes through a pre l iminary  one-pass-  
program, INIT, (not shown in Fig. i) that "normal- 
izes" the text. The or ig inal  text may be of any 
type as long as it Is regular ly  typed Swedish.  
INIT t ransforms the text so that each graphic  
sentence will  make up exactly one physical record. 
(Except in poetry, phys ica l  records, i.e. lines, 
usual ly  are of marg ina l  l inguist ic  interest.) 
Paragraph ends wi l l  be represented by empty  re- 
cords. Periods used to indicate abbreviations are 
Just taken away and the abbrev ia t ion  itself  is 
contracted to one graphic word, if necessary; thus 
"t.ex." ("e.g.") is t rans formed into "rex", and so 
on. Otherwise, periods, commas, question marks and 
other typographic  characters  are provided wi th  
preceding blanks. Through this each word is 
guaranteed to be surrounded by blanks, and de- 
l imi ters  llke commas,  per iods and so on are 
guaranteed to signal their "normal" textual func- 
tions. Each record is also ended by a sentence 
delimiter (preceded by a blank). Some manual post- 
ed i t ing is somet imes  needed in order to get the 
text normal i zed  accord ing to the above. In the 
IN IT-phase no l inguist ic  analysis  whatsoever  is 
in t roduced (other than into what appears to be 
orthographic sentences). 
INIT also changes all letters in the original 
text to their cor respond ing  upper case variants. 
(Or ig inal ly  capita l  letters are opt iona l ly  pro- 
vided wi th  a pref ixed "=".) All subsequent ana- 
lysis p rograms add their analyses In the form of 
lower  case letters or letter combinat ions.  Thus 
upper case letters or words wi l l  belong to the 
object language, and lower case letters or letter 
combinat ions  w i l l  s ignal  meta-language informa- 
tion. In this way, str ict ly  text (ASCII) format 
can be kept for the text as wel l  as for the va- 
rious stages of its analysis; the "philosophy" to 
use text Input and text output for all programs 
involved represents the computational solution to 
the prob lem of how to make it poss ib le  for each 
process to work independently of all other in the 
system. 
The C losed Cat (CC) has the important  role to 
mark words belonging to some well defined closed 
categor ies  of words. This p rogram makes no in- 
ternal analysis of the words, and only takes full 
words into account. CC makes use of simple rewrite 
rules of the type '~  => eP~e / (blank)__(blank)", 
where  the inserted e's represent  the "analysis" 
("e" s tands  for "prepos i t ion" ;  P~ = "on"). A 
sample  output f rom The Closed Cat is shown in 
i l lus t ra t ion  2, where  the var ious meta -symbols  
a lso  are  exp la ined .  
The s imple  example  above also shows the 
format of inserted meta-lnformatlon. Each Identi- 
f ied const i tuent  is "tagged" w i th  sur round ing  
lower case letters, which then can be conceived of 
as labe l led  brackets .  Th is  fo rmat  is used  
throughout the system, also for complex constit- 
uents. Thus the nominal phrase 'DEN LILLA FLICKAN" 
( " the  l i t t le  g i r l " )  w i l l  be tagged as 
"'nDEN+LILLA+FLICKANn" by NOMFRAS (cf. below; the 
pluses are inserted to make the const i tuent  one 
cont inuous string). We have reserved the letters 
n, v and s for the major  categor ies  nouns or noun 
phrases, verbs or verbal  groups, and sentences, 
respectively, whereas other more or less transpar- 
ent letters are used for other categories. (A list 
of used category symbols  is presented in the 
Appendix: Printout Illustrations.) 
The program SWEMRF (or sMuRF, as it is ca l led  
here) has been extens ive ly  descr ibed e lsewhere  
(Brodda, 1979). It makes a rather intr icate 
morpho log ica l  analys is  word-by-word  In running 
text (i.e. SMURF analyzes each word  in itself, 
disregarding the context it appears in). SMURF can 
be run in two modes, in "segmentat ion"  mode and 
"analysis" mode. In its segmentat ion  mode SMURF 
simply strips off the possible affixes from each 
word; it makesno  use of any stem lexicon. (The 
af f ixes it recognizes are common pref ixes,  suf-  
f ixes - i.e. der lvat lona l  morphemes - and flex- 
lonal endings.) In analysis mode it also tries to 
make an opt imal  guess of the word class of.the 
word under inspection, based on what (combinations 
of) word formation elements it finds in the word. 
SMURF in itself is organized entirely according to 
the heur is t ic  pr inc ip les  as they are conceived 
here, i.e. as a set of independent ly  operat ing 
processes that interactively work on each others 
output. The SMURF system has been the test bench 
for test ing out the methods now being used 
throughout the entire Heuristic Parsing Project. 
In its segmentat ion  mode SMURF funct ions 
formally as a set of interactive transformations, 
where the st ructura l  changes happen to be ex- 
tremely simple, viz. simple segmentation rules of 
the type 'T=>P-", "Sffi> -S" and "Effi>-E '' for an 
arbitrary Prefix, Suffix and Ending, respectively, 
but where  the "Job" essent ia l ly  cons ists  of 
es tab l i sh ing  the cor respond ing  structura l  de- 
scriptions. These are shown in III. I, below, 
together with sample analyses. It should be noted 
that phonotact lc  constra ints  play a central role 
69 
in the SMURF system; i n  fact, one of the main  
ob ject ives  in des ign ing  the SMURF system was to 
find out how much information actually was carried 
by the phonntact lc  component  in Swedish.  (It 
turned out to be quite much; cf. Brodda 1979. This 
probab ly  holds for other Germanic  languages as 
well, which all have a rather elaborated phono- 
taxis.) 
NOMFRAS is the next program to be commented 
on. The present vers ion  recognizes  s t ructures  of 
the type 
det/quant + (adJ)~ + noun; 
where the "det/quant" categories (i.e. determiners 
or quant l f lers)  are def ined exp l i c i t l y  through 
enumeration - they are supposed to belong to the 
class of "surface markers" and are as such identi- 
f ied by The C losed Cat. Ad ject ives  and nouns on 
the other hand are identified solely on the ground 
of their  "cadences", i.e. what  kind of ( formal ly)  
end lng- l l ke  str ings they happen to end with. The 
number  of ad ject ives  that are accepted (n in the 
formula above) varies depending on what (probable) 
type of construction is under inspection. In inde- 
finite noun phrases the substantial content of the 
expected endings is, to say the least, meager, as 
both nouns and adjectives in many situations only 
have O-endings. In definite noun phrases the noun 
mostly - but not always - has a more substantial 
and recogn izab le  end ing and all in terven ing  ad- 
Jectives have either the cadence -A or a cadence 
f rom a smal l  but character i s t i c  set. In a (sup- 
posed) def in i te  noun phrase all words ending in 
any of the ment ioned  cadences are assumed to be 
adject ives,  but in (supposed) indef in i te  noun 
phrases not more  than one adject ive is assumed 
unless other  types of morpho log ica l  support  are 
present. 
The F in i te  State Scheme behind NOMFRAS is 
presented in Ill. 2, together with sample outputs; 
in this case the text has been preprocessed by The 
Closed Cat, and it appears that these two programs 
in cooperation are able to recognize noun phrases 
of the discussed type correctly to well over 95% 
in running text (at a speed of about 5 sentences  
per second, CPU-t lme);  the errors were  shared 
about 50% each between over- and undergenerations. 
Preliminary experiments aiming at including also 
SMURF and FREPPS (Preposit ional Phrases) seem to 
indicate that about the same recall and precision 
rate could be kept for arb i t rary  types of (non- 
sentent la l )  noun phrases (cf. Iii. 6). (The sys- 
tems are not yet t r immed to the extent that they 
can be operatively run together.) 
IF IGEN ( Inf init ive Generator)  is another  
ra ther  s t ra ight fo rward  F in i te  State Pat tern  
Matcher (developed by Gunnel K~llgren). It recog- 
n i zes  (groups  of) nnnf ln l te  verbs. Somewhat  
simplif ied it can be represented by the following 
d iagram ( remember  the convent ions for upper and 
lower case):

where '~ux" and "Adv" are categories recognized by 
The Closed Cat (tagged "g" and "a", respectively), 
and "nXn" are s t ructures  recognized by e i ther  
NOMFRAS or, in the case of persona l  pronouns,  by 
CC (It should he worth mentioning that the class 
of aux i l i a r ies  in Swed ish  is more  open than the 
corresponding word class in English; besides the 
"ordinary" VARA ("to be"), HA ("to have") and the 
modalsy, there is a fuzzy class of seml-auxil larles 
llke BORJA ("begin") and others; IFIGEN makes use 
of about 20 of these in the present  version.) The 
supine cadence -(A/I)'T is supposed to appear only 
once in an in f in i t iva l  group. A sample  output of 
IFIGEN is given in Iii. 3. Also for IFIGEN we have 
reached a recogn i t ion  level  around 95%, which, 
again, is rather  astonish ing,  cons ider ing  how 
little information actually is made use of in the 
system. 
The IFIGEN case illustrates very clearly one 
of the centra l  points in our heur i s t i c  approach,  
namely the following: The information that a word 
has a specific cadence, in this case the cadence 
-A, is usua l ly  of very l l t t le s ign i f i cance  in 
itself in Swedish. Certainly it is a typical infi- 
n l t lva l  cadence (at least 90% of all in f in i t ives  
in Swed ish  have it), but on the other hand, it is 
cer ta in ly  a very typica l  cadence for other types 
of words as well: FLICKA (noun), HELA (adjective), 
DENNA/DETTA/DESSA (determiners or pronouns) and so 
on, and these other types are by no comparison the 
dominant  group having this spec i f ic  cadence in 
running text. But, in connection with an "infini- 
tive warner" - an auxiliary, or the word ATT - the 
situation changes dramatically. This can be demon- 
strated by the following figures: In running text 
words having the cadance -A represents infinitives 
in about  30% of the cases. ATT is an in f in i t ive  
marker  (equivalent  to "to") in qui te exact ly  50% 
of its occurences  (the other  50% it is a subord i -  
nat ing conjunction).  The condit ional probability 
that the conf igurat ion  ATT ..-A represents  an 
in f ln l tve is, however ,  greater  than 99%, pro-  
v ided that character i s t i c  cadences l ike -ARNA/ -  
ORNA and quant i f le rs /determiners  llke ALLA and 
DESSA are d i s regarded  (In our system they are 
marked by SMURF and The Closed Cat, respectively, 
and thereby "saved" from being classified as infi- 
nitives.) G iven this, there is a lmost  no over-  
generation in IFIGEN, but Swedish allows for split 
in f in i t ives  to some extent. Quite much mater ia l  
can be put in between the in f in i t ive  warner  and 
the infinitive, and this gives rise to some under- 
generation (presengly). (Similar observat ions  re- 
gard ing cond i t iona l  probabi l i t ies  in conf igura-  
t ions of l inguist ic  units has been made by Mats  
Eeg-Olofson, Lund, 1982).

APPENDIX:  Some computer  i l l us t ra t ions  
The following three pages illustrate some of the parsing diagrams used in 
the system: Iii. I, SMURF, and Iii. 2, NOMFRAS, together with sample analyses. 
IFIGEN is represented by sample analyses (III. 3; the diagram is given in the 
text)? The samples are all taken from running text analysis (from a novel by 
Ivar Lo-Johansson), and "pruned" only in the way that trivial, recurrent examples 
are omitted. Some typical erroneous analyses are also shown (prefixed by **). 
In III. I SMURF is run in segmentation mode only, and the existing tags are 
inserted by the Closed Cat. "A and "E in word final position indicates the 
corresponding cadences (fullfilling the pattern ?..V~M'A/E '', where M denotes a 
set of admissible medial clusters)? 
The tags inserted by CC are: aft(sentence) adverbials, b=particles, dfdeterminers, 
efprepositions, g=auxiliaries, h=(forms of) HA(VA), iffiinfinitives, j=adjectives, 
n=nouns, Kfconjunctions, q=quantifiers, r=pronouns, ufsupine verb form, v=verbal 
(group)? 
(For space reasons, III. 3 is given first, then I and II.)
