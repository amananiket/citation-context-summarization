Abstract  
In this paper, we propose a new idea for 
the automatic recognition of domain 
specific terms. Our idea is based on the 
statistics between a compound noun and 
its component single-nouns. More 
precisely, we focus basically on how 
many nouns adjoin the noun in question 
to form compound nouns. We propose 
several scoring methods based on this 
idea and experimentally evaluate them on 
the NTCIR1 TMREC test collection. The 
results are very promising especially in 
the low recall area. 
Introduction 
Automatic term recognition, ATR in short, 
aims at extracting domain specific terms 
from a corpus of a certain academic or 
technical domain. The majority of domain 
specific terms are compound nouns, in 
other words, uninterrupted collocations.  
85% of domain specific terms are said to 
be compound nouns. They include 
single-nouns of the remaining 15% very 
frequently as their components, where 
?single-noun? means a noun which could 
not be further divided into several 
shorter and more basic nouns. In other 
words, the majority of compound nouns 
consist of the much smaller number of 
the remaining 15% single-noun terms 
and other single-nouns. In this situation, 
it is natural to pay attention to the 
relation among single-nouns and 
compound nouns, especially how 
single-noun terms contribute to make up 
compound noun terms.  
Another important feature of domain 
specific terms is termhood proposed in 
(Kageura & Umino 96) where ?termhood? 
refers to the degree that a linguistic unit 
is related to a domain-specific concept.  
Thus, what we really have to pursue is an 
ATR method which directly uses the 
notion of termhood.  
Considering these factors, the way of 
making up compound nouns must be 
heavily related to the termhood of the 
compound nouns. The first reason is that 
termhood is usually calculated based on 
term frequency and bias of term 
frequency like inverse document 
frequency. Even though these 
calculations give a good approximation of 
termhood, still they are not directly 
related to termhood because these 
calculations are based on superficial 
statistics. That means that they are not 
necessarily meanings in a writer's mind 
but meanings in actual use. Apparently, 
termhood is intended to reflect this type 
of meaning. The second reason is that if a 
certain single-noun, say N, expresses the 
key concept of a domain that the 
document treats, the writer of the 
document must be using N not only 
frequently but also in various ways. For 
instance, he/she composes quite a few 
compound nouns using N and uses these 
compound nouns in documents he/she 
writes. Thus, we focus on the relation 
among single-nouns and compound nouns 
in pursuing new ATR methods. 
The first attempt to make use of this 
relation has been done by (Nakagawa & 
Mori 98) through the number of distinct 
single-nouns that come to the left or right 
of a single-noun term when used in 
compound noun terms. Using this type of 
number associated with a single-noun 
term, Nakagawa and Mori proposed a 
scoring function for term candidates. 
Their term extraction method however is 
just one example of employing the 
relation among single-nouns and 
compound nouns.  Note that this 
relation is essentially based on a noun 
bigram. In this paper, we expand the 
relation based on noun bigrams that 
might be the components of longer 
compound nouns. Then we 
experimentally evaluate the power of 
several variations of scoring functions 
based on the noun bigram relation using 
the NTCIR1 TMREC test collection. By 
this experimental clarification, we could 
conclude that the single-noun term?s 
power of generating compound noun 
terms is useful and essential in ATR. 
In this paper, section 1 gives the 
background of ATR methods. Section 2 
describes the proposed method of the 
noun bigram based scoring function for 
term extraction. Section 3 describes the 
experimental results and discusses them.  
1 Background 
1.1 Candidates Extraction 
The first thing to do in ATR is to extract 
term candidates from the given text 
corpus. Here we only focus on nouns, 
more precisely a single-noun and a 
compound noun, which are exactly the 
targets of the NTCIR1 TMREC 
task(Kageura et al1999). To extract 
compound nouns which are promising 
term candidates and at the same time to 
exclude undesirable strings such as ?is a? 
or ?of the?, the frequently used method is 
to filter out the words that are members 
of a stop-word-list. More complex 
structures like noun phrases, collocations 
and so on, become focused on (Frantzi 
and Ananiadou 1996). All of these are 
good term candidates in a corpus of a 
specific domain because all of them have 
a strong unithood (Kageura&Umino96) 
which refers to the degree of strength or 
stability of syntagmatic combinations or 
collocations. We assume the following 
about compound nouns or collocations: 
 
Assumption   Terms having complex 
structure a e t  be made of xisting 
simple terms 
r o e
 
The structure of complex terms is 
another important factor for automatic 
term candidates extraction. It is 
expressed syntactically or semantically. 
As a syntactic structure, dependency 
structures that are the results of parsing 
are focused on in many works.  Since we 
focus on these complex structures, the 
first task in extracting term candidates is 
a morphological analysis including part 
of speech (POS) tagging. For Japanese, 
which is an agglutinative language, a 
morphological analysis was carried out 
which segmented words from a sentence 
and did POS tagging (Matsumoto et al 
1996). 
After POS tagging, the complex 
structures mentioned above are extracted 
as term candidates. Previous studies 
have proposed many promising ways for 
this purpose, Hisamitsu(2000) and 
Nakagawa (1998) concentrated their 
efforts on compound nouns. Frantzi and 
Ananiadou (1996) tried to treat more 
general structures like collocations. 
1.2 Scoring 
The next thing to do is to assign a score to 
each term candidate in order to rank 
them in descending order of termhood. 
Many researchers have sought the 
definition of the term candidate?s score 
which approximates termhood. In fact, 
many of those proposals make use of 
surface statistics like tf?idf. Ananiadou et 
al. proposed C-value (Frantzi and 
Ananiadou 1996) and NC-value (Frantzi 
and Ananiadou 1999) which count how 
independently the given compound noun 
is used in the given corpus. Hisamitsu 
(2000) propose a way to measure 
termhood that counts how far the given 
term is different from the distribution of 
non-domain-specific terms. All of them 
tried to capture how important and 
independent a writer regards and uses 
individual terms in a corpus 
2 Single-Noun Bigrams as Components of 
Compound Nouns 
2.1 Single-Noun Bigrams 
The relation between a single-noun and 
complex nouns that include this 
single-noun is very important. 
Nevertheless, to our knowledge, this 
relation has not been paid enough 
attention so far. Nakagawa and Mori 
(1998) proposed a term scoring method 
that utilizes this type of relation. In this 
paper, we extend our idea 
comprehensively. Here we focus on 
compound nouns among the various types 
of complex terms. In technical documents, 
the majority of domain-specific terms are 
noun phrases or compound nouns 
consisting of a small number of single 
nouns. Considering this observation, we 
propose a new scoring method that 
measures the importance of each 
single-noun. In a nutshell, this scoring 
method for a single-noun measures how 
many distinct compound nouns contain a 
particular single-noun as their part in a 
given document or corpus. Here, think 
about the situtation where single-noun N 
occurs with other single-nouns which 
might be a part of many compound nouns 
shown in Figure 1 where [N M] means 
bigram of noun N and M. 
 
[LN1  N] (#L1)         [N  RN1](#R1) 
:                              : 
[LNn  N](LN)         [N  RNm](#Rm) 
Figure 1. Noun Bigram and their Frequency 
In Figure 1, [LNi  N] (i=1,..,n) and [N  
RNj] (j=1,...,m) are single-noun bigrams 
which constitute (parts of) compound 
nouns. #Li and #Rj (i=1,..,n and j=1,..,m) 
mean the frequency of the bigram [LNi 
N] and [N RNj] respectively. Note that 
since we depict only bigrams, compound 
nouns like [LNi N RNj]  which contains 
[LNi  N] and/or [N RNj] as their parts 
might actually occur in a corpus. Again 
this noun trigram might be a part of 
longer compound nouns.  
Let us show an example of a noun bigram. 
Suppose that we extract compound nouns 
including ?trigram? as candidate terms 
from a corpus shown in the following 
example. 
Example 1. 
trigram statistics, word trigram, class 
trigram, word trigram, trigram 
acquisition, word trigram statistics, 
character trigram 
 
Then, noun bigrams consisting of a 
single-noun ?trigram? are shown in the 
following where the number bewteen 
( and ) shows the frequency. 
 
word  trigram (3)  trigram statistics (2) 
class trigram (1)  trigram acquisition (1) 
character trigram(1)                               
Figure 2. An example of noun bigram 
 
We just focus on and utilize single-noun 
bigrams to define the function on which 
scoring is based. Note that we are 
concerned only with single-noun bigrams 
and not with a single-noun per se. The 
reason is that we try to sharply focus on 
the fact that the majority of domain 
specific terms are compound nouns. 
Compound nouns are well analyzed as 
noun bigram. 
2.2 Scoring Function 
2.2.1 The direct score of a noun bigram 
Since a scoring function based on [LNi N] 
or [N RNj] could have an infinite number 
of variations, we here consider the 
following simple but representative 
scoring functions.  
 
#LDN(N) and #RDN(N) : These are the 
number of distinct single-nouns which 
directly precede or succeed N. These are 
exactly ?n? and ?m? in Figure 1. For 
instance, in an example shown in Figure 
2, #LDN(trigram)=3, #RDN(trigram)=2 
 
LN(N,k) and RN(N,k): The general 
functions that take into account the 
number of occurrences of  each noun 
bigram like [LNi N] and [N RNj] are 
defined as follows. 
For instance, if we use LN(N,1) and 
RN(N,1) in example 1, GM(trigram,1) = 
)15()13( +?+  = 4.90. In (3), GM does 
not depend on the length of a compound 
noun that is the number of single-nouns 
within the compound noun. This is 
because we have not yet had any idea 
about the relation between the 
importance of a compound noun and a 
length of the compound noun. It is fair to 
treat all compound nouns, including 
single-nouns, equally no matter how long 
or short each compound noun is.

?
=
=
RDN(N)#
1j
k    Rj)(#k)RN(N,           (2) 
We can find various functions by varying 
parameter k of (1) and (2). For instance, 
#LDN(N) and #RDN(N)  can be defined 
as  LN(N,0) and RN(N,0). LN(N,1) and 
RN(N,1) are the frequencies of nouns that 
directly precede or succeed N.  In the 
example shown in Figure 2, for example, 
LN(trigram,1)=5, and RN(trigram,1)=3. 
Now we think about the nature of (1) and 
(2) with various value of the parameter k. 
The larger k is, the more we take into 
account the frequencies of each noun 
bigram. One extreme is the case k=0, 
namely LN(N,0) and RN(N,0), where we 
do not take into account the frequency of 
each noun bigram at all. LN(N,0) and 
RN(N,0) describe how linguistically and 
domain dependently productive the noun 
N is in a given corpus. That means that 
noun N presents a key and/or basic 
concept of the domain treated by the 
corpus. Other extreme cases are large k, 
like k=2 , 4, etc. In these cases, we rather 
focus on frequency of each noun bigram. 
In other words, statistically biased use of 
noun N is the main concern. In the 
example shown in Figure 2, for example, 
LN(trigram,2)=11, and RN(trigram,2)=5. 
If k<0, we discount the frequency of each 
noun bigram. However, this case does not 
show good results of in our ATR 
experiment. 
2.2.3 Combining Compound Noun Frequency 
Information we did not use in the bigram 
based methods described in 2.2.1 and 
2.2.2 is the frequency of single-nouns and 
compound-nouns that occur 
independently, namely left and right 
adjacent words not being nouns. For 
instance,  ?word patterns? occurs 
independently in ?? use the word 
patterns occurring in ? .? Since the 
scoring functions proposed in 2.2.1 are 
noun bigram statistics,  the number of 
this kind of independent occurrences of 
nouns themselves are not used. If we take 
this information into account, a new type 
of information is used and  better results 
are expected.  
In this paper, we employ a very simple 
method for this. We observe that if a 
single-noun or a compound noun occurs 
independently, the score of the noun is 
multiplied by the number of its 
independent occurrences. Then 
GM(CN,k) of the formula (3) is  revised. 
We call this new GM FGM(CN,k)  and 
define it as follows. 
2.2.2 Score of compound nouns 
The next thing to do is to extend the 
scoring functions of a single-noun to the 
scoring functions of a compound noun. We 
adopt a very simple method, namely a 
geometric mean. Now  think about a 
compound noun : CN = N1 N2?N L. Then  
a geometric mean: GM of CN is defined as 
follows. 
 
if N occurs independently  
then f(CN)k)GM(CN,k)FGM(CN, ?=  
where f(CN) means the number of 
independent occurrences of noun CN 
)3(1)k),1)(RN(Nk),(LN(N
k)GM(CN,

L
1i
ii ????
?
???
? ++= ?
=
        
(33 +
                     
For instance, in example 1, if we find 
independent ?trigram? three times in the corpus, 
FGM(trigram,1)= 1)(51) +?? =14.70 
---  (4)                
2.2.4 Modified C-value 
We compare our methods with the 
C-value based method(Frantzi and 
Ananiadou 1996) because  1) their 
method is very powerful to extract and 
properly score compound nouns., and 2) 
their method is basically based on 
unithood. On the contrary, our scoring 
functions proposed in 2.2.1 try to capture 
termhood. However the original 
definition of C-value can not score a 
single-noun because the important part 
of the definition C-value is: 
)
c(a)
t(a)-1)(n(a)-length(a)(value(a)-C =   
--- (5) 
where a is compound noun, length(a) is 
the number of single-nouns which make 
up a, n(a) is  the total frequency of 
occurrence of a on the corpus, t(a) is the 
frequency of occurrence of a in longer 
candidate terms, and c(a) is the number 
of those candidate terms. 
As known from (5), all single-noun?s 
C-value come to be 0. The reason why the 
first term of right hand side is 
(length(a)-1) is that C-value originally 
seemed to capture how much 
computational effort is to be made in 
order to recognize the important part of 
the term. Thus, if the length(a)  is 1, we 
do not need any effort to recognize its 
part because the term a is a  single-word 
and does not have its part. But we intend 
to capture how important the term is for 
the writer or reader, namely its termhood. 
In order to make the C-value capture 
termhood, we modify (5) as follows. 
)
c(a)
t(a)-n(a)length(a)(value(a)-MC =  (6) 
Where ?MC-value? means ?Modified 
C-value.? 
3 Experimental Evaluation  
3.1 Experiment 
In our experiment, we use the NTCIR1 
TMREC test collection (Kageura et al
1999). As an activity of TMREC, they 
have provided us with a Japanese test 
collection of a term recognition task. The 
goal of this task is to automatically 
recognize and extract terms from a text 
corpus which contains  1,870 abstracts 
gathered from the computer science and 
communication engineering domain 
corpora of the NACSIS Academic 
Conference Database, and 8,834 
manually collected correct terms. The 
TMREC text corpus is morphologically 
analyzed and POS tagged by hand. From 
this POS tagged text, we extract 
uninterrupted noun sequences as term 
candidates. Actually 16,708 term 
candidates are extracted and several 
scoring methods are applied to them. All 
the extracted term candidates CNs are 
ranked according to their  GM(CN,k), 
FGM(CN,k) and MC-value(CN) in 
descending order. As for parameter k of 
(1) and (2), we choose k=1 because its 
performance is the best among various 
values of k in the range from 0 to 4. Thus, 
henceforth, we omit k from GM and FGM, 
like GM(CN) and FGM(CN). We use 
GM(CN) as the baseline. 
In evaluation, we conduct experiments 
where we pick up the highest ranked 
term candidate down to the PNth highest 
ranked term candidate by these three 
scoring methods, and evaluate the set of 
selected terms with the number of correct 
terms, we call it CT, within it. In the 
following figures, we only show CT 
because recall is CT/8834, where 8834 is 
the number of all correct terms, precision 
is CT/PN.  
Another measure NTCIR1 provides us 
with is the terms which include the 
correct term as its part. We call it ?longer 
term? or LT. They are sometimes valued 
terms and also indicate in what context 
the correct terms are used. Then we also 
use the number of longer terms in our 
evaluation.

In Figure 3, the Y-axis represents CT in 
other words the number of correct terms 
picked up by GM(CN) and the number of 
longer terms picked up by GM(CN) for 
each PN. They are our baseline. The 
Figure 4 shows the difference between CT 
of FGM(CN) and CT of GM(CN) and the 
difference between CT of MC-value(CN) 
and CT of GM(CN)  for each PN. Figure 
5 shows the difference between LT of 
GM(CN) and LT of FGM(CN) or LT of 
MC-value(CN) for each PN. As known 
from Figure 4, FGM based method 
outperforms MC-value up to 1,400 
highest ranked terms. Since in the 
domains of TMREC task that are 
computer science and communication 
engineering, 1,400 technical terms are 
important core terms, FGM method we 
propose is very promising to extract and 
recognize domain specific terms. We also 
show CT of each method for larger PN, 
say, from 3000 up to 15000 in Table 1 and 
2.

12000 10523 10488 9852 
15000 12174 12186 12070 
 
As seen in these figures and tables, if we 
want more terms about these domains, 
MC-value is more powerful, but when PN 
is larger than 12,000, again FGM 
outperforms. As for recognizing longer 
terms, GM(CN), which is the baseline, 
performs best for every PN. MC-value is 
the worst. From this observation we come 
to know that MC-value tends to assign 
higher score to shorter terms than GM or 
FGM. We are also interested in what kind 
of term is favored by each method. For 
this, we show the average length of the 
highest PN ranked terms of each method 
in Figure 6 where length of CN means 
the number of single-words CN consists 
of. Clearly, GM prefers longer terms. So 
does FGM. On the contrary, MC-value 
prefers shorter terms. However, as shown 
in Figure 6, the average length of the 
MC-value is more fluctuating. That 
means GM and FGM have more 
consistent tendency in ranking compound 
nouns. Finally we compare our results 
with NTCIR1 results (Kageura et al
1999). Unfortunately since (Kageura et al
1999) only provides the number of the all 
extracted terms and also the number of 
the all extracted correct terms, we could 
not directly compare our results with 
other NTCIR1 participants. Then, what 
is important is the fact that we extracted 
7,082 correct terms from top 15,000 term 
candidates with the FGM methods. This 
fact is indicating that our methods show 
the highest performance among all other 
participants of NTCIR1 TMREC task 
because 1) the highest number of terms 
within the top 16,000 term candidates is 
6,536 among all the participants of 
NTCIR1 TMREC task, and 2) the highest 
number or terms in all the participants of 
NTCIR1 TMREC task is 7,944, but they 
are extracted from top 23,270 term 
candidates, which means extremely low 
precision.
