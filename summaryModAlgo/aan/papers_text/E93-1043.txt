Abstract 
In this paper a morphological component 
with a limited capability to automatically 
interpret (and generate) derived words is 
presented. The system combines an ex- 
tended two-level morphology \[Trost, 1991a; 
Trost, 1991b\] with a feature-based word 
grammar building on a hierarchical lexicon. 
Polymorphemic stems not explicitly stored 
in the lexicon are given a compositional in- 
terpretation. That way the system allows 
to minimize redundancy in the lexicon be- 
cause derived words that are transparent 
need not to be stored explicitly. Also, words 
formed ad-hoc can be recognized correctly. 
The system is implemented in CommonLisp 
and has been tested on examples from Ger- 
man derivation. 
1 Introduction 
This paper is about words. Since word is a rather 
fuzzy term we will first try to make clear what word 
means in the context of this paper. Following \[di Sci- 
ullo and Williams, 1989\] we discriminate two senses. 
One is the morphological word which is built from 
morphs according to the rules of morphology. The 
other is the syntactic word which is the atomic entity 
from which sentences are built according to the rules 
of syntax. 
*Work on this project was partially sponsored by 
the Austrian Federal Ministry for Science and Research 
and the "Fonds zur FSrderung der wissenschaftlichen 
Forschung" grant no.P7986-PHY. I would also like to 
thank John Nerbonne, Klaus Netter and Wolfgang Heinz 
for comments on earlier versions of this paper. 
These two views support wo different sets of infor- 
mation which are to be kept separate but which are 
not disjunctive. The syntactical word carries infor- 
mation about category, valency and semantics, infor- 
mation that is important for the interpretation of a 
word in the context of the sentence. It also carries in- 
formation like case, number, gender and person. The 
former information is basically the same for all dif- 
ferent surface forms of the syntactic word 1 the latter 
is conveyed by the different surface forms produced 
by the inflectional paradigm and is therefore shared 
with the morphological word. 
Besides this shared information the morphologi- 
cal word carries information about the inflectional 
paradigm, the stem, and the way it is internally 
structured. In our view the lexicon should be a me- 
diator between these two views of word. 
Traditionally, the lexicon in natural anguage pro- 
cessing (NLP) systems is viewed as a finite collection 
of syntactic words. Words have stored with them 
their syntactic and semantic information. In the 
most simple case the lexicon contains an entry for 
every different word form. For highly inflecting (or 
agglutinating) languages this approach is not feasible 
for realistic vocabulary sizes. Instead, morphological 
components are used to map between the different 
surface forms of a word and its canonical form stored 
in the lexicon. We will call this canonical form and 
the information associated with it lezeme. 
There are problems with such a static view of the 
lexicon. In the open word classes our vocabulary is 
potentially infinite. Making use of derivation and 
compounding speakers (or writers) can and do al- 
ways create new words. A majority of these words

derived regularly, e.g., by lexical rules.

are invented on the spot and may never be used 
again. Skimming through real texts one will always 
find such ad-hoc formed words not to be found in 
any lexicon that are nevertheless readily understood 
by any competent reader. A realistic NLP system 
should therefore have means to cope with ad-hoc 
word formation. 
Efficiency considerations also support the idea of 
extending morphological components o treat deriva- 
tion. Because of the regularities found in derivation 
a lexicon purely based on words will be highly re- 
dundant and wasting space. On the other hand a 
large percentage of lexicalized derived words (and 
compounds) is no longer transparent syntactically 
and/or semantically and has to be treated like a 
monomorphemic lexeme. What we do need then is 
a system that is flexible enough to allow for both a 
compositional nd an idiosyncratic reading of poly- 
morphemic stems. 
The system described in this paper is a combi- 
nation of a feature-based hierarchical lexicon and 
word grammar with an extended two-level morphol- 
ogy. Before desribing the system in more detail we 
will shortly discuss these two strands of research. 
2 Inheritance Lexica 
Research directed at reducing redundancy in the lexi- 
con has come up with the idea of organizing the infor- 
mation hierarchically making use of inheritance (see, 
e.g. \[Daelemans et al, 1992; Russell et al, 1992\]). 
Various formalisms upporting inheritance have 
been proposed that can be classified into two major 
approaches. One uses defaults, i.e., inherited data 
may be overwritten by more specific ones. The de- 
fault mechanism handles exceptions which are an in- 
herent phenomenon of the lexicon. A well-known 
formalism following this approach is DATR \[Evans 
and Gazdar, 1989\]. 
The major advantage of defaults is the rather nat- 
ural hierarchy formation it supports where classes 
can be organized in a tree instead of a multiple- 
inheritance hierarchy. Drawbacks are that defaults 
are computationally costly and one needs an inter- 
face to the sentence grammar which is usually writ- 
ten in default-free feature descriptions. 
Although the term default is taken from knowledge 
representation e should be aware of the quite dif- 
ferent usage. In knowledge representation defaults 
are used to describe uncertain facts which may or 
may not become xplicitly known later on. 2 Excep- 
tions in the lexicon are of a different nature because 
they form an a priori known set. For any word it is 
2An example for the use of defaults in knowledge rep- 
resentation is an inference rule like Birds typically can fly. 
In the absence of more detailed knowledge this allows me 
to conclude that Tweety which I only know to be a bird 
can fly. Should I later on get the additional information 
that Tweety is a penguin I must revoke that conclusion. 
known whether it is regular or an exception. 3 The 
only motivation to use defaults in the lexicon is that 
they allow for a more concise and natural represen- 
tation. 
The alternative approach organizes classes in 
a multiple-inheritance hierarchy without defaults. 
This means that lexical items can be described as 
standard feature terms organized in a type hierarchy 
(see, e.g., \[Smolka, 1988; Carpenter el al., 1991\]). 
The advantages are clear. There is no need for an 
interface to the grammar and computational com- 
plexity is lower. 
At the moment it is an open question which of the 
two anppproaches i  the more appropriate. In our 
system we decided against introducing a new for- 
malism. Most current natural anguage systems are 
based on feature formalisms and we see no obvious 
reason why the lexicon should not be feature-based 
(see also \[Nerbonne, 1992\]). 
While inheritance lexica--concerned with the syn- 
tactic word--have mainly been used to express gen- 
eralizations over classes of words the idea can also 
be used for the explicit representation of deriva- 
tion. In \[Nerbonne, 1992\] we find such a proposal. 
What the proposal shares with most of the other 
schemes is that not much consideration is given to 
morphophonology. The problem is acknowledged by 
some authors by using a function morphologically ap- 
pend instead of pure concatenation of morphs but it 
remains unclear how this function should be imple- 
mented. 
The approach presented here follows this line of re- 
search in complementing anextended two-level mor- 
phology with a hierarchical lexicon that contains as 
entries not only words but also morphs. This way 
morphophonology can be treated in a principled way 
while retaining the advantages of hierarchical lexica. 
3 Two-Level Morphology 
For dealing with a compositional syntax and seman- 
tics of derivatives one needs a component that is 
capable of constructing arbitrary words from a fi- 
nite set of morphs according to morphotactic rules. 
Very successful in the domain of morphological nal- 
ysis/generation are finite-state approaches, notably 
two-level morphology \[Koskenniemi, 1984\]. Two- 
level morphology deals with two aspects of word for- 
mation: 
Morphotact i cs :  The combination rules that gov- 
ern which morphs may be combined in what or- 
der to produce morphologically correct words. 
Morphophono logy :  Phonological alterations oc- 
curing in the process of combination. 
Morphotactics i dealt with by a so-called continua- 
tion lexicon. In expressiveness that is equivalent to 
a finite state automaton consuming morphs. 
aWe do not consider language acquisition here. 
369 
Morphophonology is treated by assuming two dis- 
tinct levels, namely a lexical and a surface level. The 
lexical evel consists of a sequence of morphs as found 
in the lexicon; the surface level is the form found 
in the actual text/utterance. The mapping between 
these two levels is constrained by so-called two-level 
rules describing the contexts for certain phonological 
alterations. 
An example for a morphophonolocical alteration 
in German is the insertion of e between a stem end- 
ing in a t or d, and a suffix starting with s or t, e.g., 
3rd person singular of the verb arbeiten (to work) is 
arbeitest. In two-level morphology that means that 
the lexical form arbei~+st has to be mapped to sur- 
face arbeitest. The following rule will enforce just 
that mapping: 
(1) +:e gO {d, t} _ {s, t}; 
A detailed escription of two-level morphology can 
be found in \[Sproat, 1992, chapter 3\]. 
In its basic form two-level morphology is not well 
suited for our task because all the morphosyntactic 
information is encoded in the lexical form. When 
connected to a syntactic/semantic component one 
needs an interface to mediate between the morpho- 
logical and the syntactic word. We will show in in 
chapter 5 how our version of two-level-morphology is 
extended to provide such an interface. 
4 Der ivat ion  in  German 
Usually, in German derived words are morphologi- 
cally regular. 4 Morphophonological lterations are 
the same as for inflection only the occurrence of um- 
laut is less regular. Syntax and semantics on the 
other hand are very often irregular with respect to 
compositional rules for derivation. 
As an example we will look at the German deriva- 
tional prefix be-. This prefix is both very productive 
and considered to be rather regular. The prefix be- 
produces transitive verbs mostly from (intransitive) 
verbs but also from other word categories. We will 
restrict ourselves here to all those cases where the 
new verb is formed from a verb. In the new verb 
the direct object role is filled by a modifier role of 
the original verb while the original meaning is ba- 
sically preserved. One regularly formed example is 
bearbeiten derived from the intransitive verb arbeiten 
(to work). 
(2) \[Maria\]svBj arbeitet \[an dem Papier\]eoBj. 
Mary works on the paper. 
(3) \[Maria\]svBJ bearbeitet \[das Papier\]oBj. 
Skimming through \[Wahrig, 1978\] we find 238 en- 
4Most exceptions are regularly inflecting compound 
verbs derived from an irregular verb, e.g., handhaben (to 
manipulate) a regular verb derived from the irregular 
verb haben (to have). 
tries starting with prefix be-. 91 of these can be 
excluded because they cannot be explained as be- 
ing derived from verbs. Of the remaining 147 words 
about 60 have no meaning that can be interpreted 
compositionally. 5 The remaining ones do have at 
least one compositional meaning. 
Even with those the situation is difficult. In some 
cases the derived word takes just one of the meanings 
of the original word as its semantic basis, e.g., befol- 
gen (to obey) is derived from folgen in the meaning 
to obey, but not to follow or to ensue: 
(4) Der Soldat folgt \[dem Befehl \]~onJ. 
The soldier obeys the order. 
(5) Der Soldat befolgt \[den Befehl \]oBJ. 
(6) Bet Soldat folgt \[dem 017izier \]IonJ. 
The soldier follows the officer. 
(7) *Der Soldat befolgt \[den Offizier \]oBJ. 
In other cases we have a compositional as well as 
a non-compositional reading, e.g., besetzen derived 
from setzen (to set) may either mean to set or to 
occupy. 
What is needed is a flexible system where regu- 
larities can be expressed to reduce redundancy while 
irregularities can still easily be handled. 
5 The  Morpho log ica l  Component  
X2MORF 
X2MORF \[Trost, 1991a; Trost, 1991b\] that forms the 
basis of our system is a morphological component 
based on two-level morphology. X2MORF extends 
the standard model in two way which are crucial for 
our task. A feature-based word grammer replaces the 
continuation class approach thus providing a natural 
interface to the syntax/semantics component. Two- 
level rules are provided with a morphological filter 
restricting their application to certain morphological 
classes. 
5.1 Feature -Based  Grammar  and  Lex icon  
In X2MORF morphotactics are described by a 
feature-based grammar. As a result, the represen- 
tation of a word form is a feature description. The 
word grammar employs a functor argument structure 
with binary branching. 
Let us look at a specific example. The (simplified) 
entry for the noun stem Hand (hand) is given in fig.1. 
To form a legal word that stem must combine with 
an inflectional ending. Fig.2 shows the (simplified) 
entry for the plural ending. Note that plural for- 
mation also involves umlaut, i.e., the correct surface 
5About half of them are actually derived from words 
from other classes like belehlen (to order) which is clearly 
derived from the noun Belehl (order) and not the verb 
fehlen (to miss).

5.2 Extending Two-level Rules with 
Morphological Contexts 
X2MORF employs an extended version of two-level 
rules. Besides the standard phonological context 
they also have a morphological context in form of 
a feature structure. This morphological context is 
unified with the feature structure of the morph to 
which the character pair belongs. This morphologi- 
cal context serves two purposes. One is to restrict the 
application of morphophonological rules to suitable 
morphological contexts. The other is to enable the 
transmission of information from the phonological to 
the morphological level. 
We can now show how umlaut is treated in 
X2MORF.  A two-level rule constrains the mapping 
of A to ~ to the appropriate contexts, namely where 
the inflection suff?x requires umlaut: 
(8) A:~ ?~_ ; \[MORPH: \[HEAD: \[UMLAUT: +\] \]\] 
The occurrence of the umlaut ~ in the surface form 
is now coupled to the feature UMLAUT taking the 
value +. As we can see in fig.3 the plural ending has 
forced the feature to take that value already which 
means that the morphological context of the rule is 
valid. 
Reinhard \[Reinhard, 1991\] argues that a purely 
feature-based approach is not well suited for the 
treatment of umlaut in derivation because of its id- 
iosyncrasy. One example are different derivations 
from Hand (hand) which takes umlaut for plural 
(ll~nde) and some derivations (h~ndisch) but not for 
others (handlich) There are also words like Tag (day) 
where the plural takes no umlaut (Tage) but deriva- 
tions do (tSglich). Reinhard maintains that a default 
mechanism like DATR is more appropriate to deal 
with umlaut. 
We disagree since the facts can be described in 
X2MORF in a fairly natural manner. Once the 
equivalence classes with respect o umlaut are known 
we can describe the data using a complex feature 
UMLAUT 6 instead of the simple binary one. This 
complex feature UMLAUT consists of a feature for 
each class, which takes as value + or - and one fea- 
ture value for the recording of actual occurrence of 
umlaut: 
LrMLAUT: 
"VALUE: binary\] 
PL-UML: binary\] 
LICH-UML: binary I 
ISCH-UML: binaryJ 
The value of the feature UMLAUT\[VALUE is set by 
the morphological fi ter of the two-level rule trigger- 
ing umlaut, i.e., if an umlaut is found it is set to + 
otherwise to -. The entries of those affixes requiring 
umlaut set the value of their equivalence class to +. 
Therefore the relevant parts of the entries for -iich 
and -isch look like \[UMLAUT: \[UOH-U~,: +\] \ ]  and 
\[UMLAUT: \[ISCH-UML: + \]\] because both these end- 
ings normally require umlaut. 
As we have seen above the noun Hand comes with 
umlaut in the plural (llSnde) and the derived adjec- 
tive hSndisch (manually)but (irregularly) without 
umlaut in the adjective handlich (handy). In fig.4 
we show the relevant part of the entry for Hand that 
produces the correct results. The regular cases are 
6In our simplified example we assume just 3 classes 
(for plural, derivation with -lich and -isch). In reality the 
number of classes is larger but still fairly small.

The first disjunct in this feature structure takes 
care of all cases but the derivation with .lich. The 
entries for plural (see fig.5) and -isch come with the 
value + forcing the VALUE feature also to have a + 
value. The entry for -lich also comes with a + value 
and therefore fails to unify with the first disjunct. 
Suffixes that do not trigger umlaut come with the 
VALUE feature set to -. 
The second isjunct captures the exception for the 
-lich derivation of Hand. Because of requiring a - 
value it fails to unify with the entries for plural and 
-isch. The + value for -lich succeeds forcing at the 
same time the VALUE feature to be -.

This mechanism allows us to describe the umlaut 
phenomenon in a very general way while at the same 
time being able to deal with exceptions to the rule 
in a simple and straightforward manner. 
5.3 Using X2MORF directly for derivation 
Regarding morphotactics and morphophonology 
there is basically no difference between inflection and 
derivation. So one could use X2MORF as it is to 
cope with derivation. Derivation particles are word- 
forming heads \[di Sciullo and Williams, 1989\] that 
have to be complemented with the appropriate (sim- 
ple or complex) stems. Words that cannot be inter- 
preted compositionally anymore have to be regarded 
as monomorphemic and must be stored in the morph 
lexicon. 
Such an approach is possible but it poses some 
problems: 
* The morphological structure of words is no more 
available to succeeding processing stages. For 
some phenomena just this structural informa- 
tion is necessary though. Take as an example 
the partial deletion of words in phrases with con- 
junction (gin- und Vcrkan\]). 
? The compositional reading of a derived word 
cannot be suppressed r, even worse, it is indis- 
tinguishable from the correct reading (remem- 
ber the befehlen example). 
? Partial regularities cannot be used anymore to 
reduce redundancy. 
Therefore we have chosen instead to augment 
X2MORF with a lexeme lexicon and an explicit in- 
terface between morphological nd syntactic word. 
6 System Architecture 
Logically, the system uses two different lexica. 
A morph lexicon contains MI the morphs, i.e., 
monomorphemic stems, inflectional and derivational 
affixes. This lexicon is used by X2MORF. A iezeme 
lexicon contains the lexemes, i.e. stem morphs and 
derivational endings (because of their word-forming 
capacity). The lexical entries contain the lexeme- 
specific syntactic and semantic information under 
the feature SYNSEM. 
These two lexica can be merged into a single type 
hierarchy (see fig.6) where the morph lexicon en- 
tries are of type morph and lexeme lexicon entries 
of type lezeme. Single-stems and deriv-morphs share 
the properties of both lexica. 
ZOne could argue that the idea of preemption is incor- 
rect anyway and that only syntactic or semantic restric- 
tions block derivation. While this may be true in theory 
at least for practical considerations we will need to be 
able to block derivation in the lexicon.

Figure 6: Part of the type lattice of the lexicon 
Since we have organized our lexica in a type hier- 
archy we have already succeeded in establishing an 
inheritance hierarchy. We can now impose any of the 
structures proposed in the literature (e.g., \[Krieger 
and Nerbonne, 1991; Russell et al, 1992\]) for hierar- 
chical lexica on it, as long as they observe the same 
functor argument structure of words crucial to our 
morphotactics. 
Why are we now in a better situation than 
by using X2MORF directly? Because complex 
stems are no morphs and therefore inaccessible to 
X2MORF. They are only used in a second process- 
ing stage where complex words can be given a non- 
compositional reading. To make this possible the as- 
signing of compositional readings must also be post- 
poned to this second stage. This is attained by giving 
derivation morphs in the lexicon no feature SYNSEM 
but stating the information under FUNCTOR\]SYNSEM 
instead. 
In the first stage X2MORF processes the morpho- 
tactic information including the word-form-specific 
morphosyntactic information making use of the 
morph lexicon. The result is a feature-description 
containing the morphotactic structure and the mor- 
phosyntactic information ofthe processed word form. 
What has also been constructed is a value for the 
STEM feature that is used as an index to the lexeme 
lexicon in the second processing stage, s 
In the second stage we have to discriminate be- 
tween the following cases: 
? The stem is found in the lexeme lexicon. In case 
of a monomorphemic stem processing is com- 
pleted because the relevant syntactic/semantic 
information has already been constructed ur- 
ing the first stage. In case of a polymorphemic 
stem the retrieved lexical entry is unified with 
the result of the first stage, delivering the lexi- 
calized interpretation. 
SInflectional endings do not contribute to the stem. 
Also, allomorphs like irregular verb forms share a com- 
mon stem. 
The stem is not found in the lexeme lexicon. In 
that case a compositional interpretation is re- 
quired. This is achieved by unifying the result 
of stage one with the feature structure shown 
in fig.7 This activates the SYNSEM information 
of the functor-which must be either an inflec- 
tion or a derivation morph. In case of an in- 
flection morph nothing really happens. But for 
derivation morphs the syntactic/semantic infor- 
mation which has already been constructed is
bound to the feature SYNSEM. Then the process 
must recursively be applied to the argument of 
the structure. Since all monomorphemic stems 
and all derivational ffixes are stored in the lex- 
eme lexicon this search is bound to terminate.

Figure 7: Default entry in the lexeme lexicon 
How does this procedure account for the flexibility 
demanded insection 4. By keeping the compositional 
synyactic/semantic interpretation local to the rune- 
tot during morphological interpretation the decision 
is postponed to the second stage. In case there is 
no explicit entry found this compositional interpre- 
tation is just made available. 
In case of an explicit entry in the lexeme lexicon 
there is a number of different possibilities, among 
them: 
? There are just lexicalized interpretations. 
? There is a compositional swell as a lexiealized 
interpretation. 
? The compositional interpretation is restricted to 
a subset of the possible semantics of the root. 
The entries in the lexeme lexicon can easily be 
tailor-made to fit any of these possibilities.

7 A Detailed Example 
We will now illustrate the workings of the system 
using a few examples from section 4. The first ex- 
ample describes the purely compositional case. The 
verb betreten (to enter) can be regularly derived from 
treten (to enter) and the suffix be-. The sentences 
(9) Die Frau tritt \[in das Zimmer\]POBd. 
The woman enters the room. 
(10) Die Frau betritt \[das Zimmer\]oBJ. 
are semantically equivalent. The prepositional ob- 
ject of the intransitive verb treten is transformed into 
a direct object making betreten a transitive verb. A 
number of verbs derived by using the particle be- 
follows this general pattern. Figure 8 shows-a sim- 
plified version of-the lexical entry for be-. 
The SYNSEM feature of the functor contains the 
modified syntactic/semantic description. Note that 
the lexical entry itself contains no SYNSEM feature. 
When analyzing a surface form of the word betreten 
this functor is combined with the feature structure 
for treten (shown in fig.9) as argument. 
At that stage the FUNCTORISYNSEM feature of be- 
is unified with the SYNSEM feature of treten. But 
there is still no value set for the SYNSEM feature. 
This is intended because it allows to disregard the 
composition i favour of a direct interpretation f the 
derived word. In our example we will find no entry 
for the stem betreten though. We therefore have to 
take the default approach which means unifying the 
result with the structure shown in fig.7. 
Up to now our example was overly simplified be- 
cause it did not take into account hat treten has 
a second reading, namely to kick. The final lexical 
entry for treten is shown in fig.10. 
But this second reading of treten cannot be used 
for deriving a second meaning of betreten: 
(11) Die Frau 1tilt \[den Huna~oss. 
The woman kicks the dog. 
(12) *Die Frau betritt \[den Hnna~oB.~. 
We therefore need to block the second compositional 
interpretation. This is achieved by an explicit entry 
for betreten in the lexeme lexicon which is shown in 
fig.ll.

Figure 11: Entry for betreten in the lexeme lexicon 
We now get the desired results. While both read- 
ings of treten produce a syntactic/semantic interpre- 
tation in the first stage the incorrect one is filtered 
out by applying the lexeme lexicon entry for betreten 
in the second stage. 
8 Conclusion 
In this paper we have presented a morphological na- 
lyzer/generator that combines an extended two-level 
morphology with a feature-based word grammar that 
deals with inflection as well as derivation. The gram- 
mar works on a lexicon containing both morphs and 
lexemes. 
The system combines the main advantage of two- 
level morphology, namely the adequate treatment of 
morphophonology with the advantages of feature- 
based inheritance l xica. The system is able to auto- 
matically deduce a compositional interpretation for 
derived words not explicitly contained in the sys- 
tem's lexicon. Lexicalized compounds may be en- 
tered explicitly while retaining the information about 
their morphological structure. That way one can im- 
plement blocking (suppressing compositional read- 
ings) but is not forced to do so.
