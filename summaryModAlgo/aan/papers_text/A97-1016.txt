Abstract  
We describe and experimentally evaluate 
a complete method for the automatic ac- 
quisition of two-level rules for morphologi- 
cal analyzers/generators. The input to the 
system is sets of source-target word pairs, 
where the target is an inflected form of the 
source. There are two phases in the acquisi- 
tion process: (1) segmentation fthe target 
into morphemes and (2) determination of
the optimal two-level rule set with minimal 
discerning contexts. In phase one, a mini- 
mal acyclic finite state automaton (AFSA) 
is constructed from string edit sequences of 
the input pairs. Segmentaiion of the words 
into morphemes i achieved through view- 
ing the AFSA as a directed acyclic graph 
(DAG) and applying heuristics using prop- 
erties of the DAG as well as the elemen- 
tary edit operations. For phase two, the 
determination of the optimal rule set is 
made possible with a novel representation 
of rule contexts, with morpheme bound- 
aries added, in a new DAG. We introduce 
the notion of a delimiter edge. Delimiter 
edges are used to select the correct two- 
level rule type as well as to extract minimal 
discerning rule contexts from the DAG. Re- 
sults are presented for English adjectives, 
Xhosa noun locatives and Afrikaans noun 
plurals. 
1 Introduct ion 
Computational systems based on the two-level 
model of morphology (Koskenniemi, 1983) have been 
remarkably successful for many languages (Sproat, 
1992). The language specific information of such a 
system is stored as 
1. a morphotactic description of the words to be 
processed as well as 
2. a set of two-level morphonological (or spelling) 
rules. 
Up to now, these two components had to be coded 
largely by hand, since no automated method existed 
to acquire a set of two-level rules for input source- 
target word pairs. To hand-code a 100% correct 
rule set from word pairs becomes almost impossi- 
ble when a few hundred pairs are involved. Fur- 
thermore, there is no guarantee that such a hand 
coded lexicon does not contain redundant rules or 
rules with too large contexts. The usual approach 
is rather to construct general rules from small sub- 
sets of the input pairs. However, these general rules 
usually allow overrecognition a d overgeneration - -  
even on the subsets from which they were inferred. 
Simons (Simons, 1988) describes methods for 
studying morphophonemic alternations (using anno- 
tated interlinear text) and Grimes (Grimes, 1983) 
presents a program for discovering affix posi- 
tions and cooccurrence restrictions. Koskenniemi 
(Koskenniemi, 1990) provides a sketch of a discovery 
procedure for phonological two-level rules. Golding 
and Thompson (Golding and Thompson, 1985) and 
Wothke (Wothke, 1986) present systems to automat- 
icaily calculate a set of word-formation rules. These 
rules are, however, ordered one-level rewrite rules 
and not unordered two-level rules, as in our system. 
Kuusik (Kuusik, 1996) also acquires ordered one- 
level rewrite rules, for stem sound changes in Esto- 
nian. Daelemans et al (Daelemans el al., 1996) use 
a general symbolic machine learning program to ac- 
quire a decision tree for matching Dutch nouns to 
their correct diminutive suffixes. The input to their 
process is the syllable structure of the nouns and a 
given set of five suffix allomorphs. They do not learn 
rules for possible sound changes. Our process au- 
tomatically acquires the necessary two-level sound 
changing rules for prefix and suffix allomorphs, as 
well as the rules for stem sound changes. Connec- 
tionist work on the acquisition of morphology has 
been more concerned with implementing psycholog- 
ically motivated models, than with acquisition of 
rules for a practical system ((Sproat, 1992, p.216) 
and (Gasser, 1994)). 
The contribution of this paper is to present a com- 
plete method for the automatic acquisition of an op- 
103 
timal set of two-level rules (i.e. the second com- 
ponent above) for source-target word pairs. It is 
assumed that the target word is formed from the 
source through the addition of a prefix and/or a 
suffix 1. Furthermore, we show how a partial acqui- 
sition of the morphotactic description (component 
one) results as a by-product of the rule-acquisition 
process. For example, the morphotactic description 
of the target word in the input pair 
\[1\] 
Source Target 
happy happier 
is computed as 
\[2\] 
happier = happy + er 
The right-hand side of this morphotactic description 
is then mapped on the left-hand side, 
\[z\] 
happy+er  
happ i  0 e r  
For this example the two-level rule 
\[ 4\] 
y:i ?~ p:p - 
can be derived. These processes are described in de- 
tail in the rest of the paper: Section 2 provides an 
overview of the two-level rule formalism, Section 3 
describes the acquisition of morphotactics through 
segmentation and Section 4 presents the method for 
computing the optimal two-level rules. Section 5 
evaluates the experimental results and Section 6 
summarizes. 
2 Two- leve l  Ru le  Formal i sm 
Two-level rules view a word as having a lezical and 
a surface representation, with a correspondence b - 
tween them (Antworth, 1990), e.g.: 
\[51 
Lexical: h appy  + e r 
Surface: h app i  0 e r 
Each pair of lexical and surface characters i called 
a feasible pair. A feasible pair can be written as 
lezicabcharac~er:surface-charac~er. Such a pair is 
called a default pair when the lexicai character and 
surface character are identical (e.g. h:h). When the 
lexical and surface character differ, it is called a spe- 
cial pair (e.g. y:i). The null character (0) may ap- 
pear as either a lexical character (as in +:0) or a 
surface character, but not as both. 
1Non-linear operations (such as infixation) are not 
considered here, since the basic two-level model deals 
with it in a round-about way. We can note that exten- 
sions to the basic two-level model have been proposed to 
handle non-linear morphology (Kiraz, 1996). 
Two-level rules have the following syntax (Sproat, 
1992, p.145): 
\[ 6\] 
CP op LC _ RC 
ce  (correspondence part), LC (le# contezt) and ac  
(right contez~) are regular expressions over the al- 
phabet of feasible pairs. In most, if not all, imple- 
mentations based on the two-level model, the corre- 
spondence part consists of a single special pair. We 
also consider only single pair CPs in this paper. The 
operator op is one of four types: 
1. Exclusion rule: a:b /~  LC  _ RC 
2. Context restriction rule: a:b ::~ LC  _ RC 
3. Surface coercion rule: a:b ~ LC  _ RC 
4. Composite rule: a:b ?V LC  _ RC 
The exclusion rule ( /~)  is used to prohibit the ap- 
plication of another, too general rule, in a particular 
subcontext. Since our method does not overgener- 
alize, we will consider only the ~,  ~ and ~:~ rule 
types. 
3 Acqu is i t ion  o f  Morphotact i cs  
The morphotactics of the input words are acquired 
by (1) computing the string edit difference between 
each source-target pair and (2) merging the edit se- 
quences as a minimal acyclic finite state automa- 
ton. The automaton, viewed as a DAG, is used to 
segment he target word into its constituent mor- 
phemes. 
3.1 Determin ing  St r ing Edi t  Sequences  
A string edit sequence is a sequence of elementary 
operations which change a source string into a tar- 
get string (Sankoff and Kruskal, 1983, Chapter 1). 
The elementary operations used in this paper are 
single character deletion (DELETE), insertion (IN- 
SERT) and replacement (REPLACE). We indicate 
the copying of a character by NOCHANGE. A cost 
is associated with each elementary operation. Typ- 
ically, INSERT and DELETE have the same (posi- 
tive) cost and NOCHANGE has a cost of zero. RE- 
PLACE could have the same or a higher cost than 
INSERT or DELETE. Edit sequences can be ranked 
by the sum of the costs of the elementary opera- 
tions that appear in them. The interesting edit se- 
quences are those with the lowest total cost. For 
most word pairs, there are more than one edit se- 
quence (or mapping) possible which have the same 
minimal total cost. To select a single edit sequence 
which will most likely result in a correct segmen- 
tation, we added a morphology-specific heuristic to 
a general string edit algorithm (Vidal et al, 1995). 
This heuristic always selects an edit sequence con- 
taining two subsequences which identify prefix-root 
and root-suffix boundaries. The heuristic depends 
104 
on the elementary operations being limited only to 
INSERT, DELETE and NOCHANGE, i.e. no RE- 
PLACEs are allowed. We assume that the tar- 
get word contains more morphemes than the source 
word. It therefore follows that there are more IN- 
SERTs than DELETEs in an edit sequence. Fur- 
thermore, the letters forming the morphemes of the 
target word appear only as the right-hand compo- 
nents of INSERT operations. Consider the edit se- 
quence to change the string happy into the string 
unhappier: 
0:u INSERT 
0:n INSERT 
h:h NOCHANGE 
a:a NOCHANGE 
p:p NOCHANGE 
p:p NOCHANGE 
y:0 DELETE 
0:i INSERT 
0:e INSERT 
0:r INSERT 
\[7\] 
Note that the prefix un- as well as the suffix - 
er consist only of INSERTs. Furthermore, the 
prefix-root morpheme boundary is associated with 
an INSERT followed by a NOCHANGE and the 
root-suffix boundary by a NOCHANGE-DELETE-  
INSERT sequence. In general, the prefix-root 
boundary is just the reverse of the root-suffix bound- 
ary, i.e. INSERT-DELETE-NOCHANGE,  with the 
DELETE operation being optional. The heuristic 
resulting from this observation is a bias giving high- 
est precedence to INSERT operations, followed by 
DELETE and NOCHANGE, in the first half of the 
edit sequence. In the second half, the precedence is
reversed. 
3.2 Merg ing  Edi t  Sequences  
A single source-target edit sequence may contain 
spurious INSERTs which are not considered to form 
part of a morpheme. For example, the O:i insertion 
in Example 7 should not contribute to the suffix - 
er to form -ier, since -ier is an allomorph of -er. 
To combat these spurious INSERTs, all the edit se- 
quences for a set of source-target words are merged 
as follows: A minimal acyclic finite state automaton 
(AFSA) is constructed which accepts all and only 
the edit sequences as input strings. This AFSA is 
then viewed as a DAG, with the elementary edit op- 
erations as edge labels. For each edge a count is kept 
of the number of different edit sequences which pass 
through it. A path segment in the DAG consisting 
of one or more INSERT operations having a simi- 
lar count, is then considered to be associated with a 
morpheme in the target word. The O:e O:r INSERT 
sequence associated with the -er suffix appears more 
times than the O:i O:e O:r INSERT sequence asso- 
ciated with the - ier suffix, even in a small set of 
adjectively-related source-target pairs. This means 
that there is a rise in the edge counts from O:i to O:e 
(indicating a root-suffix boundary), while O:e and 
O:r have similar frequency counts. For prefixes a fall 
in the edge frequency count of an INSERT sequence 
indicates a prefix-root boundary. 
To extract the morphemes of each target word, 
every path through the DAG is followed and only 
the target-side of the elementary operations erving 
as edge labels, are written out. The null characters 
(0) on the target-side of DELETEs are ignored while 
the target-side of INSERTs are only written if their 
frequency counts indicate that they are not sporadic 
allomorph INSERT operations. For Example 7, the 
following morphotactic description results: 
is\] 
Target Word -- Prefix + Source + Suffix 
unhappier = un + happy + er 
Phase one can segment only one layer of affix ad- 
ditions at a time. However, once the morpheme 
boundary markers (+) have been inserted, phase 
two should be able to acquire the correct two-level 
rules for an arbitrary number of affix additions: 
prefizl  +prefiz2+. . . +roo~+suffizl +suff iz2+ . . . .  
4 Acquiring Optimal Rules 
To acquire the optimal rules, we first determine 
the full length lexical-sufface representation of each 
word pair. This representation is required for writ- 
ing two-level rules (Section 2). The morphotactic de- 
scriptions from the previous section provide source- 
target input pairs from which new string edit se- 
quences are computed: The right-hand side of the 
morphotactic description is used as the source and 
the left-hand side as the target string. For instance, 
Example 8 is written as: 
\[ 9\] 
Source: un+happy+er 
Target: unhappier 
The edit sequence 
\[ 10\] 
u:u n:n -t-:O h:h a:a p:p p:p y:i 4 :0  e:e r:r 
maps the source into the target and provides the 
lexical and surface representation required by the 
two-level rules: 
\[ 11\] 
Lexical: u n + h a pp  y + e r 
Surface: u n 0 h a pp i  0 e r 
The REPLACE elementary string edit operations 
(e.g. y:i) are now allowed since the morpheme 
boundary markers (+) are already present in the 
source string. REPLACEs allow shorter edit se- 
quences to be computed, since one REPLACE does 
105 
the same work as an adjacent INSERT-DELETE 
pair. REPLACE, INSERT and DELETE have the 
same associated cost and NOCHANGE has a cost 
of zero. The morpheme boundary marker (+) is 
always mapped to the null character (0), which 
makes for linguistically more understandable map- 
pings. Under these conditions, the selection of any 
minimal cost string edit mapping provides an ac- 
ceptable lexical-surface representation 2. 
To formulate a two-level rule for the source-target 
pair happy-unhappier, we need a correspondence 
pair (CP) and a rule type (op), as well as a left con- 
text (LC) and a right context (RC) (see Section 2). 
Rules need only be coded for special pairs, i.e. IN- 
SERTs, DELETEs or REPLACEs. The only special 
pair in the above example is y:i, which will be the 
CP of the rule. Now the question arises as to how 
large the context of this rule must be? It should 
be large enough to uniquely specify the positions 
in the lexical-surface input stream where the rule 
is applied. On the other hand, the context should 
not be too large, resulting in an overspecified con- 
text which prohibits the application of the rule to 
unseen, but similar, words. Thus to make a rule as 
general as possible, its context (LC and RC) should 
be as short as possible s . By inspecting the edit se- 
quence in Example 10, we see that y changes into 
i when y is preceded by a p:p, which serves as our 
first attempt at a (left) context for y:i. Two ques- 
tions must be asked to determine the correct rule 
type to be used (Antworth, 1990, p.53): 
Quest ion  1 Is E the only environment in which L:S 
is allowed? 
Quest ion  2 Must L always be realized as S in E? 
The term environment denotes the combined left 
and right contexts of a special l~air. E in our ex- 
ample is "p:p_", L is y and S is i. Thus the answer 
to question one is true, since y:i only occurs after 
p:p in our example. The answer to question two is 
also true, since y is always realized as i after a p:p 
in the above edit sequence. Which rule type to use 
is gleaned from Table 1. Thus, to continue our ex- 
ample, we should use the composite rule type (?:~): 
\[ 12\] 
y:i ?~ p:p _ 
2Our assumption is that such a minimal cost mapping 
will lead to an optimal rule set. In most (if not all) of the 
examples een, a minimal mapping was also intuitively 
acceptable. 
sit abstractions (e.g. sets such as V denoting vow- 
els) over the regular pairs are introduced, it will not be 
so simple to determine what is "a more general con- 
text". However, current implementations require ab- 
stractions to be explicitly instantiated during the compi- 
lation process ((Karttunen and Beesley, 1992, pp.19-21) 
and (Antworth, 1990, pp.49-50)) . Thus, with the cur- 
rent state of the art, abstractions serve only to make the 
rules more readable.

Table 1: Truth table to select the correct rule type. 
This example shows how to go about coding the 
set of two-level rules for a single source-target pair. 
However, this soon becomes a tedious and error 
prone task when the number of source-target pairs 
increases, due to the complex interplay of rules and 
their contexts. 
4.1 M in ima l  D iscern ing  Ru le  Contexts  
It is important o acquire the minimal discerning 
context for each rule. This ensures that the rules 
are as general as possible (to work on unseen words 
as well) and prevents rule conflicts. Recall that one 
need only code rules for the special pairs. Thus it 
is necessary to determine a rule type with associ- 
ated minimal discerning context for each occurrence 
of a special pair in the final edit sequences. This is 
done by comparing all the possible contiguous 4 con- 
texts of a special pair against all the possible con- 
texts of all the other feasible pairs. To enable the 
computational comparison of the growing left and 
right contexts around a feasible pair, we developed 
a "mixed-context" representation. We call the par- 
ticular feasible pair for which a mixed-context is to 
be constructed, a marker pair (MP), to distinguish 
it from the feasible pairs in its context. The mixed- 
context representation is created by writing the first 
feasible pair to the left of the marker pair, then the 
first right-context pair, then the second left-context 
pair and so forth: 
\[ 13\] 
LC1, RC1, LC2, RC2, LC3, RC3, . . . ,  MP 
The marker pair at the end serves as a label. Special 
symbols indicate the start (SOS) and end (EOS) of 
an edit sequence. If, say, the right-context o fa  MP is 
shorter than the left-context, an out-of-bounds sym- 
bol (OOB) is used to maintain the mixed-context 
format. For example the mixed-context of y:i in the 
edit sequence in Example 10, is represented as: 
\[ 14\] 
p:p, +:0, p:p, e:e, a:a, r:r, h:h, EOS, +:0, OOB, 
n:n, OOB, u:u, SOS, OOB, y:i 
The common prefixes of the mixed-contexts are 
merged by constructing a minimal AFSA which ac- 
cepts all and only these mixed-context sequences. 
4A two-level rule requires a contiguous context. 
106 
Question 2 
have the 
The transitions (or edges, when viewed as a DAG) of 
the AFSA are labeled with the feasible pairs and spe- 
cial symbols in the mixed-context sequence. There 
is only one final state for this minimal AFSA. Note 
that all and only the terminal edges leading to this 
final state will be labeled with the marker pairs, 
since they appear at the end of the mixed-context 
sequences. More than one terminal edge may be la- 
beled with the same marker pair. All the possible 
(mixed) contexts of a specific marker pair can be 
recovered by following every path from the root to 
the terminal edges labeled with that marker pair. 
I f  a path is traversed only up to an intermediate 
edge, a shortened context surrounding the marker 
pair can be extracted. We will call such an interme- 
diate edge a de l imi te r  edge,  since it delimits a short- 
ened context. For example, traversing the mixed 
context path of y: i  in Example 14 up to e:e would 
result in the (unmixed) shortened context: 
\[ 25\] 
p:p  p :p  _ +:0  e:e 
From the shortened context we can write a two-level 
rule 
\[ 26\] 
y: i  op p:p  p :p  _ ?:0  e:e 
which is more general than a rule using the full con- 
text: 
\[ 27\] 
y:i  op SOS u:u  n :n  h:h a:a p :p  p :p  _ +:0  e:e r:r 
EOS 
For each marker pair in the DAG which is also a 
special pair, we want to find those delimiter edges 
which produce the shortest contexts providing a t rue  
answer to at least one of the two rule type de- 
cision questions given above. The mixed-context 
prefix-merged AFSA, viewed as a DAG, allow us to 
rephrase the two questions in order to find answers 
in a procedural way: 
Quest ion  1 Traverse all the paths from the root 
to the terminal edges labeled with the marker 
pair L :S .  Is there an edge el in the DAG which 
all these paths have in common? If so, then 
question one is t rue  for the environment E con- 
structed from the shortened mixed-contexts a - 
sociated with the path prefixes delimited by el. 
Consider the terminal edges which 
same L-component as the marker pair 
L :S  and which are reachable from a common 
edge e2 in the DAG. Do all of these terminal 
edges also have the same S-component as the 
marker pair? If so, then question two is t rue  for 
the environment E constructed from the short- 
ened mixed-contexts associated with the path 
prefixes delimited by e2. 
For each marker pair, we traverse the DAG and mark 
the delimiter edges neares t  to the root which allow 
a true answer to either question one, question two 
or both (i.e. el = e2). This means that each path 
from the root to a terminal edge can have at most 
three marked delimiter edges: One delimiting a con- 
text for a ~ rule, one delimiting a context for a 
rule and one delimiting a context for a ~ rule. The 
marker pair used to answer the two questions, serves 
as the correspondence part (Section 2) of the rule. 
To continue with Example 14, let us assume that the 
DAG edge labeled with e:e is the closest edge to the 
root which answers true only to question one. Then 
the ~ rule is indicated: 
\[ IS\] 
y: i  ~ p :p  p :p  _ +:0  e:e 
However, if the edge labeled with r:r answers true 
to both questions, we prefer the composite rule (?#) 
associated with it although this results in a larger 
context: 
\[19\] 
y: i  ?* a:a p :p  p :p  _ ?:0  e:e r : r  
The reasons for this preference are that the ?~ rule 
? provides a more precise statement about the ap- 
plicable environment of the rule and it 
? seems to be preferred in systems designed by 
linguistic experts. 
Furthermore, from inspecting examples, a delimiter 
edge indicating a ~ rule generally delimits the short- 
est contexts, followed by the delimiter for ?~ and 
the delimiter for ~ .  The shorter the selected con- 
text, the more generally applicable is the rule. We 
therefore select only one rule per path, in the fol- 
lowing preference order: (1) ?~, (2) ~ and (3) ~ .  
Note that any of the six possible precedence orders 
would provide an accurate analysis and generation 
of the pairs used for learning. However, our sug- 
gested precedence seems to strike the best balance 
between over- or underrecognition and over- or un- 
dergeneration when the rules would be applied to 
unseen pairs. 
The mixed-context representation has one obvious 
drawback: If an optimal rule has only a left or only 
a right context, it cannot be acquired. To solve this 
problem, two additional minimal AFSAs are con- 
structed: One containing only the left context in- 
formation for all the marker pairs and one contain- 
ing only the right context information. The same 
process is then followed as with the mixed contexts. 
The final set of rules is selected from the output of 
all three the AFSAs: For each special pair 
1. we select any of the ?~ rules with the shortest 
contexts of which the special pair is the left- 
hand side, or 
107 
2. if no ?~ rules were found, we select the shortest 
and ~ rules for each occurrence of the special 
pair. They are then merged into a single ?~ rule 
with disjuneted contexts. 
The rule set learned is complete since all possible 
combinations of marker pairs, rule types and con- 
texts are considered by traversing all three DAGs. 
Furthermore, the rules in the set have the shortest 
possible contexts, since, for a given DAG, there is 
only one delimiter edge closest to the root for each 
path, marker pair and rule type combination. 
5 Results and Evaluation 
Our process works correctly for examples given in 
(Antworth, 1990). There were two incorrect seg- 
mentations in the twenty one adjective pairs given 
on page 106. It resulted from an incorrect string edit 
mapping of (un)happy to (un)happily. For the suf- 
fix, the sequence . .. O:i O:l y:y was generated instead 
of the sequence.. ,  y:O O:i 0:I O:y. The reason for this 
is that the root word and the inflected form end in 
the same letter (y) and one NOCHANGE (y:y) has 
a lower cost than a DELETE (y:O) plus an INSERT 
(O:y). The acquired segmentation for the 21 pairs, 
with the suffix segmentation of (un)happily manu- 
ally corrected, is: 
\[ 20\] 
Target : Prefix + Source + Suffix 
bigger = big + er 
biggest = big + est 
unclear = un + clear 
unclearly -- un + clear ? ly 
unhappy = un + happy 
unhappier = un + happy ? er 
unhappiest = un ? happy + est 
unhappily : un + happy ? ly 
unreal = un + real 
cooler = cool -4- er 
coolest = cool -4- est 
coolly = cool -4- ly 
clearer -= clear -4- er 
clearest : clear -4- est 
clearly = clear -4- ly 
redder : red -4- er 
reddest = red + est 
really : real + ly 
happier : happy -4- er 
happiest : happy -4- est 
happily = happy -4- ly 
From these segmentations, the morphotactic com- 
ponent (Section 1) required by the morphological 
analyzer/generator is generated with uncomplicated 
text-processing routines. Three correct ~ rules, 
including two gemination rules, resulted for these 
twenty one pairsS:

level processor PC-KIMMO (Antworth, 1990). The two-

To better illustrate the complexity of the rules 
that can be learned automatically by our process, 
consider the following set of fourteen Xhosa noun- 
locative pairs: 
Source Word --~ Target Word 
inkosi --~ enkosini 
iinkosi ~ ezinkosini 
ihashe -~ ehasheni 
imbewu -~ embewini

ingubo - ,  engutyeni 
indlu - ,  endlini 
indlu --~ endlwini

Note that this set contains ambiguity: The locative 
of ingubo is either engubeni or engutyeni. Our pro- 
cess must learn the necessary two-level rules to map 
ingubo to engubeni and engutyeni, as well as to map 
both engubeni and engutyeni in the other direction, 
i.e. to ingubo. Similarly, indlu and ikhaya each 
have two different locative forms. Furthermore, the 
two source words inkosi and iinkosi (the plural of 
inkosi) differ only by a prefixed i, but they have dif- 
ferent locative forms. This small difference between 
source words provides an indication of the sensitiv- 
ity required of the acquisition process to provide the 
necessary discerning information to a two-level mor- 
phological processor. At the same time, our pro- 
cess needs to cope with possibly radical modifica- 
tions between source and target words. Consider 
the mapping between ubuchopho and its locative 
ebucotsheni. Here, the only segments which stay 
the same from the source to the target word, are the 
three letters -buc-, the letter -o -  (the deletion of 
the first -h -  is correct) and the second -h - .  
The target words are correctly segmented uring 
phase one as: 
level rule compiler KGEN (developed by Nathan Miles) 
was used to compile the acquired rules into the state 
tables required by PC-KIMMO. Both PC-KIMMO and 
KGEN are available from the Summer Institute of Lin- 
guistics.

The ~ and ~ rules of  a special pair can be merged 
into a single ~=~ rule. For example the four rules 
above for the special pair q-:O can be merged into

because both the two questions becomes t rue  for 
the dis juncted environment e:e _ I o :y  _ I u :w - I - 
n :n .  The vertical bar ("1") is the t rad i t iona l  two- 
level notat ion which indicate the dis junct ion of two 
(or more) contexts. The five ~ rules and the single 
rule of the special pair i:O in Example  24 can be 
merged in a similar way. In this instance, the context 
of the ~ rule (4- :0 -) needs to be added to some of 
the contexts of the ~ rules of i:O. The following ?:~ 
rule results: 
\[26\] 
i:O ~ 4-:0 - n :n  I 4-:0 _ h:h I 4-:0 _ k:k I 4-:0 - l:l I 
4-:0 _ m:m 
In this way the 24 rules are reduced to a set of 16 
rules which contain only a single ?~ rule for each 
special pair. This merged set of 16 two-level rules 
analyze and generate the input  word pairs 100% cor- 
rectly. 
The next step was to show the feasibi l i ty of au- 
tomat ica l ly  acquir ing a min imal  rule set for a wide 
coverage parser. To get hundreds or even thousands 
of input pairs, we implemented routines to extract  
the lemmas ("head words") and their inflected forms 
from a machine-readable dict ionary.  In this way 
we extracted 3935 Afr ikaans noun-plural  pairs which 
served as the input to our process. Afr ikaans plu- 
rals are almost always derived with the addi t ion of 
a suffix (mostly -e  or - s )  to the singular form. Dif- 
ferent sound changes may occur dur ing this process. 
For example 6, geminat ion,  which indicates the short- 
ening of a preceding vowel, occurs frequently (e.g. 
hat  ---* kat te ) ,  as well as consonant- insert ion (e.g. 
has  ---* haste )  and elision (ampseed --~ ampsede) .  
Several sound changes may occur in the same word. 
For example, elision, consonant replacement and 
geminat ion occurs in l oo f  ---* lowwe.  Afr ikaans (a 
Germanic  language) has borrowed a few words from 
Latin. Some of these words have two plural  forms, 
which introduces ambigui ty  in the word mappings:  
One plural  is formed with a Lat in suffix ( -a )  (e.g. 
emet ikum --~ emet ika)  and one with an indigenous 
suffix (-s) (emetih.m emetih ms). Allomorphs 
occur as well, for example -ens  is an a l lomorph of 
the suffix - s  in bed + s ---, beddens .  
During phase one, all but eleven (0.3%) of the 
3935 input word pairs were segmented correctly. To 
faci l i tate the evaluat ion of phase two, we define a 
s imple  ru le  as a rule which has an environment con- 
sisting of a single context. This is in contrast  with 
an environment consisting of two or more contexts 
dis juncted together. Phase two acquired 531 s imple  
ru les  for 44 special pairs. Of these 531 simple rules, 
500 are ~ rules, nineteen are ?~ rules and twelve 
are ~ rules. The average length of the simple rule 
contexts is 4.2 feasible pairs. Compare this with the 
nAil the examples comes from the 3935 input word 
pairs. 
109 
average length of the 3935 final input edit sequences 
which is 12.6 feasible pairs. The 531 simple rules 
can be reduced to 44 ~ rules (i.e. one rule per spe- 
cial pair) with environments consisting ofdisjuncted 
contexts. These 44 ~ rules analyze and generate the 
3935 word pairs 100% correctly. The total number 
of feasible pairs in the 3935 final input edit strings 
is 49657. In the worst case, all these feasible pairs 
should be present in the rule contexts to accurately 
model the sound changes which might occur in the 
input pairs. However, the actual result is much bet- 
ter: Our process acquires a two-level rule set which 
accurately models the sound changes with only 4.5% 
(2227) of the input feasible pairs. 
To obtain a prediction of the analysis and gener- 
ation accuracy over unseen words, we divided the 
3935 input pairs into five equal sections. Each fifth 
was held out in turn as test data while a set of 
two-level rules was learned from the remaining four- 
fifths. The average recognition accuracy as well as 
the generation accuracy over the held out test data 
is 93.9%. 
6 Summary  
We have described and experimentally evaluated, for 
the first time, a process which automatically ac- 
quires optimal two-level morphological rules from 
input word pairs. These can be used by a pub- 
licly available two-level morphological processor. We 
have demonstrated that our acquisition process is 
portable between at least three different languages 
and that an acquired rule set generalizes well to 
words not in the training corpus. Finally, we have 
shown the feasibility of automatically acquiring two- 
level rule sets for wide-coverage parsers, with word 
pairs extracted from a machine-readable dictionary.
