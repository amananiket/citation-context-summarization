Abstract
Inspired by the success of English
grapheme-to-phoneme research in speech
synthesis, many researchers have pro-
posed phoneme-based English-to-Chinese
transliteration models. However, such ap-
proaches have severely suffered from the
errors in Chinese phoneme-to-grapheme
conversion. To address this issue,
we propose a new English-to-Chinese
transliteration model and make system-
atic comparisons with the conventional
models. Our proposed model relies on
the joint use of Chinese phonemes and
their corresponding English graphemes
and phonemes. Experiments showed that
Chinese phonemes in our proposed model
can contribute to the performance im-
provement in English-to-Chinese translit-
eration.
1 Introduction
1.1 Motivation
Transliteration, i.e., phonetic translation, is com-
monly used to translate proper names and techni-
cal terms across languages. A variety of English-
to-Chinese machine transliteration models has
been proposed in the last decade (Meng et al,
2001; Gao et al, 2004; Jiang et al, 2007; Lee
and Chang, 2003; Li et al, 2004; Li et al, 2007;
Wan and Verspoor, 1998; Virga and Khudanpur,
2003). They can be categorized into those based
on Chinese phonemes (Meng et al, 2001; Gao
et al, 2004; Jiang et al, 2007; Lee and Chang,
2003; Wan and Verspoor, 1998; Virga and Khu-
danpur, 2003) and those that don?t rely on Chinese
phonemes (Li et al, 2004; Li et al, 2007).
Inspired by the success of English grapheme-to-
phoneme research in speech synthesis, many re-
searchers have proposed phoneme-based English-
to-Chinese transliteration models. In these ap-
proaches, Chinese phonemes are generated from
English graphemes or phonemes, and then the
Chinese phonemes are converted into Chinese
graphemes (or characters), where Chinese Pinyin
strings1 are used for representing a syllable-level
Chinese phoneme sequence. Despite its high ac-
curacy in generating Chinese phonemes from En-
glish, this approach has severely suffered from er-
rors in Chinese phoneme-to-grapheme conversion,
mainly caused by Chinese homophone confusion
? one Chinese Pinyin string can correspond to sev-
eral Chinese characters (Li et al, 2004). For ex-
ample, the Pinyin string ?LI? corresponds to such
different Chinese characters as,, and. For
this reason, it has been reported that English-to-
Chinese transliteration without Chinese phonemes
outperforms that with Chinese phonemes (Li et al,
2004).
Then ?Can Chinese phonemes improve
English-to-Chinese transliteration, if we can re-
duce the errors in Chinese phoneme-to-grapheme
conversion?? Our research starts from this
question.
1.2 Our Approach
Previous approaches using Chinese phonemes
have relied only on Chinese phonemes in Chi-
nese phoneme-to-grapheme conversion. However,
the simple use of Chinese phonemes doesn?t al-
ways provide a good clue to reduce the ambi-
guity in Chinese phoneme-to-grapheme conver-
sion. Let us explain with an example, the Chinese
transliteration of Greeley in Table 1, where Chi-
nese phonemes are represented in terms of Chi-
nese Pinyin strings and English phonemes are rep-
resented by ARPAbet symbols2.
In Table 1, Chinese Pinyin string ?LI? corre-
sponds to two different Chinese characters, and
1Pinyin, the most commonly used Romanization sys-
tem for Chinese characters, faithfully represents Chinese

sponding Chinese characters in Chinese transliter-
ation of Greeley

English phoneme G R IY L IY
Chinese Pinyin GE LI LI
Chinese character   
. It seems difficult to find evidence for select-
ing the correct Chinese character corresponding to
each Chinese Pinyin string ?LI? by just looking
at the sequence of Chinese Pinyin strings ?GE LI
LI.? However, English graphemes (ree and ley) or
phonemes (?R IY? and ?L IY?) corresponding to
Chinese Pinyin string ?LI?, especially their conso-
nant parts (r and l in the English graphemes and
?R? and ?L? in the English phonemes), provide
strong evidence to resolve the ambiguity. Thus,
we can easily find rules for the conversion from
Chinese Pinyin string ?LI? to and as follows:
? ? ?R IY?, LI ? ?
? ? ?L IY?, LI ? ?
Based on the observation, we propose an
English-to-Chinese transliteration model based on
the joint use of Chinese phonemes and their corre-
sponding English graphemes and phonemes. We
define a set of English-to-Chinese transliteration
models and categorize them into the following
three classes:
? M
I
: Models Independent of Chinese
phonemes
? M
S
: Models based on Simple use of Chinese
phonemes
? M
J
: Models based on Joint use of Chi-
nese phonemes and English graphemes and
phonemes that correspond to our proposed
model.
Our comparison among the three types of translit-
eration models can be summarized as follows.
? The M
I
models relying on either English
graphemes or phonemes could not outper-
form those based on both English graphemes
and phonemes.

? The M
S
models always showed the worst
performance due to the severe error rate in
Chinese phoneme-to-grapheme conversion.
? The M
J
models significantly reduced er-
rors in Chinese phoneme-to-grapheme con-
version; thus they achieved the best perfor-
mance.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 introduces the notations used through-
out this paper. Section 3 describes the translitera-
tion models we compared. Section 4 describes our
tests and results. Section 5 concludes the paper
with a summary.
2 Preliminaries
Let E
G
be an English word composed of n English
graphemes, and let E
P
be a sequence of English
phonemes that represents the pronunciation of E
G
.
Let C
G
be a sequence of Chinese graphemes cor-
responding to the Chinese transliteration of E
G
,
and let C
P
be a sequence of Chinese phonemes
that represents the pronunciation of C
G
.
C
P
corresponds to a sequence of the Chinese
Pinyin strings of C
G
. Because a Chinese Pinyin
string represents the pronunciation of a sylla-
ble consisting of consonants and vowels, we di-
vide a Chinese Pinyin string into consonant and
vowel parts like ?L+I?, ?L+I+N?, and ?SH+A.?
In this paper, we define a Chinese phoneme
as the vowel and consonant parts in a Chinese
Pinyin string (e.g., ?L?, ?SH?, and ?I?). A Chi-
nese character usually corresponds to multiple
English graphemes, English phonemes, and Chi-
nese phonemes (i.e.,  corresponds to English
graphemes ree, English phonemes ?R IY?, and
Chinese phonemes ?L I? in Table 1). To repre-
sent these many-to-one correspondences, we use
the well-known BIO labeling scheme to represent
a Chinese character, where B and I represent the
beginning and inside/end of the Chinese charac-
ters, respectively, and O is not used. Each Chi-
nese phoneme corresponds to a Chinese character
with B and I labels. For example, Chinese charac-
ter ?? in Table 1 can be represented as ?:B?
and ?:I?, where ?:B? and ?:I? correspond
to Chinese phonemes ?L? and ?I?, respectively. In
this paper, we define a Chinese grapheme as a Chi-
nese character represented with a BIO label, e.g.,
?:B? and ?:I.?

Then E
P
, C
P
, and C
G
can be segmented into a
series of sub-strings, each of which corresponds to
an English grapheme in E
G
. We can thus write
? E

where eg
i
, ep
i
, cp
i
, and cg
i
represent the ith
English grapheme, English phonemes, Chinese
phonemes, and Chinese graphemes corresponding
to eg
i
, respectively.
Based on the definition, we model English-
to-Chinese transliteration so that each English
grapheme is tagged with its corresponding En-
glish phonemes, Chinese phonemes, and Chinese
graphemes. Table 2 illustrates eg
i
, ep
i
, cp
i
, and
cg
i
with the same example listed in Table 1 (En-
glish word Greeley and its corresponding Chinese
transliteration ??)3, where ? represents an
empty string.
3 Transliteration Model
We defined eighteen transliteration models to be
compared. These transliteration models are clas-
sified into three classes, M
I
, M
S
, andM
J
as de-
scribed in Section 1.2; each class has three basic
transliteration models and three hybrid ones. In
this section, we first describe the basic translit-
eration models in each class by focusing on the
main difference among the three classes and then
describe the hybrid transliteration models.
3We performed alignment between E
G
and E
P
and be-
tween E
P
and C
P
in a similar manner presented in Li et al
(2004). Then the two alignment results were merged using
E
P
as a pivot. Finally, we made a correspondence relation
among eg
i
, ep
i
, cp
i
, and cg
i
using the merged alignment re-
sult and the Pinyin table.
3.1 Basic Transliteration Models
The basic transliteration models in each class are
denoted as M(x, y).
? (x, y) ? X ? Y
? x ? X = {E
G
, E
P
, E
GP
}
? y ? Y = {?, C
P
, JC
P
}
x is an English-side parameter representing En-
glish grapheme (E
G
), English phoneme (E
P
), and
the joint use of English grapheme and phoneme
(E
GP
= ?E
G
, E
P
?) that contributes to generat-
ing Chinese phonemes or Chinese graphemes in
a transliteration model. y is a Chinese-phoneme
parameter that represents a way of using Chinese
phonemes to generate Chinese graphemes in a
transliteration model. Since M(x, ?) represents
a transliteration model that does not rely on Chi-
nese phonemes, it falls intoM
I
, while M(x, C
P
)
corresponds to a transliteration model in M
S
that
only uses Chinese phonemes in Chinese phoneme-
to-grapheme conversion. M(x, JC
P
) is a translit-
eration model in theM
J
class that generates Chi-
nese transliterations based on joint use of x and
Chinese phoneme C
P
, where x ? X . Thus,
M(x, JC
P
) can be rewritten as M(x, ?x, C
P
?),
where the joint representation of x and C
P
,
?x, C
P
?, is used in Chinese phoneme-to-grapheme
conversion. The three basic models inM
J
can be
interpreted as follows:
? M(E
G
, JC
P
) = M(E
G
, ?E
G
, C
P
?)
? M(E
P
, JC
P
) = M(E
P
, ?E
P
, C
P
?)
? M(E
GP
, JC
P
) = M(E
GP
, ?E
GP
, C
P
?)
M(E
G
, JC
P
) directly converts English
graphemes into Chinese phonemes without
the help of English phonemes and then gener-
ates Chinese transliterations based on the joint
representation of English graphemes and Chi-
nese phonemes. The main difference between
M(E
P
, JC
P
) and M(E
GP
, JC
P
) lies in the
use of English graphemes to generate Chinese
phonemes and graphemes. English graphemes
are only used in English grapheme-to-phoneme
conversion, and English phonemes play a crucial
role for generating Chinese transliteration in
M(E
P
, JC
P
). Chinese phoneme-to-grapheme
conversion that relies on the joint use of English
graphemes, English phonemes, and Chinese

phonemes is the key feature of M(E
GP
, JC
P
).
Because M(x, JC
P
) can be interpreted as
M(x, ?x, C
P
?), English-side parameter x de-
termines the English graphemes and phonemes,
or both jointly used with Chinese phonemes in
Chinese phoneme-to-grapheme conversion. Then
we can represent the three basic transliteration
models as in Eqs. (1)?(3), where P (C
G
|E
G
, C
P
),
P (C
G
|E
P
, C
P
), and P (C
G
|E
G
, E

) are the
key points in our proposed models,M
J
.
The three basic transliteration models in M
S
? M(E
G
, C
P
), M(E
P
, C
P
), and M(E
GP
, C
P
) ?
are formulated as Eqs. (4)?(6). Chinese phoneme-
based transliteration models in the literature fall
into either M(E
G
, C
P
) or M(E
P
, C
P
) (Meng et
al., 2001; Gao et al, 2004; Jiang et al, 2007; Lee
and Chang, 2003; Wan and Verspoor, 1998; Virga
and Khudanpur, 2003). The three basic transliter-
ation models inM
S
are identical as those inM
J
,
except for the Chinese phoneme-to-grapheme con-
version method. They only depend on Chinese
phonemes in Chinese phoneme-to-grapheme con-
version represented as P (C
G
|C

) in Eqs. (4)?(6).

The three basic transliteration models in M
I
are
represented in Eqs. (7)?(9). Because theM
I
mod-
els are independent of Chinese phonemes, they are
the same as the transliteration models in the lit-
erature used for machine transliteration from En-
glish to other languages without relying on target-
language phonemes (Karimi et al, 2007; Malik,
2006; Oh et al, 2006; Sherif and Kondrak, 2007;
Yoon et al, 2007). Note that M(E
G
, ?) is the
same transliteration model as the one proposed by
Li et al (2004).
3.2 Hybrid Transliteration Models
The hybrid transliteration models in each class
are defined by discrete mixture between the prob-
ability distribution of the two basic transliter-
ation models, as in Eq. (10) (Al-Onaizan and
Knight, 2002; Oh et al, 2006), where 0 < ? <
1. We denote a hybrid transliteration model be-
tween two basic transliteration models M(x
1
, y)
and M(x
2
, y) as M(x
1
+ x
2
, y, ?), where y ?

6= x

, and x

?
X = {E

, E

, E

}. In this paper, we define
three types of hybrid transliteration models in each
class: M(E
G
+ E
P
, y, ?), M(E
G
+ E
GP
, y, ?),
and M(E
P

3.3 Probability Estimation

way, we limit our focus to Eq. (3) in this section.

they can be simplified into a series of products in
Eqs. (11)?(13).
The maximum entropy model is used to esti-
mate the probabilities in Eqs. (11)?(13) (Berger
et al, 1996). Generally, a conditional maxi-
mum entropy model is an exponential model that
gives the conditional probability, as described in
Eq. (14), where ?

and f

The feature functions used here are defined in
terms of context predicates ? a function return-
ing TRUE or FALSE that depends on the presence
of the information in the current context (Ratna-
parkhi, 1997). Context predicates and their de-
scriptions used are given in Table 4.

unigrams (pair

three unigrams (triple

ferent context predicates represent the same con-

We used the ?Maximum Entropy Modeling
Toolkit?4 to estimate the probabilities and the
LBFGS algorithm to find ?

in Eq. (14). For
each transliteration model, we produced n-best
transliterations using a stack decoder (Schwartz
and Chow, 1990).
3.4 Summary
In this paper, we defined eighteen transliteration
models to be compared. There are six translitera-
tion models, three basic and three hybrid ones, in
each class, M
I
, M
S
, and M
J
. We compared the
transliteration models from the viewpoint of Chi-
nese phonemes or the class of transliteration mod-
els in our experiments.
4 Testing and Results
We used the same test set used in Li et al (2004)
for our testing5. It contains 37,694 pairs of English
words and their official Chinese transliterations

extracted from the ?Chinese Transliteration of For-
eign Personal Names? (Xinhua News Agency,
1992), which includes names in English, French,
German, and many other foreign languages (Li et
al., 2004). We used the same test data as in Li et
al. (2004). But we randomly selected 90% of the
training data used in Li et al (2004) as our training
data and the remainder as the development data, as
shown in Table 5.

tion pairs in each data set

Training data 31,299 34,777
Development data 3,478 N/A
Blind test data 2,896 2,896
We used the training data for training the
transliteration models. For each model, we tuned
the parameters including the number of iterations
for training the maximum entropy model and a
Gaussian prior for smoothing the maximum en-
tropy model using the development data. Further,
the development data was used to select param-
eter ? of the hybrid transliteration models. We
varied parameter ? from 0 to 1 in 0.1 intervals
(i.e., ?=0, 0.1, 0.2, ? ? ? ,1) and tested the perfor-
mance of the hybrid models with the development
data. Then we chose ? that showed the best per-
formance in each hybrid model. The blind test
data was used for evaluating the performance of
each transliteration model. The CMU Pronounc-
ing Dictionary6, which contains about 120,000
English words and their pronunciations, was used
for estimating P (E

).
We conducted two experiments. First, we com-
pared the overall performance of the translitera-
tion models. Second, we investigated the effect
of training data size on the performance of each
transliteration model.
The evaluation was done for word accuracy
in top-1 (ACC), Chinese pronunciation accuracy
(CPA) and a mean reciprocal rank (MRR) met-
ric (Kantor and Voorhees, 2000; Li et al, 2009;
Chang et al, 2009). ACC measures how many
correct transliterations appeared in the top-1 re-
sult of each system. CPA measures the Chinese
pronunciation accuracy in the top-1 of the n-best
Chinese pronunciation. We used CPA for com-
6Available at http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/
cgi-bin/cmudict
paring the performance between systems based on
Chinese phonemes. MRR, mean reciprocal ranks
of n-best results of each system over the test en-
tries, is an evaluation measure for n-best translit-
erations. If a transliteration generated by a system
matches a reference transliteration7 at the rth posi-
tion of the n-best results, its reciprocal rank equals
1/r; otherwise its reciprocal rank equals 0, where
1 ? r ? n. We produced 10-best Chinese translit-
erations for each English word in our experiments.
4.1 Comparison of the Overall Performance
Table 6 represents the overall performance of one
system in a previous work (Li et al, 2004) and
eighteen systems based on the transliteration mod-
els defined in this paper. ACC, MRR, and CPA
represent the evaluation results for each model
trained by our training data. To test transliteration
models without the errors introduced by incorrect
Chinese phonemes, we carried out the experiments
with the correct Chinese pronunciation (or the
correct Chinese phoneme sequence) in Chinese
phoneme-to-grapheme conversion. In the exper-
iment, we put the correct Chinese pronunciation
into the top-1 of the n-best Chinese pronunciation
with the highest probability, say P (C
P
|E
G
)=1;
thus CPA was assumed to be 100%. The ACC
of the transliteration models under this condition
is denoted as ACC? in Table 6. TRAIN represents
the evaluation results of the transliteration mod-
els trained by our training data. To compare Li
et al (2004) and transliteration models defined in
this paper under the same condition, we also car-
ried out experiments with the same training data
in Li et al (2004). Since the training data used
in Li et al (2004) is identical as the union of
our training and development data, we denoted it
as TRAIN+DEV in Table 6. In both TRAIN and
TRAIN+DEV, we used the same parameter setting
that was obtained by using the development data.
LI04 represents a system in Li et al (2004),
and its ACC? in TRAIN+DEV is taken from the
literature. The systems based on the translitera-
tion models defined in our paper are represented
from the second row in Table 6. The phoneme-
based transliteration models in the literature cor-
respond to either M(E

A comparison between the basic and hybrid
transliteration models showed that the hybrid
ones usually performed better (the exception was
M(E
P
+E
GP
, y, ?) but the performance still com-
parable to the basic ones in each class). Es-
pecially, the hybrid ones based on the best two
basic transliteration models, M(E
G
+E
GP
, y, ?),
showed the best performance.
A comparison among the M
I
, M
S
, and
M
J
models showed that Chinese phonemes did
contribute to the performance improvement of
English-to-Chinese transliteration when Chinese
phonemes were used together with their corre-
sponding English graphemes and phonemes in
Chinese phoneme-to-grapheme conversion. A
one-tail paired t-test between the M
I
and M
J
models showed that the results of the M
J
mod-
els were always significantly better than those
of the M
I
models if the M
I
and M
J
models
shared the same English-side parameter, x ?
{E
G
, E
P
, E
GP
} (level of significance = 0.001).
In the results obtained by the M
S
and M
J
mod-
els, the figures in CPA are the same when theM
S
and our M
J
models share the same English-side
parameter. Moreover, the difference between the
figures in ACC and CPA can be interpreted as
the error rate of Chinese phoneme-to-grapheme
conversion. Our proposed M
J
models gener-
ated Chinese transliterations with a very low er-
ror rate in Chinese phoneme-to-grapheme conver-
sion, while theM
S
models suffered from a signif-
icant error rate in Chinese phoneme-to-grapheme
conversion. ACC? showed that the M
J
models
still outperformed the M
S
models even without
errors in generating Chinese pronunciation from
the English words. These results indicate that the
joint use of Chinese phonemes and their corre-
sponding English graphemes and phonemes sig-
nificantly improved the performance in Chinese
phoneme-to-grapheme conversion and English-to-
Chinese transliteration.

erated by M(E

For Emily and Reinhardt, the M

models gen-
erated correct Chinese transliterations, but theM
I
models did not. Figure 1 shows the probabil-
ity distribution when a transliteration model gen-
erates the first Chinese character in the Chinese
transliteration of Reinhardt with and without Chi-
nese phonemes. Two Chinese characters,  and
, were strong candidates and  is the correct
one in this case. Without Chinese phonemes,
M(E
G
, ?), which is based on P(cg|Reinhardt)
in Figure 1(a) preferring  to , generated the
incorrect transliteration as shown in Table 7. How-
ever, Figure 1(b) shows that  can be selected
if the correct Chinese phoneme sequence ?LAI
YIN ...? is given. Three Chinese phoneme se-
quences starting with ?LAI YIN ...?, ?LAI NA
...?, and ?LAI NEI ...? were generated from Rein-
hardt, where ?LAI YIN ...? was the best Chinese
phoneme sequence based on the probability distri-
bution in Figure 1(c). As a result, M(E
G
, JC
P
),
which jointly used Chinese phonemes with En-
glish graphemes, generated the correct Chinese
transliteration of Reinhardt based on two probabil-
ity distribution in Figures 1(b) and 1(c). In the case
of Ivy, English phonemes contributed to generat-
ing the correct transliteration in the M(E

Chinese transliterations sometimes reflect the
English word?s pronunciation as well as the Chi-
nese character?s meaning (Li et al, 2007). Li

et al (2007) defined such a Chinese transliter-
ation as a phonetic-semantic transliteration (se-
mantic transliteration) to distinguish it from a
usual phonetic transliteration. One fact that
affects semantic transliteration is gender asso-
ciation (Li et al, 2007). For example, 
(meaining jasmine) is frequently used in Chi-
nese transliterations of female names but sel-
dom in common person names. Because Emily
is often used in female names, the results ob-
tained by the M(E
G
, JC
P
) and M(E
GP
, JC
P
)
models are acceptable. This indicates that Chi-
nese phonemes coupled with English graphemes
or those coupled with English graphemes and
phonemes could provide evidence required for se-
mantic transliteration as well as phonetic translit-
eration. As a result, M(E

and M(E

pled with English graphemes, achieved higher per-
formance than M(E

English graphemes.

Figure 2: Performance of each system with differ-
ent training data size
We investigated the effect of training data size
on the performance of each transliteration model.
We randomly selected training data with ratios
from 10 to 90% and compared the performance
of each system trained by different sizes of train-
ing data. The results for the basic translitera-
tion models in Figure 2(a) can be categorized into
three groups. M(E
GP
, ?) and M(E
GP
, JC
P
)
fall into the best group, where they showed the
best performance regardless of training data size.
M(E
G
, ?) and M(E
G
, JC
P
) belong to the mid-
dle group, where they showed lower performance
than the best group if the training data size is
small, but their performance is comparable to the
best group if the size of the training data is large
enough. The others always showed lower perfor-
mance than both the best and middle groups. Fig-
ure 2(b) shows that hybrid transliteration models,
on average, were less sensitive to the training data
size than the basic ones, because the two differ-
ent basic transliteration models used in the hybrid
ones boosted transliteration performance by com-
plementing each other?s weak points.
5 Conclusion
We proposed a new English-to-Chinese transliter-
ation model based on Chinese phonemes and their
corresponding English graphemes and phonemes.
We defined eighteen English-to-Chinese translit-
eration models including our proposed model and
classified them into three classes based on the role
of Chinese phonemes in the transliteration mod-
els. Experiments showed that Chinese phonemes
in our proposed model can contribute to the
performance improvement in English-to-Chinese
transliteration.
Now we can answer Yes to this paper?s key ques-
tion, ?Can Chinese phonemes improve machine
transliteration?? Actually, this is the second time
the same question has been answered. The pre-
vious answer, which was unfortunately reported
as No by Li et al (2004), has been accepted as
true for the last five years; the research issue has
been considered closed. In this paper, we found
a new answer that contradicts the previous an-
swer. We hope that our answer promotes research
on phoneme-based English-to-Chinese translitera-
tion.
