ABSTRACT 
The paper presents a morpho-lexical environ- 
ment, designed for the management of root- 
oriented natural language dictionaries. It also 
encapsulates the basic morpho-lexical processings: 
analysis and synthesis of individual word-forms or 
compounds (idioms and analytic onstructions). 
INTRODUCTION 
lately, a proliferation of computational lexicon 
environments (CLE) has been noticed, which 
sign iftcantly influence the work on natural language 
(mainly, machine translation) (Byrd et al 1987), 
(Nircnburg and Raskin 1987), (Ritchie et al 1987) 
etc. With more and more computing power incor- 
porated, the modern CLEs are capable to process 
not only individual inflected words or derivatives 
but also idioms and collocations. Nonetheless, 
there are many applications in language industry 
which consider a CLE an unfordable luxury. We 
believe that such an objection may be refused if the 
CLE is so designed that it should function in a 
data-driven manner. 
We have purposely developed a morpho-lexical 
management and processing environment aimed at 
providing an unified and satisfactory solution to a 
wide range of applications: intelligent text-process- 
ing, textual information retrieval, natural anguage 
interfacing, natural language understanding, ma- 
chine translation. Also, and more important, the 
environment is intended to be used for a large class 
of natural languages (at least for those of which 
morphology may be described in terms of our para- 
digmatic model (Tufts 1989)). 
In order to reach these objectives, we made a 
clear distinction between the morphological pro. 
cess ings and the knowledge governing them. This 
distinction Is beneficial not only with respect o 
natural language independence from the processing 
environment but also with respect o the d~ired 
degree of complexity of the process in case. The lack 
of information in such an approach will not block 
the system but will produce a simplified result. 
An interesting characteristic ofour system is its 
capability to treat, besides idioms, analytical com- 
pounds as well as grammatical nd lexical colloca- 
tions. 
The work reported here is developed within the 
context of the paradigmatic theory of morphology 
as defined in Tufts (1990). The terminology used in 
the following is taken from the above-mentioned 
paper. In the same paper, it is shown that learna- 
bility is the great advantage of paradigmatic mor- 
phology. The PARADIGM system, described in 
Tufts (1989) and Tufis (1990) allows a novice user 
to informally teach the program how to (de)com- 
pose inflexionai word-forms, that is to enable the 
morphological processing by a natural language 
processor. 
THE MORPHO-LEXICAL 
KNOWLEDGE BASE 
Obviously, the main depository of morpho-lexi- 
cal knowledge is the dictionary, to be discussed in 
the following. 
Other morphological knowledge sources are the 
endings tree and the paradigms table. These data 
structures do not depend on a specific lexical stock 
because they encode general inguistic knowledge 
for the language in ease (parts of speech, relevant 
categories for the inflexional behaviour, endings, 
paradigms, etc.). Since their organization and ac- 
quisition are described elsewhere ((Tufts 1989) and 
(Tufts 1990)) we will not dwell on them. 
THE DICT IONARY 
In our system, the dictionary is a two-way ac- 
cessible collection of hierarchically structured en- 
tries. During parsing, the access i  provided by a root 
index. Each root in this index is associated with one 
or (in case of root-homonymy) more dictionary 
entries. During generation, the access is ensured by 
a meaning index. Each symbol in this index labelling 
a meaning description structure (see below) is asso- 
ciated with one or (in case of synonymy) more dic- 
tionary entries. 
- 95  . 
The formal structure of a dictionary entry is de- 
scribed by the regular expression below: 
<entry> ::= (</emma> <part-of-speech> 
(<valency-model> <semantic-description>*)* 
(<non-regular-root> <paradigmatic-description>*)* 
( <phono-hyphen >)* 
( <syntagmatic-description >)*) 
where: 
</emma> and <part-of-speech> ave the 
usual meaning. 
<valency-model> is a list of idiosyncratic fea- 
tures of interest mainly for syntactic processing 
(syntactic patterns, required prepositions, positions 
with respect to the dominant constituent for adjec- 
tives and adverbs, etc.). 
<semantic-description > is the name of a case. 
f rame structure placed in a generic-specific hier- 
archy. The actual semantic descriptions reside in a 
different data space than the rest of the dictionary. 
This separation is motivated by various reasons, 
among them being: 
- the intention to enable for a meaning-based 
transfer, via the semantic descriptions area, 
between monolingual dictionaries; 
- the capability of interchanging domain- 
oriented semantic descriptions; 
- -  the lexical stock independence from the 
meaning representation :formalism; 
- a more precise treatment of synonymy, anto- 
nymy and generalization-specialization rela- 
tions. 
Concerning the last reasoil invoked above, it is 
quite obvious that synonymy, antonymy or generali- 
zation-specialization relations cannot be estab- 
lished directly between dictionary entries. This is 
because such relations, more often than not, are 
defined over specific meanings of a pair of words 
and rarely a word is monosemantic. On the other 
hand, such relations are frequently domain depend- 
ent. Therefore, we let them be expressed between 
semantic case-frames (descriptors of individual 
meanings), but, because the meaning repre- 
sentation of the lexical stock is beyond the purpose 
of this paper, we will not refer to it. 
<non-regular-root> and the <paradigmatic- 
description>s descr ibe-  for non-regular :inflect- 
ing words - -  the conditions under which the 
<non-regular-root> may be considered in forming 
a word-form. A formal definition of what we call 
non-regular inflecting, as opposed tO the regular 
inflecting, is given in Tufts (1989). Informally, a 
word is a regular-inflecting one iff any grammatical 
form of it may be written as <constant-part> + 
<ending>. The <constant-part> is called the 
regular root of theword. If a word is not a regular- 
inflecting one, it is called non-regular. One may 
note that a non-regular inflecting word is charac- 
terized by more than one root. These roots are 
called non-regular-roots. A <paradigmatic-de- 
scription> is a bit-map codification for the endings 
in a paradigm which may be combined, under a 
feature-values et of restrictions, with the <non- 
regular-root>. 
<phono-hyphen> is a place-holder for the pro- 
nunciation transcription of the lemma or of the 
non-regular oots.iThis field also contains informa- 
tion about the hyphenation of the corresponding 
item. 
<syntagmatic-description > is a parameterized 
pattern, describing roups of words which are to be 
recognized or generated as stand-alone processing 
units. Given the importance of what we called syn- 
tagmatic processing (probably the most attractive 
feature of our system) we shall devote the next 
section to the presentation i greater detail of this 
topic. 
THE SYNTAGMS 
We mean by syntagm a sequence of at least two 
lcxical items which are to bc processed as a single 
unit. In accordance with this definition, the colloca- 
tions, idioms and analytical compounds are syn- 
tagms. 
A syntagm is represented in the dictionary as a 
pair (<result> <pattern >) and it is associated with 
the lcmma of the entry in case. This lcmma is called 
the p ivot  e lement  of the syntagm and it may appear 
in whatever position of the sequence. 
In order to clarify the syntagm processing let us 
examine its formal structure: 
- 9 6  - 
< syntagm > ::= (<result> <pattern> <position-of-pivot-in-pattern>) 
<pattern> ::= (<element> <element> +) 
<element> ::= <word-form>\] </emma> I <category> 
I <compound-element>) 
< compound-element> :: = (< displacement> </emma > <restriction >*) 
\] (<displacement> <category> <restriction>*) 
\] <choice-list> 
< choice-list > :: = (< element > + < ob/igativity>) 
<obligativily> ::= TRUE I FALSE 
<displacement> ::= + I < \ ] - - \ ]  > 
<restriction> ::= (<feature> <value>*) 
<restriction> ) <result> ::= (<syntagm-value> " * 
<syntagm-value> ::= NULL I </emma> 
The replacement element of a syntagm is either 
the empty string or alemma which will be associated 
with the appropriate morpho-lexical features as re- 
suited from its processing. This lemma may corre- 
spond to an element in the <pattern> specially 
marked as syntagm substituter and in this case 
<syntagm-value> is NULL (the empty replace- 
ment string corresponds to the NULL value of 
<syntagm-value> and no substituter lement in 
the <pattern>). 
The <element> in the <pattern> of a <syn- 
tagm> may be a word-form, an (un)restricted 
lemma, an (un)reslrictcd grammar category or any 
one in a choice list of specified <element>s. In case 
of a choice, if <obligativity> is FALSE, besides the 
specified <element>s, the empty string is a valid 
candidate too. 
The <displacement> specified in a <com- 
pound-element> of the pattern of a <syntagm> 
determines the role to be played further on by the 
considered element. The meaning of the value in 
this field depends on whether the syntagm is to be 
recognized or generated: 
- the value '+'  specifies that he current element 
is either the replacer of the syntagm (during 
analysis), or one of the elements of the syn- 
tagm expansion, inthe specified position (dur- 
ing generation); 
- for analysis purposes, the values '<'  and '>' 
specify that the current element is an "alien" 
constituent which must be transferred in front 
of or behind the syntagm replacer, ~pective- 
ly; during generation phase, the same values 
specify that the first item from the left or from 
the right of the syntagmatic item which is to be 
expanded will be moved - -  obeying the 
possible restrictions - - to the output string, in 
the current position; 
- the '--' value is the default and says that the 
element in case will either be deleted from the 
input string (duringanalysis) or inserted in the 
output string (during eneration). 
The <restriction>s are the principal means by 
which a lexicon designer expresses the rules govern- 
ing the correct use of a syntagm. Depending on its 
format, the meaning of a <restriction > differs: 
a) (feature) 
In this case, the first (from the left to the right) 
matching value of the feature discussed has to be the 
same for all subsequent occurrences of the a-type 
restrictions over the same feature. This type of re- 
striction is used to express feature congruency for 
different constituents appearing in the <pattern> 
of a syntagm as well as the inheritance ofa feature 
value from the <pattern> to the <result> or vice- 
versa. 
b) (feature value) 
A <pattern> element restricted like that must 
match (during analysis) an input item having the 
specified value for the feature in case. In generation 
phase, it represents a word-forming parameter. If 
the restriction is associated with the <result> it 
simply represents an assignment (in case of ana- 
lysis) or an expanding parameter (in case of gener- 
ation). 
c) (feature value1 value2..., valuen) 
Such a restriction may act on each feature only once 
- 9 7  - 
in the <pattern> and once in the <result>. The 
paired multiple-valued features (one from the 
<pattern> and one from the <result>) position- 
ally specify the relations between the values of a 
feature xisting in both <pattern> and <result>. 
That is, if, during analysis, a <pattern> element 
matched an input item having for a given feature, 
say fro, one of the values pecified in its restriction, 
say the k th, then the feature fm will be assigned in 
the <result> the k th value in its associated rt~tric- 
tion. With generation, things are similar. 
In Tufts and Popescu (1990b), the flow of control 
as well as the formal power ofsyntagmatic process- 
ing are outlined by means of annotated examples of 
syntagms codifying the rules governing the com- 
pound verbal forms (including interrogative forms 
and "aliens" (adverbs, reflexive pronoun insertion) 
for English, French, Romanian, Russian and Span- 
ish. 
As an example we give below a syntagm describ- 
ing one of the possible ways of forming two negative 
analytical verbal forms (pass6-compos6 and plus- 
que-parfait) inFrench: 
((NULL (personne) (nombre) (genre) (modatite negative) 
(temps passe-compose plus-que parfait)) 
("ne " 
(~ dtre (personne) (nombre) (temps present imparfait)) 
(> ADVERBE (modalite negative)) 
(+ VERDE (temps participe-passe) (nombre) (genre)))

A more elaborated example, describing the basic 
compound tenses in English (not including the syn- 
tagms for handling adverbs insertion or negative 
and interrogative constructions) i  the following: 
(1) ((NULL (VOICE ACTIVE) (ASPECT CONTINOUS) (TENSE)) 
((~ BE (VOICE ACTIVE) (ASPECT INDEFINITE) (TENSE)) 
(+ VERB (TENSE PRESENT-PARTICIPLE))) 
1) 
(2) ((NULL (VOICE PASSIVE) (ASPECT INDEFINITE) (TENSE)) 
((~ BE (VOICE ACTIVE) (ASPECT INDEFINITE) (TENSE)) 
(+ VERB (TENSE PAST-PARTICIPLE))) 
1) 
(3) ((NULL (VOICE PASSIVE) (ASPECT CONTINOUS) 
(TENSE PRESENT PAST)) 
((-- BE (VOICE ACTIVE) (ASPECT CONTINOUS) 
(TENSE PRESENT PAST)) 
(+ VERB (TENSE PAST-PARTICIPLE))) 
1) 
(4) ((NULL (VOICE ACTIVE) (ASPECT INDEFINITE) 
(TENSE SIMPLE-FUTURE PRESENT-CONDITIONAL)) 
((~ SHALL (TENSE PRESENT PAST)) 
(+ VERB (TENSE PRESENT-INFINITIVE)))

((NULL (VOICE ACTIVE) (ASPECT INDEFINITE) 
(TENSE PRESENT-PREFECT PAST-PERFECT FUTURE-PERFECT 
PAST-CONDITIONAL PERFECT-INFINITIVE)) 
((-- HAVE (VOICE ACTIVE) (ASPECT INDEFINITE) 
(TENSE PRESENT PAST SIMPLE-FUTURE 
PRESENT-CONDITIONAL PRESENT-INFINITIVE)) 
(+ VERB (TENSE PAST-PARTICIPLE)))

THE ENDINGS TREE AND THE 
PARADIGMS TABLE 
The endings tree (a discrimination tree) is a 
knowledge source for the parsing process: Inter- 
nally, it represents all the known endings (we use 
the term 'ending' without further noticing its event- 
ual structure - -  e.g. suffix + desinence), and their 
morphological feature values. The nodes are la- 
belled with letters appearing indifferent endings. A
proper ending is represented bythe concatenation 
of the letters labelling the nodes along a certain 
path, starting from a terminal node towards the root 
of the tree (this organization is due to the retro- 
grade parsing strategy (Kotkova 1985) used in our 
system). A terminal node is not necessarilY a leaf 
node because of the possibility of including one 
ending into a longer one. Such a case is called 
intrinsic ambiguity. All terminal nodes are attached 
to the paradigmatic information specific to the en- 
dings they stand for. More often than not, an ending 
does not uniquely identify a paradigm but:a set of 
paradigms. In this case, the ending is called extrin- 
sically ambiguous. Both types of ambiguity are the- 
oretically solved by checks on the congruency 
between paradigmatic information attached to the 
respective ndings (taken from the endings tree) 
and the candidate roots (taken from their dictionary 
entries). 
The paradigms table is the data structure used 
during the word-form generation process. The para- 
digms are automatically classified uring the learn- 
ing (acquisition) phase (Tufis 1990) into an 
inheritance hierarchy. A compilation phase trans- 
forms this hierarchy into the paradigms table. The 
internally assigned code era given paradigm isused 
as the index in the paradigms table, an entry of which 
has the following structure: 
< fixed-feature-values > 
<variable-feature-values> <ending> + 
The <fixed-feature-values> field represents a list 
of morphologica! features with predetermined 
values for the paradigm in case. These feature- 
values (if any) are collected while compiling the 
paradigms hierarchy and represent the discrimina- 
tion criteria, according to which a more general 
paradigm is split into different specific paradigms. 
The <variable-feature-values > represents a list of 
(ordered) morphological features which may take 
any value out of the legal ones. An efficient numeric 
algorithm converts an arbitrary ordered set of fea- 
ture-values into a code used as a displacement 
identifying the appropriate <ending> in the cur- 
rent entry of the table. Let us mention that the 
variable features have default values, so that, even 
if the generation criteria set was not completely 
specified, an inflected word-form is still generated. 
Moreover, ifthe endings tree or the paradigms table 
are not defined, the system does not crash but in- 
stead functions as if it had been designed for a 
word-form dictionary (the trivial morphology ap- 
proach). 
FINAL REMARKS 
Due to the lack of space, we will discuss here 
neither the processing units of our environment or 
the control flows between them. The interested 
reader may find all the necessary details in Tufts and 
Popescu (1990a) and Tufts and Popescu (1990b). 
Yet, we have to say that the proper morpho-lexical 
processings (analysis and generation), were thought 
to work in a concurrent manner. For instance read- 
ing characters from the keyboard, parsing individ- 
ual word-forms, spelling checking and parsing 
syntagms are usually simultaneously active pro- 
ceases; similarly, individual word-forms generation 
and syntagms expansion are typical coroutines. 
It is worth mentioning that, by default, the result 
of parsing as provided by our system is not a linear 
sequence of unique lexical items. The result in- 
cludes all valid interpretations of every word in the 
input (including unknown words) thus generating 
lexically ambiguous  dements ,  as well as all legal 
groupings of syntagmatic components hus genera- 
- 99  - 
ting iexically ambiguous structures. 
If such a complete analysis is not desirable, a set 
of general-purpose h uristics may be used to filter 
the parsing (for instance when a word may be seg- 
mented in different ways, taking into account only 
the roots corresponding to the longest endings, con- 
sidering the syntagms with the maximum number of 
constituents, etc., see Tufts (1990)). 
With respect to spelling errors recovery, we dis- 
tinguish between typing and linguistic anomalies. 
The typing errors are the usual misspellings taken 
into account by the spelling checkers of text editors. 
Anyway, there is an important difference: because 
(normally) our dictionaries are root-oriented, the 
standard spelling checking refers to the roots. With 
the endings, due to the limited number and limited 
length and thanks to the discriminating organiza- 
tion of the endings tree, the recovery ismuch more 
precise (the recovery is always complete when the 
root was found in the dictionary). 
The case when the morphological features of the 
root of a word-form are not completely congruent 
with the morphological features of its recognized 
ending is considered a linguistic error. The con- 
gruency checking allows for an easy recovery of such 
mistakes. The distinct reatment ofthis type of error 
is very useful in case of CAI systems for language 
learning (Zock et al 1990) and we intend, in the 
near future, to provide an explanation module to 
the congruency hecker for such applications. 
The generation process is bound to the morpho- 
logical evel, i.e. the lexical items are produced by a 
higher level module in the order they are supposed 
to appear in the output natural language string. 
An exception from this rule is given by syntag- 
matic symbols generation. As previously shown, the 
pattern of a syntagm may specify one or more 
"alien" constituents ( uch as adverbs or pronouns). 
While expanding such a pattern, a '<' or '>' - 
marked constituent is imported into the syntag- 
matic sequence from the left or from the right of the 
syntagmatic symbol, thus changing the initial orde- 
ring. 
TheMORPHIS system, described in this paper is 
partially implemented in GOLDEN COMMON- 
LISP for IBM PC-AT compatible personal compu- 
ters. 
At present, auser-friendly interface isunder de- 
velopment, whicll is supposed to decrease as much 
as possible the level of expertise required to a user 
in order to build his/her own morphological knowl- 
edge base. 
The interface will also include on-line consulting 
facilities and the system will be equipped with con- 
figuration possibilities and standard linking inter- 
faces for three main types of applications: advanced 
text-editing, language-learning and machine trans- 
lation (including NL interfaces).
