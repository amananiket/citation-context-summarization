Abstract 
We present a method for individuating dependencies between the semantic lass of 
predicates and their associated subcategorization frames, and describe an implemen- 
tation which allows the acquisition of such dependencies from bracketed texts. 
1 Introduction 
There is a widespread belief among linguists that a predicate's subcategorization frames 
are largely determined by its lexical-semantic properties \[23, 11, 12\]. Consider the do- 
main of movement verbs. Following Talmy \[23\], these can he semantically classified with 
reference to the meaning components: MOTION, MANNER, CAUSATION, THEME (MOVING 
ENTITY), PATH AND REFERENCE LOCATIONS (GOAL, SOURCE). Lexicalization patterns 
which arise from identifying clusters of such meaning components in verb senses can be 
systematically related to distinct subcategorization frames. 1 For example, the arguments 
of a verb expressing directed caused motion (e.g. bring, put, give) are normally a causative 
subject (agent), a theme direct object (moving entity) and a directional argument express- 
ing path and reference location (goal), e.g. 
(1) Jackie will bring a bottle of retsina to the party 
CAUSER THEME PATH GOAL 
However, a motion verb which is not amenable to direct external causation \[13\], will 
typically take a theme subject, with the possible addition of a directional argument, e.g. 
(2) The baby crawled (across the room) 
Co-occurrence r strictions between meaning components may also preempt subcategoriza- 
tion options; for example, manner of motion verbs in Italian cannot integrate a completed 
path component and therefore never subcategorize for a directional argument, e.g. 
(3)*Carlo ha camminato a casa 
Carlo walked home 
1Following Levin \[12\] and Sanfilippo \[18\], we maintain that valency reduction processes (e.g. the 
causative-inchoative alternation) are semantically governed and thus do not weaken the correlation be- 
tween verb semantics and subcategorization properties. 
82 
These generalizations are important for NLP since they frequently cover large sub- 
classes of lexical items and can be used both to reduce redundancy and elucidate sig- 
nificant aspects of lexical structure. Moreover, a precise characterization of the relation 
between semantic subclasses and subcategorization properties of verbs can aid lexical dis- 
ambiguation. For example, the verb accord can be used in either one of two senses: agree 
or give, e,g. 
(4) a The two alibis do not accord 
Your alibi does not accord with his 
b They accorded him a warm welcome 
Accord is intransitive in the agree senses hown in (4a), and ditransitive in the give sense 
shown in (4b). 
The manual encoding of subcategorization ptions for each choice of verb subclass in 
the language is very costly to develop and maintain. This problem can be alleviated by 
automatically extracting collocational information, e.g. grammar codes, from Machine 
Readable Dictionaries (MRDs). However, most of these dictionaries are not intended for 
such processing; their readership rarely require or desire such exhaustive and exacting 
precision. More specifically, the information available is in most cases compiled manually 
according to the lexicographer's intuitions rather than (semi-)automatically derived from 
texts recording actual language use. As a source of lexical information for NLP, MRDs 
are therefore liable to suffer from omissions, inconsistencies and occasional errors as well 
as being unable to cope with evolving usage \[1, 4, 2, 6\]. Ultimately, the maintenance 
costs involved in redressing such inadequacies are likely to reduce the initial appeal of 
generating subcategorization lists from MRDs. 
In keeping with these observations, we implemented a suite of programs which provide 
an integrated approach to lexical knowledge acquisition. The programs elicit dependen- 
cies between semantic verb classes and their admissible subcategorization frames using 
machine readable thesauri to assist in semantic tagging of texts. 
2 Background 
Currently available dictionaries do not provide a sufficiently reliable source of lexical 
knowlege for NLP systems. This has led an increasing number of researchers to look 
at text corpora as a source of information \[8, 22, 9, 6, 3\]. For example, Brent \[6\] de- 
scribes a program which retrieves ubcategorization frames from untagged text. Brent's 
approach relies on detecting nominal, clausal and infinitive complements after identifi- 
cation of proper nouns and pronouns using predictions based on GB's Case Filter \[16\] 
- -  e.g. in English, a noun phrase occurs to the immediate left of a tensed verb, or the 
immediate right of a main verb or preposition. Brent's results are impressive considering 
that no text preprocessing (e.g. tagging or bracketing) is assumed. However, the number 
of subeategorization ptions recognized is minimal, 2 and it is hard to imagine how the 
approach could be extended to cover the full range of subcategorization possibilities with- 
out introducing some form of text preprocessing. Also, the phrasal patterns extracted are 
too impoverished to infer selectional restrictions as they only contain proper nouns and 
pronouns. 
2Brent's program recognizes five suhcategorization frames built out of three kinds of constituents: 
noun phrase, clause, infinitive. 
83 
Lexical acquisition of collocational information from preprocessed text is now becom- 
ing more popular as tools for analyzing corpora are getting to be more reliable \[9\]. For 
example, Basili el al. \[3\] present a method for acquiring sublanguage-specific selectional 
restrictions from corpora which uses text processing techniques uch as morphological 
tagging and shallow syntactic analysis. Their approach relies on extracting word pairs 
and triples which represent crucial environments for the acquisition of selectional re- 
strictions (e.g. V_prep_N(go, to, Boston)). They then replace words with semantic tags 
(V_prep_N(PHYSICAL_ACT-to-PLACE)) and compute co-occurrence preferences among 
them. Semantic tags are crucial for making generalizations about the types of words which 
can appear in a given context (e.g. as the argument of a verb or preposition). However, 
Basili et al rely on manual encoding in the assignment of semantic tags; such a practice 
is bound to become more costly as the text under consideration grows in size and may 
prove prohibitively expensive with very large corpora. Furthermore, the semantic tags 
are allowed to vary from domain to domain (e.g. commercial nd legal corpora) and are 
not hierarchically structured. With no consequent notion of subsumption, it might be 
impossible to identify "families" of tags relating to germane concepts across sublanguages 
(e.g. PHYSICAL_ACT, ACT; BUILDING, REAL_ESTATES). 
3 CorPSE: a Body of Programs for Acquiring Se- 
mantically Tagged Subcategorization Frames from 
Bracketed Texts 
In developing CorPSE (Corpus-based Predicate Structure Extractor) we followed Basili 
et al's idea of extracting semantically tagged phrasal frames from preprocessed text, 
but we used the Longman Lexicon of Contemporary English (LLOCE \[15\]) to automate 
semantic tagging. LLOCE entries are similar to those of learner's dictionaries, but are 
arranged in a thesaurus-like fashion using semantic odes which provide a linguistically- 
motivated classification of words. For example, \[19\] show that the semantic odes of 
LLOCE are instrumental in identifying members of the six subclasses of psychological 
predicates described in (5) \[12, 11\]. 
(5) 
I Affect type Experiencer Subject Stimulus Subject I 
NeutrM experience interest 
Positive admire fascinate 
Negative fear scare 
As shown in (6), each verb representing a subclass has a code which often provides a 
uniform characterization f the subclass. 
(6) 
C o ~  Group Header Entries H 
Relating to feeling 
Admiring and honouring 
Fear and Dread 
Attracting and interesting 
Attracting and interesting very much 
Frighten and panic 
feel, sense, experience... 
admire, respect, look up to .. .  
fear, fear for, be frightened ... 
attract, interest, concern... 
fascinate, enthrall, enchant.. .  
frighten, scare, terrify.. .  
84 
Moreover, LLOCE codes are conveniently arranged into a 3-tier hierarchy according 
to specificity, e.g. 
F Feelings, Emotions, Attitudes and Sensations 
F20-F40 Liking and not Liking 
F26 Attracting and Interesting very much 
fascinate, enthrall, enchant, charm, captivate 
The bottom layer of the hierarchy contains over 1500 domain-specific tags, the middle 
layer has 129 tags and the top (most general) layer has 14. Domain-specific tags are 
always linked to intermediate tags which are, in turn, linked to general tags. Thus we 
can tag sublanguages u ing domain-specific semantic odes (as do Basili et ai.) without 
generating unrelated sets of such codes. 
We assigned semantic tags to Subcategorizatio, Frame tokens (SF tokens) extracted 
from the Penn Treebank \[14, 20, 21\] to produce Subcategorization Frame types (SF types). 
Each SF type consists of a verb stem associated with one or more semantic tags, and a 
list of its (non-subject) complements, if any. The head of noun phrase complements were 
also semantically tagged. We used LLOCE collocational information - -  grammar codes 
- -  to reduce or remove semantic ambiguity arising from multiple assignment of tags to 
verb and noun stems. The structures below exemplify these three stages. 
SF token: ((DENY VB) 
(NP (ALIENS NNS)) 
(NP (*COMPOUND-NOUN* (STATE NN) (BENEFITS NNS)))) 
SF type: (("deny" ("C193"-refuse "G127"-reject)) 
((*NP* ("C"-people_and_family)) 
(*NP* ("N"-general_and_abstract_terms)))) 
Disambiguated SF type: (("deny" ("C193")) 
((,NP, ("c")) 
(,NP, ( " r ) ) ) )  
3.1 CorPSE's  General  Funct ional i ty 
CorPSE is conceptually segmented into 2 parts: a predicate structure extractor, and a 
semantic processor. The predicate structure extractor takes bracketed text as input, 
and outputs SF tokens. The semantic processor converts SF tokens into SF types and 
disambiguates them. 
3.1.1 Ext rac t ing  SF Tokens 
The predicate structure xtractor elicits SF tokens from a bracketed input corpus. These 
tokens are formed from phrasal fragments which correspond to a subcategorization frame, 
factoring out the most relevant information. In the case of verbs, such fragments corre- 
spond to verb phrases where the following simplificatory changes have been applied: 
? NP complements have been reduced to the head noun (or head nouns in the case of 
coordinated NP's or nominal compounds), e.g. ((FACES VBZ) (NP (CHARGES NNS))) 
85 
? PP complements have been reduced to the head preposition plus the head of the 
complement oun phrase, e.g. ((RIDES VBZ) (PP IN ((VAIl Nil)))) 
* VP complements are reduced to a mention of the VFORM of the head verb, e.g. 
((TRY VB) (VP TO)) 
? clausal complements are reduced to a mention of the complementizer which intro- 
duces them, e.g. ((ARGUED VBD) (SBAR THAT)) 
An important step in the extraction of SF tokens is to distinguish passive and active 
verb phrases. Passives are discriminated by locating a past participle following an auxiliary 
be. 
3.1.2 Converting SF Tokens into SF Types 
The semantic processor operates on the output of the predicate structure xtractor. In- 
flected words in input SF tokens are first passed through a general purpose morphological 
analyser \[17\] and reduced to bare stems suitable for automated ictionary and lexicon 
searches. The next phase is to supplement SF tokens with semantic tags from LLOCE us- 
ing the facilities of the ACQUILEX LDB \[5, 7\] and DCK \[17\]; LLOCE tags are associated 
with verb stems and simply replace noun stems. 
The resulting SF structures are finally converted into SF types according to the rep- 
resentation system whose syntax is sketched in (7) where: stem is the verb stem, parts a 
possil)ly empty sequence of particles associated with the verb stem, {A .. .  N } is the set of 
LLOCE semantic odes, pforrn thehead of a prepositional phrase, compform the possibly 
empty complementizer of a clausal complement, and cat any category not covered by np-, 
pp-, sbar- and vp- frames. 
(7) SF-type ::= 
sem ::= 
comps : := 
comp ::= 
np-frame ::= 
pp-frame ::= 
sbar-frame ::= 
vp-frame ::= 
cat-frame ::= 
( stem parts sem comps ) 
({A . . .N  }*)  
comp* 
( { np-frame I pp-frame \] sbar-frame I vp-frame I cat-frame } ) 
( *NP*  sem ) 
( *PP*  pform comp ) 
( *SBAI t *  compform ) 
( *VP*  vform ) 
( *CAT*  cat ) 
3.1.3 D isambiguat ing  SF Types  
The disambiguation module of the semantic processor coalesces SF types, and reduces 
semantic tags when verb stems have several codes. 
Coalescing merges SF types with isomorphic structure and identical verb stem, com- 
bining the semantic odes of NP-frames, e.g. 
86 
(("accord" ("D101 . . . .  N226" )  ) 
((*PP* TO (*NP* ("C"))))) 
( ( "accord"  ("D101 . . . .  N226")) =~ ( ( "accord"  ("D101 . . . .  N226")) 
((*ee* TO (*NP* ("G"))))) ((*PP* TO (*liP* ("C .... G"))))) 
(("accord" ("D101 . . . .  N226" ) )  
((*PP* TO (*NP* ("C .... G"))))) 
This process can be performed in linear time when the input is lexicographically sorted. 
We employ two tag reduction methods. The first eliminates equivalent tags, the second 
applies syntactico-semantic restrictions using LLOCE grammar codes. 
More than one LLOCE code can apply to a particular entry. Under these circum- 
stances, it may be possible to ignore one or more of them. For example, the verb function 
is assigned two distinct codes in LLOCE: 128 functioning and serving, and N123 func- 
tioning and performing. Although I- and N:codes may in principle differ considerably, in 
this case they are very similar; indeed, the entries for the two codes are identical. This 
identity can be automatically inferred from the descriptor associated with semantic odes 
in the LLOCE index. For example, for a verb such as accord where each semantic ode is 
related to a distinct entry, the index gives two separate descriptors: 
accord . . .  
give v D101 
agree v N226 
By contrast, different codes related to the same entry are associated with the same de- 
scriptor, as shown for the entry function below. 
funct ion  . . .  
work v I28, N123 
We exploit the correlation between descriptors and semantic odes in the LLOCI'; index, 
reducing multiple codes indexed by the same descriptor to just one. More precisely, tile 
reduction involves ubstitution of all codes having equal descriptors with a new code which 
represents the logical conjunction of the substituted codes. This is shown in (8) where 
"I28+N123" is defined as the intersection of "128" and "N123" in the LLOCE hierarchy 
of semantics codes as indicated in (9). 
(("function" ("I28 .... N123")) (("function" ("I28+N123")) 
(8) ((*PP* LIKE (*NP* ( "C" ) ) ) ) )  ~ ((*PP* LIKE (*NP* ( "C" ) ) ) ) )  
(9) 
T 
I N ???  
? .. I28 N123 "-" 
I 28+N123 
87 
The second means for disambiguating SF types consists of filtering out the codes of 
verb stems which are incompatible with the type of subcategorization frame in which they 
occur. This is done by using collocational information provided in LLOCE. For example, 
the verb deny is assigned two distinct semantic odes which cannot be reduced to one as 
they have different descriptors: 
deny ... 
refuse v C193 
reject v G127 
The difference in semantic ode entails distinct subcategorization ptions: deny can have 
a ditransitive subcategorization frame only in the refuse sense, e.g. 
(10) Republican senator David Lock's bill would permanently { deny (refuse) illegal *deny (reject) J 
aliens all State benefits 
The codependency between semantic verb class and subcategorization can often be in- 
ferred by the grammar code of LLOCE entries. For example, only the entry for the 
refuse sense of deny in LLOCE includes the grammar code D1 which signals a ditransitive 
subcategorization frame: 
( l l )  C193 verbs: not lett ing or al lowing 
deny \[D1;T1\] ... 
G127 verbs: re jec t ing . . .  
deny 1 \[T1,4,5;V3\] . . .2  IT1\] ... 
Semantic odes which are incompatible with the SF types in which they occur, such as 
G127 in (12), can thus be filtered out by enforcing constraints between SF type comple- 
ment structures and LLOCE grammar codes. 
(12) ( ("deny" ("C193 .... G127")) 
((*NP* ("C")) 
(,~e, ("~")))) 
To automate this process, we first form a set GC of compatible grammar codes for each 
choice of complement s ructure in SF types. For example, the set of compatible grammar 
codes GC for any SF type with two noun phrase complements is restricted to the singleton 
set {D1}, e.g. 
(13) ( (slera sere) ~ GC = {D1} 
((*NP* sere  ) 
(*NP* sem ) ) ) 
A set of 2-tuples of the form (verb-stem-semantic-code, grammar-codes) i  formed by 
noting the LLOCE grammar codes for each semantic ode that could apply to the verb 
stem. If the grammar codes of any 2-tuple have no intersection with the grammatical 
restrictions GC, we conclude that the associated verb-stem-semantic code is not possible. 3 
For example, C193 in the SF type for deny in (13) is paired up with the grammar codes 
{D1;T1} and G127 with (T1,4,5;V3} according to the LLOCE entries for deny shown in 
3This procedure is only effective if the corpus ubcategorization information is equally or more precise 
than the dictionary information. For our corpus, it proved to be the case. 
88 
(12). The constraints in (14) would thus license automatic removal of semantic ode G 127 
from the SF type for ditransitive deny as shown in (15). 
(14) (("deny" ((C193, {D1, T1}) ~ GC = {D1} 
(G127, {T1, T4, T5, V3})) ) 
((*NP* ("C")) 
(,NP, ( " r ) ) ) )  
(15) (("deny" ("C193"-refuse "G127"- re ject ) )  ~ (("deny" ("C193")) 
((*NP* ( "c" ) )  ( ( .Np.  ( "c" ) )  
(,NP, ( 'T ' ) ) ) )  (*NP* ( " r ) ) ) )  
It may appear that there is a certain circularity in our work. We use grammar codes 
to help disambiguate SF types, but it might be argued that the corpus could not have 
been bracketed without some prior grammatical information: subcategorisation frames. 
This picture is inaccurate because our SF types provide collocational information which is 
not in LLOCE. For example, the SF type shown in (16a) captures the use of link in (16b); 
this subcategorization cannot be inferred from the LLOCE entry where no PP headed by 
to is mentioned. 
(16) a ( ( " l ink"  NIL ("N")) 
((*NP, ("c")) 
(*PP* TO (*NP* ("B . . . .  N"))))) 
b The arrest warrant issued in Florida \]inks the attorney to a government probe 
of the Medhyin drug cartel ...  
Indeed, another possible use for our system would be to provide feedback to an on-line 
dictionary. We also provide a partial indication of selectional restrictions, i.e. the se- 
mantic tags of NP complements. Furthermore, text can be bracketed using techniques 
such as stochastic and semi-automatic parsing which need not rely on exhaustive lists of 
subcategorisations. 
4 Using CorPSE: Emerging Trends and Current Lim- 
itations 
In testing CorPSE, our main objectives were: 
? to assess the functionality of text pre-processing techniques involving automated 
semantic tagging and lexical disambiguation, and 
? to show that such techniques may yield profitable results in capturing regularities 
in the syntax-semantics nterface 
In order to do this, we ran CorPSE on a section of the Penn Treebank comprising 576 
bracketed sentences from radio transcripts. /,From these sentences, CorPSE extracted 1335 
SF tokens comprising 1245 active VPs and 90 passives. The SF tokens were converted 
into 817 SF types. The coalescence process reduced the 817 SF types to 583, which are 
representative of 346 distinct verb stems. The verb stern of 308 of these 583 SF types was 
semantically ambiguous as it was associated with more than one semantic tag. In some 
89 
cases, this ambiguity was appropriate because the semantic odes assigned to the stem 
were all compatible with the complement s ructure of their SF type. For example, the 
verb call can occur in either one of two senses, summon and phone, with no change in 
subcategorization structure: 
(17) a Supper is ready, call the kids 
b Call me when you land in Paris 
In this case, CorPSE correctly maintains the ambiguity as shown in (18). 
(18) (("call" ("G"-s-,mon "M"-phone)) 
( ( ,NP ,  ( "c  . . . .  J . . . .  r ) ) ) )  
In other cases, the ambiguity was in need of resolution as some of the verb-stem's semantic 
codes referred to the same LLOCE entry or were incompatible with the complement 
structure in the SF type (see ?3.1.3). Disambiguation using semantic tag equivalence 
reduced the ambiguity of 206 types, totally disambiguating 31stems. Applying collocation 
restrictions further reduced 38 stems, totally disambiguating 24of them. 
Taking into account hat the amount of data processed was too small to use statistical 
techniques for disambiguation, the results achieved are very promising: we managed to 
reduce ambiguity in over half the SF types and totally disambiguated 16 percent, thus 
providing a unique correspondence b tween semantic verb class and subcategorization 
frame in 346 cases. Of the remaining 179 SF frames, 106 had verb stems with two 
semantic odes, 72 had verb stems with 3-5 semantic odes and the verb stem of one SF 
type had 6. Needless to say, the number of ambiguous SF types is bound to increase 
as more texts are processed. However, as we accumulate more data, we will be able to 
apply statistical techniques to reduce \]exical ambiguity, e.g. by computing co-occurrence 
restrictions between the semantic odes of the verb stem and complement heads in SF 
types. 
The table below summarizes some of the results concerning the correlation of semantic 
codes and subcategorization ptions obtained by running CorPse on the Penn Treebank 
fragment. The first column lists the LLOCE semantic odes which are explained in (20). 
The second column indicates the number of unique subcategorization ccurrences for 
each code. A major difficulty in computing this relation was the presence of certain con- 
stituents as arguments that are usually thought of as adjuncts. For example, purpose 
clauses and time adverbials uch as yesterday, all day, in March, on Friday had often 
been bracketed as arguments (i.e. sisters to a V node). Our solution was to filter out 
inadequately parsed arguments semi-automatically. Certain constituents were automati- 
cally filtered from SF types as their status as adjuncts was manifest, e.g. complements 
introduced by prepositions and complementizers such as without, as, since and because. 
Other suspect constituents, uch as infinitive VPs which could represent purpose clauses, 
were processed by direct query. A second problem was the residual ambiguities in SF 
types mentioned above. These biased the significance of occurrences since one or more 
codes in an ambiguous SF type could be inconsistent with the subcategorization f the 
SF type. A measure of the "noise" factor introduced by ambiguous SF types is given in 
the third column of (19), where ambiguity rate is computed by dividing the number of 
codes associated with the same complement s ructure by the number of occurrences of 
that code with any complement s ructure. This ambiguity measure allows the significance 
of the figures in the second column to be assessed. For example, since the occurrences of 
"E" instances were invariably ambiguous, it is difficult to draw reliable conclusions about 
90 
them. Indeed, on referring most of these SF types (e.g. beat, bolt and have) back to their 
source texts, the "Food & Drink" connotation proved incorrect. The figuresin column 1 
were normalised as percentages of the total number of occurrences in order to provide a 
measure of the statistical significance of the results in the remaining columns. We thus 
conclude that the results for B, E, H, and I are unlikely to be significant as they occur 
with low relative frequency and are highly ambiguous. The final three columns quantify 
the relative frequency of occurrence for VP, SBAR and PP complements in SF types for 
each semantic ode.

Although the results are not clear-cut, there are some emerging trends worth considering. 
For example, the low frequency of VP and SBAR complements with code "M" reflects 
the relatively rare incidence of clausal arguments ill the semantics of motion and location 
verbs. By contrast, the relatively high frequency of PP complements with this code can be 
related to the semantic propensity of motion and location verbs to take spatial arguments. 
91 
The "A" verbs (eg. create, live and murder) appear to be strongly biased towards taking 
a direct object complement only. This might be due to the fact that these verbs involve 
creating, destroying or manipulating life rather than events. Finally, the overwhelmingly 
high frequency of SBAR complements with "G" verbs is related to the fact that thought 
and communication verbs typically involve individuals and states of affairs. 
We also found interesting results concerning the distribution of subcategorization p- 
tions among specializations of the same general code. For example, 23 out of 130 occur- 
rences of "M" verbs exhibited an "NP PP" complement s ructure; 17 of these were found 
in SF types with codes "M50-M65" which largely characterize verbs of caused directed 
motion: Putting and Taking, Pulling ~4 Pushing. This trend confirms ome of the obser- 
vations discussed in the introduction. It is now premature to report results of this kind 
more fully since the corpus data used was too small and genre-specific to make more re- 
liable and detailed inferences about the relation between subcategorization a d semantic 
verb subclass. We hope that further work with larger corpora will uncover new patterns 
and corroborate current correlations which at present can only be regarded as providing 
suggestive evidence. Other than using substantially arger texts, improvements could also 
be obtained by enriching SF types, e.g. by adding information about subject constituents. 
5 Conclusions 
We have provided the building blocks for a system that combines the advantages of free- 
text processing of corpora with the more organised information found in MRDs, such as 
semantic tags and collocational information. We have shown how such a system can be 
used to acquire lexical knowledge in the form of semantically tagged subcategorization 
frames. These results can assist the automatic onstruction of lexicons for NLP, semantic 
tagging for data retrieval from textual databases as well as to help maintain, refine and 
augment MRDs.
