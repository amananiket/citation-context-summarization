A SNePS semant ic  network  (Fig. 3) is p r imar i ly  a proposi-

tional network  (see below),  it can. however ,  als,) he used to 
represent he mher t tabthtv  of propert ies,  e~ther hv expl ic it  rules or 
by path-based inference (Shapi ro  lq781. It ctins~stx of labeled 
nodes and labeled, directed arcs sat l~fwng (inter alia) the fo lh )wmg 
condi t ion (of. Malda and Shapi ro  lq82):  
iS) There is a I-I ~orrespondence betv, een nodes and represented 
concepts.  
A concept is "anyth ing  about  whtch mlormat~on can he stored 
and/or  t ransmi t ted"  (Shapiro  197q: 179). Widen a semant ic  net- 
work  such as SNePS ~s u~d to model "the behel s t ructure  ol a 
th ink ing ,  rea.~onlnt.,, language using be,ng" (Matda and Shaptru 
1982: 296: of. ~';haplro 1971h: 51.),;. the ct)nt.epts are the oh)ectx of 
menta l  (i.e.. mtentu)na l )  acts ..u~.h as th ink ing ,  behev:ng,  w ish ing ,  
etc. Such oblect,~ are mren~mal  i~.t. Rapaport  l()7g). 
It t'ollov,'s I rc,m (%) that  the arcs do not represent concepr-s. 
Rather.  they repre',ent binary, s t ructura l  re lat ions between con- 
cept.s. If ~t )s des)red to talk about certa in relat ions between con- 
cepts, then tho~e relat ions must  be represented by nodes, smce they  
have  r.neJt become objects o= thought ,  =.~, concepts.  In te rms of 
Oume's  d ic tum that  "t~ be is to be the value of  a \ [hound\]  var iab le"  
(Qume 1980: 15; cf.  Shapi ro  1971a: 7q-80). nodes represent such 
values,  ar~s do not. That  Is. g iven a domain  of d l scours~- -mc lud lng  
~tems, .'~ arv  relat ions among them,  and prolX)S~tions--SNeP% nodes 
~,ouid be used to represent all members  t)l the domain .  The arcs 
are used to s t ructure  the items, relations, and p)(,I')()'~tJons ,)l the 
domain  into ((:chef.) prl)p(~sltmns. As ~n ana logy ,  SNel)% arcs are to 
%Nel). ~, nodes as the svmn()ls '~" and "+' are to the symbols  %', '5.P'. 
ond "VI )' in the rewr i te  rule: S -, ";I ) + VI ). It ~s because m) prorxts~ 
t~ons :are represented hv arcs that  SNel)% ts a "pr()rx)sltlonal" seman-  
tic network  (c:. Maida and Shapiro 1982: 292). 
When a ~mant tc  network  such as SNePS is u~d to model a 
mind ,  the nodes represent on ly  intensional  ~tems (Maida and 
Shapi ro  1982; of. Rapaport  1978). Simil-',rly, if such a network 
were  to be used ~s a notat ion for  a fu l l y  lntensional  natura l -  
language semant ics  (such as the semant ics  presented in Rapapor t  
198-1 ), the n(~es would  represent on ly  mtens iona l  items. Thus ,  a 
semant ics  for  such a network  ought  )tsetf to be fu l l y  mtens iona l .  
There  are two pairs of  t3tpes of  nodes in S.Nel)S: constant  and  
var iab le  nixies, and atomic  (or ind iv idua l )  and  molecu lar  (or propo- 
s i tumal )  nodes. (Mo lecu lar  md~wdua l  nodes are cur rent ly  being 
implemented:  see Sect. 7. 8. For a dt~usstt)n ol tile semant ics  of  
varmble  nodes, see ShaDro  1985.) Except for  a few pre-de)ined arcs 
for  u~ by an inference package,  all arc labels are ~hosen by the 
user: such labels , re  complete ly  a rb i t ra ry  (albeit  o f ten mnemonic )  
and  depend ,m the domain  being represented. The "mean ings"  of  
the labels are provided (hv the u~rt  on ly  by means  of  expl ic i t  ru le

4. MEINONG'S TIIEORY OF OKJEC'TS. 
A!cx lus  Metnong's  (19(M) theory of  the oh)e~ts of psvchologl -  
~i  acts ~s a more appropriate foundation for a semantics of proposi- 
tional semantic networks as wel l  a.s for a natural-language seman- 
tics. in brier, 5,1emong's the()rv camsists of  the f~)llo~ing theses (c|'. 
Rapap) r t  1976, 1978): 
(M I )  Thes/s oj" Intentionality: l ivery mental act (e.g., thmkmg,  
bel ieving, judg ing,  etc.) is "d i rected" towards  an "ob.)ect". 
l 'here  are two kmds  of  Memongian objects: ( I )  objecta, the 
ind iv idua l - l i ke  oh}ectx of  such a menta l  act as thmking-o f ,  and  (2) 
44 
objectives, the propostt lon-hke objects tat such mental  acts as 
be l iev lng( - that)  or knowing( - that) .  E.g.. the object of my act of 
th ink ing  of a unicorn is: a unicorn; the object or mv act of believ- 
ing that  the I~r th  is flat is: the Earth is flat. 
(M2) Not every object of thought  exists ( technical ly ,  "has being"). 
(M3) It is not sel f -contradictory to deny. nor tautologous to al'firm. 
existence of an object of thought. 
(M4) Thesis o f  Au~sersein: Al l  objects of thought  are ausser- 
se/~nd ("beyond being and non-being"). 
For present pur~ Aussersein ts most easi ly explicated as a 
domain of quant i f icat ion for non-existent ia l ly- loaded quanttfiers. 
required by (M2) and (M3). 
(MS) I!verv oblect of thought  has properties ( technical ly .  "Sosein"). 
(M6) Principle o f  Independence: (M2) and (MS) are not incon- 
sistent. ( For more d,~'ux, c on. i f .  Rapal~rt  I984c.) 
('atoll'dry: l iven oblectx of thought  that do not exist have 
properties. 
(M7) Principle o f  l"teedom o f  Assumption : 
(a) I!verv set ol properties (S, asein) ci~rres(~mds ti~ ,in ~hlect 
~fl" thought.  
(b) l ivery oblet:t t~l thought can be thought ol (retatl ' .e to 
certain "perfornlance'" IlnlltiltlonsL 
(x,18) ~me objects of Ihought are ,ncomplete (i.e.. undeternl lned 
with respect (a ,~lme prtIpertleSL 
(Mg)  The meaning tal every  ~ntence ;anti noun phrase Is an -hi~ct 
~I thought. 
It should be obvious that there is a close relat ionship between 
Memong's theory and a ru l lv  mtensnonat ~mant lc  network  hke 
%NePS. SNel)S it.'.,elf ts much hke .4usse~ein; %haplro (personal 
communicat ion)  has said that all  nixies are :mpIncntlv m the net- 
work ,ill the ume. In part icular,  a SNePS base (i.e.. attempt constant)  
n(xJe represents an ohlectum, and a %NePS pr(q'x~ltn(mal nixie 
represents :in ,~hlt~tnve. Thus. when %NeP% ,s used as a mtx.lel ~,1 ,~ 
mind. pr(q'xxstttonal taxies represent the able, t i res ol  behels (d .  
Matda and ~hapnro 1982. Rapal'~rt and ~,hapiro 1984. Raparxwt 
!984b;; and When S \ - l  )':, t,? used xn a natural  language pr(x:e~.,~ing 
system tcf. Shaptn) 1982. Rapal~)rt and %hapirn 1984). Lndivtdual 
nixies represent he meanmgs ill' noun phra~s  and verb phrases, and 
pr(arx~slttonal taxies represent he meannng'~ (af sentences. 
Memong's theory wa.s attacked by l lertrand Ru~setl tan 
gr, aunds of inconsistency: (1) According t(a Meinong, :he round 
square is boil: round and square (mdeed. this ,s a tautology);  vet. 
according to Rus~l l .  ~i" ~t is r(aund, then ~t ~s not square. (2) %lm~- 
larlv, the extsung .~{)lden mounuHn must ha ;e  .ill three of its 
definmg prtaperttes: benng a m(,untam, h~mv ~,,lden. and existing; 
but. as Russell re)ted. I: doest(t exu'~t. I( ' l .  Rapapt~rt 1976. 1978 It)r 
rel erences.) 
There have bee.n several I . rmahzatnons ,fl Melnonglan 
theories in recent philosophical l i terature, each of which  overcomes 
these problems. In ~ul~,,quent ce~tnon.~ I briefly de.~rxbe three of 
these and show their  re latmnshir~ to SNePS. (Others, not described 
}'.ere. include Routlev 1979----cf. Raparx~rt lqg4a- -and  Zalta 1983.) 
5. RAPAPOIIT'S THEORY. 
On my own reconstruction of Meinong's theory (Rapaport 
1976, 1978- -wh ich  bears a coincidental r~mblance  to McCarthy 
1979). there are two  types of  objecLs: M-objecta (i.e~ the objects of 
thought,  wh ich  are intensional)  and actual objects (wh ich  are 
extensional) .  There are two  modes of predication of properties to 
these: M-objects are constituted by properties, and both M- and 
actual  objects can exempl i fy  properties. For instance, the pen w i th  
wh ich  l wrote  the manumnpt  of this paper is an actual object that 
exemplif ies the property of  being while. Right now.  when I th ink  
about that  pen. the object of my thought  is an M-oblect that is con- 
stitLaed ( in part)  by that property. The M-object Jan's pen can be 
represented as: <belonging to Jan. being a pen> (or. for short, as: 
* J .  P>) .  Ileing a pen is also a constituent of this M-object: P c 
<J. P >; and 'Jan% pen is a pen' is true in v i r tue  of this objective. 
\[n addit ion.  < J .  P > exemplifies (ex) the property of being consti- 
tuzed by two properties. There might  be an actual (abject, .say. ~. 
corresrxmding to <J .  P >, that exemplifies the property of being a 
pen (iv ex /" ) as wel l  as (say) the property of being 6 inches &rag. 
But being 6 inches long ? ('J. l" ",. 
"\['he M-object the round square. ? R. A' ",. IS c,nstntuted bv pre- 
cn~ly two  properties: being round ( R ) and being ~uare  (S): "The 
round square is round' is true m vir tue of this. and 'The round 
~uare  ts not .~luare" ts fa l~  ,n v i r tue of it. But (R ,  S > exempli f ies 
neither of thine pn)pertles, and 'The round ~quare ts not ~uare"  ts 
t rue  In v i r tue  of  lhtll, i.e., 'I'~" Is .imhl~UOUS.

Terence Parsons's theory of nonexistent oh\]eeLs (1980; cf.

intenstonal ones- -and onl~" one m(xle of predlcatton. But it has two

7. CASTANI rDA'S  THEORY.  
I lector-N~ri Castan'eda's theory  of "guises" (1972, 1975a-c. 
1977, 197q. 1980) is a better  .~ndidate .  It is a fu l l y  intensional  
theory  w i th  one type of oh!oct: guises (intensional i tems 
cor r~pond ing  to ~t.q ,if propert ies),  and one type of property .  More 
pret t i l y ,  there are propert ies (e.g., being round, being square, being 
blue .... ). ~ees of these (called guise cores: e.g., {being round, being 
squaret), and an ont ic counterpart ,  c,  or the detimte-descript lon 
operator ,  wh ich  ns used to fo rm guises; e.g.. c{being round, being 
square| is the round square.  Guises can be understood,  rough ly ,  as 
th ings -under -a -descr tp tmn.  ~,s " facets"  of (phys ica l  and non-  
phys ica l )  ob.l~t.s, as "ro les" that  ohjecr,s p lay,  or, in general ,  as 
objects t)l" thought .  
Gu i~ theory  has two modes of predicat ion:  internal and 
external  In genera l ,  the gu i~ c l . . .  F . . .  } i s - in terna l ly  t ' .  I:..g., 
the gut~ (named by)  the round square i s -mterna l ly  on ly  round 
and square.  The  two guises the tallest mountain and &It. Everest 
are related hv an  externa l  mode of  predicat ion cal led consubstantia- 
lion (C'*). Consuh~tantmtnon is an equ iva lence relat ion that  is u~d 
in the ana lyses  of  ( I )  externa l  predicat ion,  (2) co-reference,  and  (3) 
existence: l,et a = c {. . .  / " . . .  } be a guise and let 
a\[fi l =~f c({. . . 1" . . .}  u l(; }). Then( I )a  ~s-externa l ly ( ;  ( in one 
,sense) if C~(a. a\[G \]). For instance. "the Morn ing Star  ts a p lanet '  is 
t rue  because C~( c t M .  S }, c { M . S,  P }): i.e.. the Morning Star and 
the Morning Star that is a planet are consu l~tant la ted .  (2 )Gut~ a
