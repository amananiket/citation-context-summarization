Cons ider  a device designed to read a text  in some r~tura l  
language~ in terpret  i t ,  and s tore  the content in some manner~ say, 
fop the purpose of  being able to answer  quest ions about i t .  To 
accompl i sh  th is  task~ the machine w i l l  have to fu l f i l \ [  at \ [east  he 
fo l low ing  baste requ i rement .  It has to be ab|e to bui ld a f i l e  that  
cons is ts  o f  records  o f -a l l  the individuals~ that  is~ events~ objects~ 
etc .  ~ ment ioned in the text~ and~ for  e~eh individual~ record  whatever  
is said about i t .  OF couPse~ fop the t ime being at \[east~ i t  seems that  
such a text  in terpreter  is  not a praet ica \ [  idea~ but th is  should not 
d iscourage us f rom studying. in  abstPaet what  kind o f  capab i l i t i es  the 
machine would have to possess~ prov ided that  our  study prov ides  us 
w i th  some ins ight  into natura l  langL~ge in genera l .  
In th is  paper  I intend to  d iscuss one par t i cu la r  feature  a text  
in terpreter  must  have: that  i t  must  be able to recognize  when a novel  
indiv idual  is ment ioned in the input text  and to s to re  i t  atong w i th  i ts  
character i za t ion  fop fu ture  re ference .  Of course~ in some P_~ses the 
prob lem is t r i v ia l .  Suppose there  appears  in some sentence a proper  
name that  has not been ment ioned prev ious ly .  Th is  means that  a new 
-2- 
pePson is being intPoduced in the text and appPopPiate action must  be 
taken to PecoPd the name of the pePson and what is said about him. 
OthePwise, the pPopeP name is used to PefeP to an individual already 
mentioned and the machine has to locate his file in the memory  with 
the help of the name.  This pPob lem of identification wilt be mope 
difficult where  a definite descPiption--a definite noun phPase such as 
the man Bill saw 7estePda~,--is used, since thePe will, in genePal, 
not be any simple look-up procedure fop associating the descPiption 
with the Pight individual. With definite noun phrases there is also the 
pPob lem that it is not possible to tell just f rom the noun phPase itself 
whetheP oP not it is supposed to refer" to an individual at all. Fop  
example,  it is cleaP that the phPase the best student is not used 
PefePentiaUy in a sentence such as Bill is the best student. -\[-here ape 
thus two prob lems with ordinary definite noun phrases: (i) Is it a 
definite descPiption at all? and (ii) How to match  a definite descPiption 
with an individual already mentioned in the text? The  fiPst question is 
clearly of the kind linguists can be expected to solve, but it will not be 
discussed here. The  only aspect of definite descPiptions that interests 
us hepe is the fact that they caPPy an existential presupposition: to 
call something "the ... " presupposes that there be some such thing. 
Whi le it is in genePal a stPaight-for~vaPd matter- to decide 
-3 -  
whether  o r  not a .p roper  name in a text  in t roduces  a new ind iv idual ,  
indef in i te  noun phrases pose a more  d i f f i cu l t  p robtem.  To  put the 
quest ion in a general  way:  Given an indef in i te  noun phrase,  under 
what  c i rcumstances  is there  supposed to be an indiv idual  descr ibed 
by th is  noun phrase? Th is  need not be understood as some sor t  off 
onto log ica l  question subject  to phi losophical  speculat ion,  in th i s  
paper" \[ intend to approach it  f rom a purety  l ingu is t i c  point of v iew.  
It  is  in just  those cases where  the appearance o f  an indef in i te  NP 
imp l ies  the ex is tence of  some spec i f i c  ent i ty  that  our  hypothet ica l  
text  in terpreter  shoutd record  the appearance of  a new ind iv idua l .  
What \[ have in mind can perhaps be made c lear  w ~:h the hetp 
of  the fo l low ing  examples ,  i t  is  a wat t -known fact  about language that  
indef in i te  noun phrases  cannot be in terpreted  as re fer ' r ing  to expres -  
s ions when they appear, in the pred icate  nomina l  pos i t ion.  
( l )  B i t l  is  not a l ingu is t .  
( l )  is  obv iousty  a s ta tement  about one ind iv idua l .  I t  is  not a s ta tement  
about some l ingu is t  and \[Bil l .  I t  is  a lso we i r -known that  in gener ic  
sentences s ingutar  indef in i te  noun phrases p lay a pecu l ia r  ro te .  
(2) A t ion is a mighty  hunter`. 
In i ts  gener'ic sense, (2) is a s ta tement  about t ions in genera l ,  
not about any t ion in part icu lar , ,  unless we want  to  postulate a 
-4 -  
hypothet i ca l  ent i ty  ' the typ ica l  l i on '  of  whom a l l  gener ic  s ta tements  
about  l i ons  ape pred icated .  It  i s  c lear  that  indef in i te  noun phrases  
have a very  spec ia l  Pole in ( l )  and (2) and i t  is  not d i f f i cu l t  to  dec ide  
that  they  cou ld  not in t roduce  any new ind iv idua ls  in to  a d i scourse .  It  
i s  out of  quest ion  that  a text  in wh ich  (1) appears  wou ld  conta in  a 
later" re fe rence  to  ' the l ingu is t  wh ich  B i t t  i s  not '  o r  that  (2), in i t s  
gener ic  sense,  wou ld  jus t i fy  a la te r  re fe rence  to  ' the l i on  who i s  a 
mighty  hunter ' .  
But  cons ider  the fo l low ing  example .  (3a) may be fo l lowed by  
any  of  the  sentences  (3b-d)  that  g ive  us more  in fo rmat ion  about a 
spec i f i c  cap f i r s t  ment ioned  in (3a).  
(b) I t  i s  b lack .  
(3) (a) B i t t  has a car'. (c) The  car  is  b lack .  
(d) B i l l ' s  cap i s  b lack .  
On the o ther  hand, (4a) cannot  be fo l lowed by any of  the a l te rnat ives  
(4b-d) .  
(b) * I t  i s  b lack .  
(4) (a) B i l l  doesn ' t  have a car .  (c)  *The  cap i s  b lack .  
(d) *B i l l ' s  cap i s  b lack .  
The  above examples  show that  jus t  in case of  (3a),  the text  
in terpreter  has to  recogn ize  that  the appearance  of  the indef in i te  NP  
a cap i rnpt ies  the ex is tence  of  a spec i f i c  car- that  can be ta lked  about  
aga in  by  re fe r r ing  to  i t  w i th  a p ronoun or" a de f in i te  noun phrase .  But  
no cap i s  in t roduced  by  (4a).  The  a l te rnat ive  cont inuat ions  (4b-d)  a re  
inappropr ia te ,  s ince  they  presuppose  the ex is tence  of  someth ing  that  
i s  not  there .  To  show that  th i s  i s  a l ingu is t i c  and not  an onto log ica l  
-5 -  
fact  one only has to point out that  examples  (5) and (6) behave just  
l i ke  (3) and (4). 
(5) B i l l  saw a un icorn .  The un icorn  had a gold mane.  
(6) B i l l  d idn't  see a un icorn .  *The unicorn had a gold mane.  
Let  us say that the appearance of  an indef in i te  noun phrase es tab l i shes  
a d iscourse  re ferent  just  in case it  jus t i f i es  the occur rence  of: a 
corererent ia l  pronoun or  a def in i te  noun phrase hater in the text .  In 
th i s  paper we w i l l  t ry  to f ind out under what  c i rcumstances  d i scourse  
re ferents  are establ ished.  We mainta in  that the prob lem of  corefer - -  
ence w i th in  a d iscourse  is a l ingu is t i c  p rob lem and can be studied 
independent ly of  any genera l  theory  of ext ra - l ingu is t i c  re fe rence .  
The present  study was insp i red  by the notion o f  ' re fe rent ia l  
ind ices '  in t rans format iona l  g rammar .  Fo l low ing  a suggest ion by 
Noam Chomsky (1965), i t  has genera l ly  been assumed that  the base 
component of  a t rans format iona l  g rammar  assoc iates  w i th  each noun 
phrase a re ferent ia l  index, say, some in teger .  The purpose of  
Chomsky 's  proposal  was not so much to account fo r  the meaning of  
sentences,  but to augment the notion of  noun phrase ident i ty .  I t  
seemed that  the notion o f  ' re fe rent ia l  ident i ty '  was needed in addi t ion 
to the two o ther  types o f  ident i ty ,  ' s t ruc tura l  ident i ty '  and 'morphemic  
ident i ty ' ,  fo r  the s t ruc tura l  descr ip t ions  of  cer ta in  t rans format ions .  
Accord ing  to the s tandard theory ,  re fe rent ia l  ind ices  are mere ly

They  amP not meant  to  imp ly  the ex is tence  of  d i scourse  re ferents  in our  
sense .  Th is  not ion  o f  cor~fempnt ia l i ty  has p layed  an impor tant  ro le  in

l .  1 A note on spec i f i c i ty  
\[n the  fo l low ing  we amP going to  examine  case by  case cer ta in  
aspects  o f  sentence  s t ruc ture  that  p lay  a ro le  in c le termin ing  whether  
an indef in i te  NP  es tab l i shes  a d iscourse  re ferent .  In the examples  
that  ape d iscussed~ there  i s  a poss ib le  ambigu i ty  that  has to  be men-  
t ioned  in advance ,  a l though i t  wil l  not  be d i scussed  unt i l  l a te r .  In 
genera l ,  indef in i te  noun phrases  have both a spec i f i c  and nor r - spec i f i c  
in terpretat ion .  Example  (7) can be in terpreted  to  mean e i ther  (8a) o r  
(Bb). 
(7) 
(8) 
B i l l  d idn ' t  see a mispr in t .  
(a)  'There  is  a mispr in t  wh ich  B i l l  d idn ' t  see' 
(b) 'Bi l l  saw no misprints' 
-7 -  
\[1 = (7) iS Understood in the sense of (8a), we say that the 
indef in i te  NP a mispr in t  is in te rpreted  spec i f i ca l l y .  (Sb) represents  
the non-spec i f i c  in te rpreta t ion .  OF course ,  not a l l  indef in i te  noun 
phrases are  ambiguous in th is  way.  We could d isambiguate  (7) by 
adding the word  cer ta in  ( "a  cer ta in  mispr in t " )  o r  an appos i t ive  
re la t ive  c lause ( "a  mispr in t ,  which I had made on purpose") .  These 
changes would a l low on ly  the spec i f i c  in te rpreta t ion  (8a). The add i -  
t ion  of  the word  ~ ( "a  s ingle mispr in t " )  would a l low only  the 
sense (Sb). There  a re  also cases where  the verbs  invo lved par t ia l l y  
d isambiguate  the sentence by  mak ing  one in terpreta t ion  
Far more  p laus ib le  to the reader  than the other .  For  example ,  the 
NP a piano in (9a) is  natura l l y  understood non-spec i f i ca l l y ,  that  is ,  as 
meaning 'any piano' ,  whi te  the same noun phrase in (9b) suggests the 
l 
interpretation 'a certain pianO'. 
(9) (a) John t r ied  to  f ind a piano. 
(b) John t r ied  to l i f t  a piano. 
(but he d idn ' t  succeed in 
f ind ing one\]  
\ [but  he d idn ' t  succeed in 
l i f t ing  i t \ ]  
It  i s  someth ing about the verb  l i f t  that suggests that a piano descr ibes  
some spec i f i c  ob ject .  On the o ther  hand, (9a) is  eas i l y  understood to 
in fo rm us on ly  about the k ind of  ob ject  John was t ry ing  to f ind .  We note 
in passing that,  i f  i n te rpreted  in the above manner ,  (9b) es tab l i shes  a 
-8 -  
d i scourse  re ferent ,  i . e . ,  'the piano John t r ied  to l i f t ' ,  but (9a) 
cer ta in ly  does not jus t i fy  a la ter  re fe rence  to 'the piano John t r ied  
to Find'. Example  (7) es tab l i shes  a re ferent  in i t s  spec i f i c  sense 
'the mispr in t  wh ich  B i t t  d idn't  see ' ,  but fa i l s  to do so in the sense, 
of (Sb). 
I_et us fo rget ,  fo r  the t ime being, that  indef in i te  noun phrases 
can a lso be understood spec i f i ca l l y  and cons ider  f i r s t  on ly  non-spec i f -  
ic in terpreta t ions .  
1.2 Complement  c lauses 
As  pointed out above, an indef in i te  noun phrase does genera l ly  
es tab l i sh  a d i scourse  referent when it  appears  in a s imp le  a f f i rmat ive  
sentence.  But i f  the sentence is negated, a non-spec i f i c  NP fe l t s  to 
es tab l i sh  a re ferent .  Le t  us, tentat ive ly ,  accept th i s  f inding fo r  
s imp le  sentences and took  at cases where  an indef in i te  NP belongs to 
a complement  c lause.  There  are  many o ther  fac tors  that  play a rote  
here  bes ides negat ion.  
\ ] .  21 Moda l  verbs  
The fo l low ing  examples  a re  anomalous  in the intended sen&e, 
a l though there  is  no negat ion invo lved.  
(10) (a) You must  wr i te  a le t te r  to your  parents .  *They  are  
expect ing the le t te r .  
(b) B i l l  can make a k i te .  *The k i te has a tong s t r ing .  
-9- 
Tr`aditionalty~ sentences with a modal  auxiliary have been considered 
as simple sentences. However~ it has been argued convincingly by 
Ross  (1967a) and others that modals  should be analyzed as main  ver"bs 
o? higher` sentences. Therefore~ let us assume that~ even in the above 
examples~ the indefinite NPs  originate in a complement  clause~ just 
as they do in (l l). 
( l \ ] )  (a) John wants  to c~toh a f i sh .  *Do you see the f ish f rom 
here? 
(b) Mary  expects  to have a baby. *The baby's name is 
Sue. 
There  is a great  number` of  verbs  that  behave l i ke  want  and e_.~pect in 
th is  respect~ e .g .  ~ try~ ptan~ ~ hope~ etc .  What is  common to 
al l  o f  them is that  the complement  sentence by i t se l f  is  understood to 
represent  a yet  untrue propos i t ion  at the t ime spec i f ied by the tense 
and t ime adverb ia l s  in the main c lause.  The present pr`oblem~ is  in 
fact~ another  point in favor` of  the v iew that  modals  o r ig inate  in a 
higher" sentence~ because i t  enables us to acknowledge the s imi la r i ty  
of  the anomaly  in (10) and ( \ ]1 ) .  The conct'usion is that  non-spec i f i c  
indef in i tes  do not estab l ish  d iscourse  re ferents  when they appear` in a 
complement  of  a modal  verb .  
l. 22 I mplicatives 
There  is a class of verbs that~ if they are not negated~ imply 
the truth of the proposition represented by their" complement  sentence. 
Let us call them implicative verbs. 2 In English~ this group includes 
- lO -  
vePbs such as  manage,  r 'emembeP,  venture ,  see f i t ,  etc .  An indef i -  
n i te NP  in the complement  o f  an imp l i ca t ive  vePb es tab l i shes  a re fer -  
ent ,  as  shown by the fo l low ing  examples .  
(12) (a) John managed to f ind  an apar tment .  The  apar tment  
has a ba lcony .  
(b) B i l l  ventuPed to  ask  a quest ion .  The  lectuPer- 
answePed i t .  
But  i f  the imp l i ca t ive  vePb in the main  sentence i s  negated,  a non-  
spec i f i c  . indef in i te  fa i l s  to  es tab l i sh  a PefePent.  
(13) (a) John d idn ' t  manage to  f ind  an apaPtment .  *The  apar ' t -  
rr.~nt has a ba lcony .  
(b) B i l l  d idn ' tdaPe  to  ask  a ,question. *The  lec turer"  
answe Ped i t .  
There  ape a l so  verbs  that  inhePent ly  have a negat ive  imp l i ca t ion .  In 
Eng l i sh ,  th i s  type inc ludes  ver 'bs  such as  foP~t ,  fa i l ,  and neg lec t .  
Cons ider"  the fo l low ing  anomalous  d iscour"ses .  
(14) (a)  John for-got  to  wr"ite a tePm paper". *He cannot  show 
i t  to  the teacher".  
(b) John fa i led  to  f ind  an answer". * I t  was  wr"ong. 
These  imp l i ca t ive  ver"bs have the ver"y in teres t ing  pr"oper"ty that ,  i f  
i 
there  i s  double  negat ion ,  the imp l i ca t ion  i s  pos i t i ve ,  and an indef in i te  
NP does ,  after" all~ es tab l i sh  a re ferent .  
-11 -  
(14) (a) John d idn ' t  fa i l  to f ind  an answer .  The answer  was  
even r ight .  
(b) John d idn ' t  remember"  not to  br ing  an umbre l la ,  
a l though we had no room for" i t .  
Th is  pr`operty  d i s t ingu ishes  c lear ly  verbs  w i th  negat ive  imp l i ca t ion ,  
such as  for` ge.___, tt, fr`orn moda l  verbs  d i scussed  above,  a l though both 
types  deny the tr`uth o f  the  propos i t ion  represented  by the complement  
sentence.  
1 .23 Fact ive  verbs  
There  i s  a group  o? verbs ,  ca l led  fac t tve  verbs  (K iparsky  1968), 
that  p resuppose  the t ru th  o f  the propos i t ion  represented  by the corn -  
p lement .  For" example ,  know, realty_e, and regret  a re  fac t ive .  It i s  
not surpr - i s tng to  f ind  out that  an indef in i te  NP does es tab l i sh  a re fer 'ent  
in a complement  o f  a fac t ive  verb ,  o f  course ,  p rov ided  that  the com-  
p lement  i t se l f  i s  a f f i rmat ive .  
(15) John knew that  aar`y  had a car', but he had never" seen i t .  
In contr"ast to the imp l i ca t ive  ver"bs d i scussed  above,  negat ion  in the 
main  sentence has no e f fec t  at art .  
( \ ]6 )  B i t l  d idn ' t  rea l i ze  that  he had a d ime.  It was  in h i s  pocket 
The t ru th  o f  the embedded prepos i t ion  is  p resupposed  even i f  the fac -  
r i ve  ver"b i t se l f  i s  negated.  Oonsequent ly ,  (16) i s  qui te acceptab le  as  a 
cont inu ing  d i scourse .  
-12 -  
l .  24 Non- fac t ive  verbs  
The  c lass  o f  verbs  commonly  ca l led  non- fac t ive  (K iparsky  
\ ]968)  inc ludes  such verbs  as  be l ieve ,  thin_~k~ say~ c la im~ doubt.  In 
genera l  ~ noth ing i s  p resupposed  about  the  t ru th  o f  the embedded prop-  
os i t ion .  Not ice~ however~ ~?hat l~efo l low ing  d iscourse  wou ld  be 
contradictory. 
(17) I doubt that Mary has a car. *Bil l has seen it, 
On the other hand, ther~ ism~thing v~ong with the following example. 
(18) Bi l l  dou~ts-that Mary has a car. I have seen it. 
What makes these verbs difficult ?o handle is that there are two per- 
sons involved: the ~ l~r  and the subject of the non-factive verJo - -  
these ro les  may~ o f  couPse~ co inc ide .  The  speaker  i s  not  commit ted  
to any view whatsoeverabout  the truth of the L~rnbedded proposition, 
although he may imply what  his beliefs are as the discourse continues. 
For  exampie~ in (18), the speaker--unlike Bill---must hold that the 
complement  is true. The  non-f-active verb is binding for the speaker 
on ly  in case he is ta lk ing  in  the f i r s t  person  as in ( \ ]7 ) .  BUt even  in  
case that  the speaker  w i thho lds  judgment  o r  d i sagrees  a l together~ an 
indef in i te  NP  in  the complement  o f  a non- fac t ive  verb  that  imp l ies  
pos i t i ve  be l ie f  does es tab l i sh  a re ferent  o f  a pecu l ia r  sor t .  It can be 
I 
re fer red  to  aga in  in a complement  o f  a s imi la r  non- fac t ive  verb  that  
has  the same sub jec t .  
-18- 
(19) Bill says he saw a lion on the street. He claims the lion 
had escaped f rom the Zoo. 
What  this amounts  to is that a text interpreting device will have to sort 
out what belongs to 'the world as seen by the speaker' and" 'the world 
as seen by X'. The same referents need not exist in all of these 
worlds. 
A nor~fact ive  vePb that  imp l ies  pos i t ive  be l ie f  (clairr~, th ink ,  
be l ieve,  say,  e tc . )  a l lows  an indef in i te  NP in the complement  to 
estab l i sh  a re ferent  as fa r  as the wor ld  o f  the subject  person is corr- 
cer'ned but need not have the same e f fec t  in the speaker ' s  wor ld .  A 
non-factive verb with negative implication (doLLb._~t) may still allow that 
a referent is added to the speaker's world, albeit not to the world of 
the subject person. There is a spirited study of 'other worlds' by 
Lakof~ (1968b). 
l .  25 Genera\[  remar 'ks  
We can now genePalize the previous'  observat ion  about s ingle 
sentences to cover  a lso complement  c lauses.  A non-spec i f i c  in -  
def in i te  NP in an a f f i rmat ive  sentence (s ingle sentence or  a comple -  
ment)  es tab l i shes  a d iscourse  re ferent  just  in case the propos i t ion  
represented  by the Sentence is assePted~ impl ied  or" presupposed 
by the speaker  to be t rue .  A non-spec i f i c  indef in i te  in a negat ive  
-14 -  
sentence es tab l i shes  a re ferent  on ly  i f  the propos i t ion  i s  imp l ied  to  
be False. This latter stipulation is needed because of negative 
implicatives discussed in ~ 1.22. In general, discourse referents 
exist in the rea lm 'world as seen by the speaker'. However ,  
the non-factive verbs discussed in ? I. 24 establish referents 
in other rea lms and are ambiguous  as far as the speaker is 
concerned. 
In order to decide whether  or not a non-specifEc in- 
definite NP  is to be associated with a referent, a text interpreting 
device must  be able to assign a truth value to the proposition 
represented by the sentence in which the NP  appears. It must  
be sensitive to the semantic properVcies of verbs that take 
sentential complements ,  distin~ish between assertion, 
implication, and presupposition, and f\[nally, it must  distinguish 
what exists for the speaker f rom what exists only for somebody  
else. 
l .  26 An apparent  counterexample  
There  is  an in teres t ing  group  o f  verbs  that  seem to  
prov ide  a counter 'example  to  the genera l  ru le .  Cons{der  the fo l low-  
ing d i scourses .  
(20) (a) l need a caP_. * I t  was a Mustang.

In fact, these are the same modal v~s  discussed above (?1.21) 
that imply that the proposition represented by the complement is 
not yet true. We can thus account for  tile l~culiarity of (20a-d) 
by assuming that, in spite of the simplicity-of the su~ce 
structure, the ordinary noun phrase objects of these verbs 
are derived f rom underlying r ~ ~ o n s  .which contain

I. 4 Supposi t ions 
Another  way  to talk about what  is not is to suppose  that it 
is. Cons ider  the following discourses. 
(28)  (a)  Suppose  Mary  had a car .  She  takes  me to  work  
in  i t .  " I d r ive  the  car  too .  
(b) I f  tv~ary has  a oar~ she  will take me to  work  in it. 
I can drive the cam too. 
(c )  I f  Mary  had a cam~ she  wou ld  take  me to  work  in  i t .  
I cou ld  dr ive  the  car  too .  
(d)  I w ish  Mary  had a car .  She  wou ld  take  me to  work  
in  i t .  I cou ld  dr ive  the  car  too .  
(e)  When Mary  has  a car~ she can  take  me to  work  in  
in it. I can drive the car  too. 
All of the above  examples  elaborate a hypothetical situation that 
is based  on the counter1:actual or  dubious premise  that Mary  has 
a car .  The  difference between the first and  the second pair is 
that in (28c--d) the condition is impl ied to be unrealizable or  hard  
to realize. There  are clearly several  ways  in wh ich  a supposition 
may be introduced in a discourse. Essentially~ however~ all of the 
- Z{  - 
above examples  reduce to  the fo rm IF  S O THEN S l . $2  ? ? ? Sn" 
Whatever  re fe rent  is  in t roduced by S O ex is ts  fop the sequence 
S \ [ -Sn ,  wh ich  apparent ly  has no f i xed  length,  although there  
obv ious ly  ape cer ta in  condi t ions that a l l  sentences belonging 
to  i t  have to fu l l f / l \ ] .  The fo l low ing  d iscourse  would be 
anomalous .  
(29) I w ish  Mary  had a car .  *I w i l l  d r ive  i t .  
That  is~ f / c t i t ious  ind iv iduals  may be re fer red  to  ~naphoPical ly  
only  as long as the proper  f i c t i t ious  mode is sustained,  but when 
the i l l us ion  i s  b roken ,  they  cease to  ex is t .  
As  the above examples  show~ a text  in terpreter  must  a lso 
be able to  cope w i th  shor t  tePr~ re ferents  that  owe the i r  ex is tence 
to some condi t ion that  in rea l i ty  is  not fu l f i l l ed .  I t  must  catch 
a supposition in whcx~tever foPn3 it comes and recognize  where  
the supposi t ion ceases to  be in fo rce .  Ne i ther  o f  the two  tasks  
is  l i ke ly  to  be easy .  FoP example ,  what  looks  l ike  oomman d may~ 
nevertheless, be a supposi t ion.

1.5 Commands  and Yes -No  Quest ions 
I t  i s  to  be expected that  indef in i te  noun phrases  in commands  
and Yes -No  quest ions fa i l  to  int roduce re ferents .  The propos i t ion  
- 2 2 .  
cor respond ing  to an in ter rogat ive  o r  imperat ive  sentence ord inar i l y  
is not assumed to be t rue .  Thus there  is someth ing miss ing  in 
the fo l low ing  examples .  
(3l)  (a) Does John have a car?  * I t  is  a Mustang.  
(b) Give me a hotdog, p lease.  * I t  looks  de l i c ious .  
But i t  is  again poss ib le  to have coPeference w i th in  the imperat ive  
o r  in ter rogat ive  sequence i t se l f .  
(32) (a) Does John have a car  and is  i t  a Mustang? 
(b) Give me a hotdog~ please,  but don' t  put 
any mustard  on i t .  
There  are ,  however ,  ways  to in terpret  the fo l low ing  examples  as 
acceptab le .  
(33) (a) Did you wr i te  a le t te r?  Let  me see i t .  
(b) Give me a hotdog, p lease.  I w i l l  eat i t .  
For  example ,  the in ter rogat ive  sentence in (88a) need not be 
taken as a t rue  quest ion at a l l ,  but as an express ion  ol = 
surpr i se  prompted by a preceding asser t ion .  (33b) could 
be understood as e l l ip t i c .  What is  imp l i c i t  is  "You  w i l l  
g ive me a hotdog. " D iscourses  such as in (33) c lear ly  ape 
not counterexamples ,  s ince the i r  acceptab i l i ty  i s  not due 
to the appearance of  an indef in i te  NP in a command or  
Yes -No  quest ion,  but to o ther  cons iderat ions .

l .  6 Quanti l=iers 
IndeFinite noun phrases  are  genera l ly  ambiguous  in 
sentences  that  conta in  quant i f ie r - l i ke  express ions .  The 
Fo l lowing examples  can be unders tood  at leas t  in two ways .  
(34) (a) Ha hvey cour ts  a g i r l  at every  convent ion .  
(b) Most  boys  in th i s  town are  in love  wi th  a 
go -go  dancer .  
(84a) can mean that ,  at every  convent ion ,  there  is  some 
g i r l  that  Harvey  cour ts ,  o r  that  there  is  some g i r l  that  
Harvey  cour ts  at every  convent ion .  Let  us ca l l  the above 
paraphrases  the non-spec i f i c  and the spec i f i c  in terpretat ion  
o f  the N P a~r l ,  respect ive ly .  (See the note on spec i f i c i ty  
in 6 l . t . )  in the spectCtc sense,  Harvey  a lways  cour ts  the 
same g i r l ,  in  the non-spec i f i c  sense,  i t  may  be a 
d i~erent  g i r l  each t ime.  S imi la r ly ,  a go -go  dancer  in (3413) 
a l so  has two in terpretat ions .  However ,  the  Fo l lowing d iscourses  
leave  no room for  such ambigu i ty .  
(35) (a) Harvey  cour ts  ag i r l  at every  convent ion .  
She is  very  pret ty .  
(b) Most  boys  in th i s  town are  in love  w i th  ago-go  
dancer' .  Mary  doesn ' t  l i ke  her  at  a l l .  
- Z 4 -  
in  (35), on ly  the spec i f i c  in terpretat ion  is  poss ib le .  There  must  
be a unique g i r l  and a un ique go-go  dancer .  Th is  fac t  ind icates  
that  a non-spec i f i c  indef in i te  fa i l s  to  es tab l i sh  a d i scourse  re ferent  
in case there  is  a quant i f ie r ' - l i ke  te rm in  the sentence ,  in sp i te  o f  
the fac t  that  the sentence is  an a f f i rmat ive  asser t ion .  
But  not i ce  that  the  fo l low ing  example  i s  ambiguous  aga in .  
(36) Harvey  cOurts  a g i r l  at every  convent ion .  She  a lways  
comes  to  the banquet  w i th  h im.  The  g i r l  i s  usua l ly  a l so  
very  pret ty .  
(36) admi ts  both the spec i f i c  and non-spec i f i c  in terpretat ion  of  a g i r l .  
The  reason  for" the anomaly  o f  the  non-spec i f i c  in terpretat ion  in (35) 
and i t s  acceptab i l i ty  here  is  apparent ly  that ,  in (36), every  success ive  
sentence  cont inues  to  have a s imi la r  quant i f ie r - - l i ke  te rm:  "a t  every  
convent ion" ,  "a lways" ,  "usua l ly" .  There  is  a l so  noth ing  wrOng wi th  
~he non-spec i f i c  in terpretat ion  o f  the NP  a book  in (37).  
(37) Every  t ime B i l l  comes  here ,  he p icks  up a book  and 
wants  to  bor row i t .  I never  le t  h im take  the book .  
We have to  say  that ,  a l though a non-spec i f i c  indef in i te  that  fa l l s  in to  
the scope o f  a quant i f ie r  fa i l s  to  es tab l i sh  a permanent  d i scourse

quant i f ie r  and i t s  l i fe -span  may be extended by  f lagg ing  every  succes -  
s ive  sentence  w i th  a quant i f ier"  o f  the same type .  4

2 .  Spec i f i c i ty  
Let  us now re turn  to the prob lem of spec i f i c i ty  that was F irst  
in t roduced in ? 1.1. As we a l ready  pointed out, many of the examples  
above that were  judged anomalous  in the intended sense can also be 
given another  in terpreta t ion  that  makes them per fec t ly  acceptable .  
0 
Although 'non-spec i f i c '  indeFinites do not permi t  eoreFerence in (88), 
there is  nothing wrong  wi th  these examples  prov ided  that the indef i -  
nite NP is  understood ' spec i f i ca l l y ' .  
(88) (a) B i l l  d idn ' t  f ind a mispr in t .  Can you Find i t?  
(b) John wants to catch a f i sh .  You can see the f i sh  
f rom here .  
How should we represent  th i s  d i s t inc t ion?  As  the te rms ' spec i f i c '  and 
'non-spec i f i c '  imp ly ,  t rans format iona l  g rammar ians  have t rad i t iona l ly  
assumed that there  is  a feature  \ [+spec i f i c \ ] ,  just  as there  i s  a feature  
F+deFinite\], and that indef in i te  NPs  a re  to  be marked  wi th  respect  to  
spec i f i c i ty .  Let  us ca l l  th i s  v iew,  that goes together  wi th  Chomsky 's  
o r ig ina l  proposa l  that  Core?erence be marked  w i th  integer-- type ind ices ,  
the c lass ica l  theory .  There  is  a lso another  approach to these, p rob-  
lems suggested by Emmon Bach (1968), James  O. McOawley  (1967), 
George l_ako?-?, and others .  The essent ia l  feature  ol = the i r  p roposa ls  
is that re fe rent ia l  ind ices  are  var iab les ,  bound by  quant i f ie rs  that act 
l ike quant i f ie rs  in symbo l i c  log ic .  What cor responds  to the indef in i te  
- Z6  - 
a r t i c le  i s ,  o f  course ,  someth ing very  s imi la r  to  the ex is tent ia l  
quant i f ie r  in p red icate  ca lcu lus .  (Bach ca l l s  i t  ' the some operator ' . )  
Base s t ruc tures  resemble  fo rmulas  in symbo l i c  log ic .  Th is  approach 
to syntax  has now become known as 'generat ive  semant ics ' .  
It i s  easy  to see that  in the f ramework  o f  generat ive  semant ics  
e 
there  is no jus t i f i ca t ion  nor  need fo r  a feature  such as \ [+spec i f i c \ ] .  
The ambigu i t ies  in quest ion ape natura l ly  accounted fop by the fac t  
that  the quant i f ie r  binding var iab le  that  under l ies  some indef in i te  
noun phrase may be placed in d i f fe rent  pos i t ions  in the base 
s t ruc ture .  Spec i f i c i ty  thus becomes  a ITiEtter o f  the scope of  
quant i f ie  r s .  
As  fa r  as the prob lems d iscussed in th i s  paper  ape re levant  
to choosing a theoPet ica l  f ramework~ they  seem to  argue in favor  of  
adopt ing the Bach-McOawle~ proposa ls ,  I t  i s  ra ther  d i f f i cu l t  to  see, 
how one could achieve an adequate descr ip t ion  o f  the fac ts  in the 
c lass ica l  theory ,  FoP example~ cons ider  the fo l low ing  case.  Both 
(39a) and (39b) a re  ambiguous w i th  respect  to spec i f i c i ty .  
(39) (a) B i l l  intends to v i s i t  a museum.  
(b) B i l l  v i s i t s  a museum every  day. 
In the tspec i f i c t  sense~ both examples  estab l i sh  a discouPse re ferent .  
q 
I t  wou ld  make  per fec t  sense to  cont inue w i th  a descP~:~tion of  lthe 
museum B i l l  intends to  v i s i t  t o r  fthe museum B i l l  v i s i t s  every  day' .  
- 2 7 -  
In the 'non-spec i f i c '  sense, there  is no such museum at a l l .  So fa r  
so good, we can say that  the NP a museum can be r+spec i f i c \ ] .  But 
what  about example  (40)? 
(40) B i l l  intends to v i s i t  a museum every  day. 
It is  c lear  that  (40) is  ambiguous in many  ways .  For  example ,  
the quant i f ied t ime adverb  every  day could be assigned e i ther  to the 
complement  o r  to the main  c lause,  le t  us now cons ider  on ly  the For-  
mer  case. The remain ing  ambigu i t ies  should be a t t r ibutab le  to the 
indef in i te  NP a museum,  in Fact, we should have a two--way ambigu i ty  
between the specific and nort-specific interpretation. But example  
(40) is stilt ambiguous in more  than two ways.  It could be inter- 
preted to mean (41a)~ (41b), or  (41c). 
(41) (a) 'There is a certain museum that Bi l l  intends to 
vis i t  every day. ' 
(b) 'Bi l l  intends that there be some museum that he 
visits every day. ' 
(c) 'Bi l l  intends to do a museum visit  every day. ' 
It is easy to see why this happens. What the feature F?specific\] 
accomplishes in case of (39a) is that it c lar i f ies the relation between 
the indefinite NP a museum and the verb intend in the main sentence: 
Is B i l l ' s  intention about some part icular museum or  not? In (39b), 
we employed the same device to characterize the relation between 
- Z8 .  
the  quant i f ied  t ime a d v e r b ~  and the indef in i te  noun phrase:  
Is i t  the same museum every  day or  not? To  do the work  in (40) we 
would  need two  features~ one to character i ze  the re la t ion  between 
intend anda  museum,  another  fo r  the re la t ion  between a museum 
and every  day.  Under  the in terpreta t ion  (4\ ]b) ,  fo r  exampte ,  _a 
museum would  be non-spec i f i c  w i th  respect  to the  verb  intend but 
spec i f i c  w i th  respect  to the quant i f ied t ime expr-ession.  But  to say 
that  there  a re  severa l  var ie t ies  of  spec i f i c i ty  is  a way  of saying that 
there  is  no feature  r+spec i f i c \ ]  at a l t .  The c tass icat  theory  c lear ly  
is  not su f f i c ient  to  account fo r  the mul t ip le  meanings  of  (40).5 
On the o ther  hand, in the Bach-McOawtey  f ramework  we are  
able to  account fo r  the ambigu i t ies  in a st ra ight- for~Nard way.  The 
three  senses of  (40) d iscussed above might  be represented  rough ly  as

Another  advantage of generat ive  semant ics  is  that  there  is  an exp lana-  
t ion  ready  fo r  the fact  that  (40) es tab l i shes  a d iscourse  re fe rent  under  
on ly  one of  the th ree  in terpreta t ions  we have cons idered,  narnely  (42a). 
I 
The ru le  i s  that  an indef in i te  NP es tab l i shes  a permanent  re fe rent  just  
in case the propos i t ion  to  wh ich  the b ind ing quant i f ie r  is  attached is  
- 29 -  
assumed (asser ted ,  imp l ied ,  o r  presupposed) to be t rue ,  prov ided 
that the quant i f ie r  is not i t se l f  in the scope of some h igher  quant i f ie r .  7 
The F i rst  par t  of  the ru le  accounts For the d i f fe rence between (42a) 
and (42b-c) ,  the second par t  is needed to exp la in  why (39b) estab-  
l i shes  a permanent  re ferent  only under one of  the two possible in ter -  
p re ta t ions .  Not ice that,  in (42a), the quant i f ie r  under ly ing the NP 
a museum is attached to the main  propos i t ion .  Since the main  
propos i t ion  i s  asser ted to be t rue  and there  are  no h igher  quant i f ie rs  
involved,  (2~2a) estab l i shes  a re ferent  cor respond ing  to the NP a 
museum.  Now, cons ider  the o ther  two in terpreta t ions  o f  (40). The 
verb  intend is one of the modal  verbs  discussed in (1 .21) .  We know 
that  the complement  of  a modal  verb  taken by i t se l f  is  not imp l ied  or  
presupposed to be t rue .  In (42b) and (42c), the quant i f ie r  under ly ing 
the NP a museum is  attached to the complement .  Therefore~ the 
above ru le  cor rec t ly  p red ic ts  that  no re ferent  cor respond ing  to a 
m 
museum is establ ished under these two in terpreta t ions .  
F rom the point of  v iew of a text  in terpret ing  device,  the c lass i -  
cal theory  has t i t t le  to recommend i t se l f .  The prob lems studied above 
c lear ly  argue in Favor of the Bach-McOawtey  f ramework ,  in p roces -  
sing a sentence, a text interpreter apparently has  to associate an 
indefinite NP  with a variable and attach the binding quantifier to some 
sentence above the NP  using whatever  clues there are present to 
- 30 -  
ass ign  the scope wi th  as l i t t le  ambigu i ty  as poss ib le .  Clues that  
reduce scope ambigu i ty  include the presence of an appos i t ive re la t ive  
clause or of special words  such as "certain"~ "single"~ and "some"  
in the noun phrase i t se l f  and the sur face  order  of  quant i f iers~ nega- 
t ion ,  and ar t i c les  in the res t  o f  the sentence.  Secondly~ the in ter -  
p re ter  has to keep t rack  of the t ru th  value o f  the propos i t ion  repre -  
sented by the sentence to which  the quant i f ie r  is  attached.  The 
fo l low ing  example  demonst ra tes  some o f  the diFFiculties that  are  
invo lved .  Let  us s ta r t  a d i scourse  w i th  (43). 
(43) Mary may want  to  mammy a Swede.  
H igh ly  schemat ica l ty~ the under ly ing  s t ruc ture  o f  (48) is someth ing 
l i ke  (44).  
(44) 
NP VP  
I I ~ may

J The quant i f ie r  that  binds the var iab le  under ly ing  the NP a Swede 
may belong to any of  the three  sentences,  S l ,  S 2, and $3,  which 
causes (43) to  be ambiguous  at leas t  in the fo l low ing  three  ways .  
/ 
- 31  - 
(45) (a) 'There  is  some Swede whom Mary  may want  to  
marry .  ' 
(b) ' I t  may  be the case that  there  i s  some Swede whom 
Mary  wants  to  marry ,  ' 
(c) 'It may  be the case that Mary  wants her future 
husband to be a Swede.  ' 
Of the three sentences involved, only S l is asserted by the speaker 
to  be a t rue  propos i t ion .  The  two o ther  sentences ,  S 2 and S8,  a re  
both commanded by a modal  verb  (may and want) ,  there fore ,  their" 
t ru th  is  not imp l ied  or  p resupposed .  The indef in i te  NP  a Swede 
es tab l i shes  a d i scourse  re ferent  jus t  in case i t s  b ind ing quant i f ie r  i s  
a t tached to  S 1" Th is  can be demonst ra ted  eas i ly  by po in t ing  out that ,  
i f  the speaker  cont inues  the d i scourse  w i th  (46),  the preced ing  sentence 
(48) can on ly  be unders tood  in the sense o f  (4.5a). 
(46) She in t roduced h im to  her  mother  yes terday .  
However ,  the fo l low ing  cont inuat ion ,  .where  the pronoun its' s tands  for" 
$2 ,  permi ts  both (4,5a) and (45b).  
(47) Suppose that  i t  i s  tr`ue, then she w i l l  cer ta in ly  in t roduce  
h im to her  mother .  
As  a f ina l  example ,  a f te r  some thought  i t  shou ld  be obv ious  that  a 
d i soourse  cons is t ing  o f  (48) and (48)~ where  the f i r s t  \ [ t  in (48) s tands  
fo r  S 2 and the second {.t fop S 8 i s  th ree  ways  ambiguous  jus t  as  (48) 
- 3 Z -  
by i t se l f .  S ince  a l l  th ree  component  propos i t ions  of  (44) a re  now 
e i ther  asser ted  or  supposed to  be t rue ,  there  i s  no way  o f  reso lv ing  
the inherent  scope ambigu i ty  by look ing  at  the  coPefePent ia l i ty  o f  a 
Swede and h im.  
(48) Suppose  that  i t  i s  t rue  and that  she does i t ,  then  she 
w i l l  cer ta in ly  in t roduce  h im to  her  mother .  
A l though the argument  aga ins t  the t rad i t iona l  fea?ure  \ [ -+spec i f i c \ ]  
shou ld  leave  no doubt  about  i t s  use lessness  in d i scuss ing  anyth ing  but 
the s imples t  k ind o f  scope ambigu i ty ,  i t  does not necessar i l y  mean 
that  the fami l ia r  te rms ' spec i f i c '  and 'non-spec i f i c '  shou ld  be 
re jec ted .  They  have proved  quite use fu l  and no harm i s  done, p ro -  
v ided  that  they  are  unders tood  in a re la t ive  sense and not as  denot ing 
some abso lu te  proper ty  inherent  in indef in i te  noun phrases .  For  
example ,  cons ider  in terpretat ion  (45b) of  (4.3), wh ich  ass igns  the 
quant i f ie r  to  S 2 ? One might  ,want to  say  that ,  w i th  respect  to  the 
verb  want  the indef in i te  NP  a Swede is  spec i f i c .  On the o ther  hand,  
i f  the quant i f ie r  i s  a t tached to  $3 ,  as  in (45c),  a Swede cou ld  be ca l led  
non-spec i f i c  w i th  respect  to  want .  In genera l ' ,  le t  us ca l l  an indef in i te  
NP  spec i f i c  w i th  respect  to  a g iven  verb  (o r  quant i f ie r ,  o r  negat ion)  i f  
the la t te r  i s  in the scope o f  the quant i f ie r  assoc ia ted  w i th  the NP.  It  
i s  non-spec i f i c  in case the  verb  commands  the quant i f ie r .  Th is  k ind  
o f  de f in i t ion  seems cons is tent  w i th  the way  these  te rms have been used 
- 33  - 
in  recent  l i te ra ture ,  and there  is  no reason  to  s top  us ing  them as  
tong as  the  re la t ive  nature  o f  spec i f i c i ty  i s  unders tood .  
3. Summary  
It i s  t ime to  rev iew the s i tuat ion .  We s tar ted  by  ask ing  the 
seeming ly  na |be  quest ion :  "When i s  there  supposed  to  be an ind iv idua l  
assoc ia ted  w i th  an indef in i te  noun phrase?"  Na|k/e as  i t  may  be, i t  
must  be answered  in case  there  is  ever  go ing  to  be a dev ice  fo r  in ter - -  
p re t ing  wr i t ten  texts  o r  everyday  conversat ion  w i th  anyth ing  approach-  
ing human soph is t i ca t ion .  There  i s  a l so  another  reason  to  be 
in teres ted  in the  sub jec t .  F rom a l ingu is t i c  po in t  o f  v iew,  i t  i s  a 
p rob lem o f  core ference  const ra in ts  o f  a somewhat  d i f fe rent  k ind  than  
those  s tud ied  under  the  labe l  ' P ronomina l i za t ion ' .  The  present  type  o f  
const ra in ts  a re  even  more  bas ic .  I t  wou ld  seem that  the quest ion  
whether  two  noun phrases  can be core ferent ia l  at  a l l  must  p recede  the 
quest ion  whether  a pronoun-antecedent  re la t ion  may ho ld  between them.  
Second ly ,  i f  re la t ive  c lauses  are  der ived  t rans format iona l ly  f rom con-  
jo ined  sentences  by  'Retat iv i za t ion ' ,  as  many l ingu is ts  be l ieve ,  the 
const ra in ts  d i scussed  here  are  a l so  a prerequ is i te  For that  t rans forma-  
t ion .  For  these  reasons~ the  prob lems s tud ied  in th i s  paper  a re  o f  
some theoret i ca l  in teres t  qu i te  independent ly  f rom whether  the  resu l t s  
lead  to  any  pract i ca l  app l i ca t ions .  
- 3 4 -  
We found that ,  in s imp le  sentences that  do not contain cer ta in  
quant i f ie r - l i ke  express ions ,  an indef in i te  NP estab l i shes  a d iscourse  
re ferent  just  in case the sentence is an a f f i rmat ive  asser t ion .  By  
'es tab l i shes  a d i scourse  re ferent '  we meant  that  there  may be a 
core ferent ia t  pronoun or  def in i te  noun phrase ta ter  in the d i scourse ,  
indef in i te  NPs  in Yes -No  quest ions and commands  do not estab l ish  
re fe  rents .  
In studying more  compl i ca ted  examples ,  i t  was found neces-  
saP) / to  rep lace  Chomsky 's  in teger - type  re ferent ia l  ind ices  by bound 
var iab les .  In th i s  f rarnework~ the t rad i t iona l  p rob lem of  spec i f i c i ty  
is t reated  as scope ambigu i ty .  We studied severa l  types of  verbs  
that  take complements  and the i r  semant ic  p roper t ies .  We concluded 
that~ in general~ an indef in i te  NP es tab l i shes  a permanent  d iscourse  
re ferent  jus t  in case the quant \ [ f ie r  assoc iated w i th  i t  is  attached to a 
sentence that  is  asser ted ,  impl ied~ or  presupposed to be t rue  and 
there  ape no h igher  quant i f ie rs  invo lved .  
There  ape a couple of  spec ia l  p rob lems:  'o ther  wor lds '  and 
shor t  te rm re ferents .  A l though d iscourse  re ferents  o rd inar i l y  ex i s t  
fo r  the speaker~ there  is  a c lass  of  fworid--cr@ating t verbs~ such as 
be l ieve r that  a lso es tab l i sh  PefePents o f  another  kind. These ex is t  
fop somebody  else~ not necessar i l y  fo r  the speaker .  ThePefoPe~ we 
need to  d is t ingu ish  between the speaker ts  wor ld  and o ther  rea lms  
- 35 -  
and  al low fo r  the poss ib i l i ty  that  they are  not populated by the same 
ind iv iduals .  Secondly,  there  are  shor t  te rm re ferents ,  whose l i fe -  
span may be extended by cont inuing the d iscourse  in the proper  mode.  
What th is  p roper  mode is depends on the c i rcumstances .  FoP 
example ,  every  success ive sentence may have to contain ( i)  a modal  
as the main  verb ,  ( i i )  a quant i f ie r  of  a cer ta in  type,  or" ( i i i )  be in the 
counter factua l  mood.  That  is,  i t  is  poss ib le to e laborate  for" a~vhite 
on s i tuat ions  that  are  known not to obtain o r  that  may or  should 
obtain and d iscuss what  somet imes  or  a lways  is  the case.

3 What  remains  unexpla ined here  is  the fac t  (pointed out to me by 
John Olney)  that  must  in (27) has two  mean ings  depending on the 
spec i f i c i ty  o f  the NP  a r i ch  man in the preced ing sentence.  I f  the 
f i r s t  sentence i s  about a spec i f i c  man,  then must  in the second 
sentence is  in terpreted  in a ra ther  weak  sense: ' I t  is  l i ke ly  that  he is  
a banker ' .  But  t f  the NP a r i ch  man is non-spec i f i c ,  the  second 
sentence means:  ' I t  i s  necessary  that  he be a banker ' .  
4 George Lakof f  ( fo r thcoming)  has suggested that  quant i f iePs and 
negat ion  be ana lyzed as verbs  (p red icates )  instead o f  g iv ing them a 
special status, as is usually done in symbolic logic. It is yet unclear 
to me whether  there is any st,,bsta,.-tive issue involved or whether he 
i s  only propos ing  another  no~- ' _  .-,. 
5 There  are other good aPgurr~nics against the feature \[ *_ specific\] in 
Janet  Dean 1968. Unfor tunate ly ,  they  did not persuade the author  
herse l f .  
6 The  complement  of intend is what  W.  V. O. Quine calls 'opaque 
context'. \] ignore here his view that one should not be permitted to 
quantify into such a context. It seems to me that the objections he 
raises have to do with the double Pole names  play in such contexts 
and only call fop moPe sophisticated linguistic analysis. Notice that 
Qu~ne approves  o f  ( i )  wh i le  re jec t ing  ( i i )  as mean ing less  '(Quine 1960, ? 
p. 166): 
( i )  (~x) (Tom be l ieves  x to  have denounced Cat i l ine )  
( i t )  (~x) (Tom be l ieves  that  x denounced Oat i l ine )  
From a linguistic point of view, however, there is nothing but a 
superficial differenoe between (i) and (ii) due to 'Subject raising' that 
l~s applied in (i) but not in (ii). 
7 By  'higher" quant i f ie r "  I mean quant i f te r ' s  such as al.._.t, each,  many,  
and few,  in fac t ,  everyth ing  except  the quant i f ier"  assoc ia ted  Mth  the

d i s t inc t ion  i s  the fac t  that ,  i f  there  are  two indef in i te  s ingu lar  NPs  in 
the same sentence ,  both es tab l i sh  a re ferent  no mat ter  what  their"
