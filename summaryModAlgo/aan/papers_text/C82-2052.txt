This paper descr ibes  a new parser  that  combines top 
down and bottom up s t ra teg ies  and the natura l  language pro-  
cess in6  system PET which uses the  parser .  PET i s  des lgned to

Most extant  natura l  language process ing  systems have 
very  compl icated  cont ro l  s t ruc tures  and are ,  there fore ,  
d i f f i cu l t  to  extend modu lar ly .  I t  appears that  the lack  of  
modu lar i ty  of  these  systems i s  due to the fac t  that  the i r  
syntact i c  exper t i se  i s  not -oonven?ehtly located  in  one rout -  
ine  but ,  in  e f fec t ,  d i s t r ibuted  throughout  he ent i re  p ro~am.

The parser  i s  descr ibed  and cont ras ted  w i th  severa l  
other TD and BU parsers. 
The most notable features of the operation of the par- 
ser are the follov~ng, As the sentence is traversed from left 
to right, TD expectations are  associated with each position 
in the sentence. Each word in the sentence is thought of as 
lylnE between a beginnlng and an ending position, so that the 
i-th word lies between positions i-I and i, Nodes are built 
only when they agree with prior expectations and when they 
meet additional context-sensitive tests. 
At each moment, the parser attempts to keep the forest 
of partial trees as shallow as possible. After the input words 
have been processed from left to right, the roots of the 
trees constructed so far are visited in alternating right to 
left and left to right order. With each pass the height of 
some trees in the parse forest increases until the root for 
the entire sentence is built.
