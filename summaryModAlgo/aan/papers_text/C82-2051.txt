This paper presents  a conceptua l  taxonomy of Japanese 
ad jec t ives ,  succeeding that  on Japanese verbs ' .  In  th i s  taxo-  
n~ny, natura l  language i s  assoc ia ted  with rea l  world th ings  - 
- mat ter ,  events ,  a t t r ibutes  - and menta l  ac t iv i t ies  - sp i r i t -  
ual  and sensua l .  Ad ject ive  concepts are d iv ided in to  two 
large c lasses ,  s imple and non-s imple .  Simple concepts cannot 
be reduced in to  fu r ther  e lementary ad jec t ive  concepts ,  whereas 
non-s imple ones can be. Roughly speaking,  s imple concepts are 
concrete  and can be d i rec t ly  assoc ia ted  wi th  phys ica l  and 
menta l  a t t r ibutes ,  whereas non-s imple ones are abst rac t  and in -  
d i rec t ly  assoc ia ted  with them. 
2. Simple Ad ject ive  Concepts 
Verb concepts  were we l l  understood as "change" f ro~ s ta te  
S O to state S 1 as shown in Fig. 14 Adjective concepts are con- 
sidered to be captured as the "d i f fe rence"  between ob jec ts  O O 
and 0 I. Ylg.2 shows how the difference in vertical length be- 
tween 00 and 01 br ings  about the concept of "h igh".  Notice 
that  sur face  s t ruc tures  o f ten  lack the express ion  of 00 l i ke  
"yama-ga taka i  (the mountain i s  h igh)" .  Since the meaning of 
"high" cannot be expressed only by O 1, deep s t ruc tures  need 
O 0 as an object for comparison.

2.1  St ructura l  Pat te rns  
Ad jec t ive  concepts  can be regarded as the concept  of  a 
re la t ion  among const i tuents  which produce d i f fe rence  and can 
be represented  as fo l lows :  
Ad(C, e, o, of, Or, o m, os, i, l, t, r, ...) (1) 
where each symbol in  parentheses  tands fo r  a const i tuent .  For  
example, c and s s tand fo r  an ob jec t  fo r  ccmpar l lon  and a sub- 
~ect ,  respect ive ly .  Scae const i tuents  are  ob l igatory  in  the 
sense that  they  are ind ispensab le  in  the recogn i t ion  of  d i f fe r -  
ence.  Seven types of  s t ruc tura l  pat te rns  are proposed,  accord -  
ing to  the combinat ion of  ob l igatory  const i tuents .  
2.2 Semantic Contents  
The semantic contents  of  Ad in  formula (1) are categor i z~ 
ed in to  phys ica l ,  menta l  and abst rac t  a t t r ibute .  We c lass i fy  
each of  them in  deta i l  because we cannot detect  aDy d i f fe rence

without  such in fo rmat ion .  In  the case of verbs ,  twenty cate -  
gor ies  such as d isp lacement ,  de fo~nst ion ,  and sp i r i tua l  ac t -  
i v i ty  were proposed to c lass i fy  the semantic contents  of 
"changes".  We modify them e l ight ly  to apply to the c lass i f i c -  
a t ion  of semantic contente  of ad jec t ives .  For example, d ie -  
placement and deformat ion are modi f ied to locat ion  and shape, 
respect ive ly .  
3. Non-Simple Ad jec t ive  Concepte 
Non-simple ad jec t ive  concepts are not d i rec t ly  assoc ia t -  
ed wi th  p~e isa l  or menta l  a t t r ibutee~ there fore  we emphasize 
an ana lys i s  of how they ere composed of s imple ones.  
3.1 Complex Concepts-A 
For example, there  i s  a complex ad jec t ive  "hoso-nagai  
( th in - long)"  which i s  reg is tered  as one word in  o rd inary  
Japanese d ic t ionar ies .  The conne0t i  ~ re la t ion  between two 
ad jec t ive  concepts i s  a log ica l  product in  th i s  case.  The 
complex concept of A i s  def ined ss fo l lows :  i f  two ad jec t ive  
concepts are connected by a ru le  and the connected concept i s  
represented  by a complex word of those ad jec t ives ,  i t  i s  ca l l -  
ed a "complex concept of A". Two types of connect ing  ru les  
are proposed: log ica l  product  and syntact i c  re la t ion .  
3.2 Complex Concepts-B 
This concept i s  usua l ly  represented  by a s imple word and 
i s  cons idered to cons is t  of severa l  e lementary  ad jec t ive  con-  
cepts .  No genera l  ru le  can be found to connect  e lementary  ad- 
Jec t ive  concepts .  Semantic contents  of the concepts are c lass -  
i f i ed  in to  such categor ies  as l ingu is t i c  ac t iv?ty  and character .  
3.3 Der ivat ive  Concepts 
Some concepts possess e funct ion  of der iv ing  s new con-  
cept by operat i~  o thers .  They have two morphemic s t rUct t t res ,  
p re f ix  ~ and ett~fix, which add cer ta in  i~ormet ion  to operands.  
For example, st~ffix " - ta rash~"  adds the meaning " indeed" to 
i t s  operand. Such der ivat ive  in fo rmat ion  i s  ca tegor i zed  in to  
five classes.

4. Classification 
There are approximately 530 adjectives considered suffic- 
ient for daily Japanese. We actually classified their con- 
cepts, n~nbering about 630, according to types and categories 
proposed in Sec.2 and 3. They were well classified into those 
types and categories. In the classification of simple concepts, 
"standardconcepte" were chosen from among similar concepts, 
amounting to approximately 270. They might be considered 
"primitives" in the sense that every other adjective concept 
can be derived from them by some rule. 
5. Ext rac t ion  of  Conceptua l  Features  
We ext ract  conceptua l  features  from each A d and i t s

6. Sentence Production from Picture Patterns 
System SUPP, which accepts moving picture patterns, in- 
terprets the meaning of changes in them, infers about simil- 
arity among changes, end describes the results in Japanese 
and English sentences, was constructed as an application of 
- 212  - 
the  conceptua l  taxonomy of verbs .  SUPPwas improved to  in ter -  
p re t  phys ica l  a t t r ibutes  of p io tnre  pat terns .  Four teen  s tan-  
dard concepts  were chosen fo r  th i s  improvement.  An example of
