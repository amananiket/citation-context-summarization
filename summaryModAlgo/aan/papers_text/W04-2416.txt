Abstract
In this paper, we present a semantic role la-
beler (or chunker) that groups syntactic chunks
(i.e. base phrases) into the arguments of a pred-
icate. This is accomplished by casting the se-
mantic labeling as the classification of syntactic
chunks (e.g. NP-chunk, PP-chunk) into one of
several classes such as the beginning of an ar-
gument (B-ARG), inside an argument (I-ARG)
and outside an argument (O). This amounts to
tagging syntactic chunks with semantic labels
using the IOB representation. The chunker is
realized using support vector machines as one-
versus-all classifiers. We describe the represen-
tation of data and information used to accom-
plish the task. We participate in the ?closed
challenge? of the CoNLL-2004 shared task and
report results on both development and test
sets.
1 Introduction
In semantic role labeling the goal is to group sequences
of words together and classify them by using semantic la-
bels. For meaning representation the predicate-argument
structure that exists in most languages is used. In this
structure a word (most frequently a verb) is specified as
a predicate, and a number of word groups are considered
as arguments accompanying the word (or predicate).
In this paper, we select support vector machines
(SVMs) (Vapnik, 1995; Burges, 1998) to implement
the semantic role classifiers, due to their ability to han-
dle an extremely large number of (overlapping) features
with quite strong generalization properties. Support vec-
tor machines for semantic role chunking were first used
?This research was partially supported by the ARDA
AQUAINT program via contract OCG4423B and by the NSF
via grant IIS-9978025
in (Hacioglu and Ward, 2003) as word-by-word (W-by-
W) classifiers. The system was then applied to the
constituent-by-constituent (C-by-C) classification in (Ha-
cioglu et al, 2003). In (Pradhan et al, 2003; Prad-
han et al, 2004), several extensions to the basic system
have been proposed, extensively studied and systemati-
cally compared to other systems. In this paper, we imple-
ment a system that classifies syntactic chunks (i.e. base
phrases) instead of words or the constituents derived from
syntactic trees. This system is referred to as the phrase-
by-phrase (P-by-P) semantic role classifier. We partici-
pate in the ?closed challenge? of the CoNLL-2004 shared
task and report results on both development and test sets.
A detailed description of the task, data and related work
can be found in (Carreras and Ma`rquez, 2004).
2 System Description
2.1 Data Representation
In this paper, we change the representation of the original
data as follows:
? Bracketed representation of roles is converted into
IOB2 representation (Ramhsaw and Marcus, 1995;
Sang and Veenstra, 1995)
? Word tokens are collapsed into base phrase (BP) to-
kens.
Since the semantic annotation in the PropBank corpus
does not have any embedded structure there is no loss of
information in the first change. However, this results in
a simpler representation with a reduced set of tagging la-
bels. In the second change, it is possible to miss some
information in cases where the semantic chunks do not
align with the sequence of BPs. However, in Section 3.2
we show that the loss in performance due to the misalign-
ment is much less than the gain in performance that can
be achieved by the change in representation.

Figure 1: Illustration of change in data representation; (a) original word-by-word data representation (b) phrase-by-
phrase data representation used in this paper. Words are collapsed into base phrase types retaining only headwords
with their respective features. Bracketed representation of semantic role labels is converted into IOB2 representation.
See text for details.
The new representation is illustrated in Figure 1 along
with the original representation. Comparing both we note
the following differences and advantages in the new rep-
resentation:
? BPs are being classified instead of words.
? Only the BP headwords (rightmost words) are re-
tained as word information.
? The number of tagging steps is smaller.
? A fixed context spans a larger segment of a sentence.
Therefore, the P-by-P semantic role chunker classifies
larger units, ignores some of the words, uses a relatively
larger context for a given window size and performs the
labeling faster.
2.2 Features
The following features, which we refer to as the base fea-
tures, are provided in the shared task data for each sen-
tence;
? Words
? Predicate lemmas
? Part of Speech tags
? BP Positions: The position of a token in a BP using
the IOB2 representation (e.g. B-NP, I-NP, O etc.)
? Clause tags: The tags that mark token positions in a
sentence with respect to clauses. (e.g *S)*S) marks
a position that two clauses end)
? Named entities: The IOB tags of named entities.
There are four categories; LOC, ORG, PERSON
and MISC.
Using available information we have created the fol-
lowing token level features:
? Token Position: The position of the phrase with re-
spect to the predicate. It has three values as ?be-
fore?, ?after? and ?-? for the predicate.
? Path: It defines a flat path between the token and
the predicate as a chain of base phrases. At both
ends, the chain is terminated with the POS tags of
the predicate and the headword of the token.
? Clause bracket patterns: We use two patterns of
clauses for each token. One is the clause bracket
chain between the token and the predicate, and the
other is from the token to sentence begin or end de-
pending on token?s position with respect to the pred-
icate.
? Clause Position: a binary feature that indicates the
token is inside or outside of the clause which con-
tains the predicate
? Headword suffixes: suffixes of headwords of length
2, 3 and 4.
? Distance: we have two notions of distance; the first
is the distance of the token from the predicate as a
number of base phrases, and the second is the same
distance as the number of VP chunks.
? Length: the number of words in a token.
We also use some sentence level features:
? Predicate POS tag: the part of speech category of
the predicate
? Predicate Frequency; this is a feature which indi-
cates whether the predicate is frequent or rare with
respect to the training set. The threshold on the
counts is currently set to 3.
? Predicate BP Context : The chain of BPs centered
at the predicate within a window of size -2/+2.
? Predicate POS Context : The POS tags of the
words that immediately precede and follow the pred-
icate. The POS tag of a preposition is replaced with
the preposition itself.
? Predicate Argument Frames: We used the left and
right patterns of the core arguments (A0 through A5)
for each predicate . We used the three most frequent
argument frames for both sides depending on the po-
sition of the token in focus with respect to the pred-
icate. (e.g. raise has A0 and A1 AO (A0 being the
most frequent) as its left argument frames, and A1,
A1 A2 and A2 as the three most frequent right argu-
ment frames)
? Number of predicates: This is the number of pred-
icates in the sentence.
For each token (base phrase) to be tagged, a set of or-
dered features is created from a fixed size context that
surrounds each token. In addition to the above features,
we also use previous semantic IOB tags that have already
been assigned to the tokens contained in the context. A
5-token sliding window is used for the context. A greedy
left-to-right tagging is performed.
All of the above features are designed to implicitly cap-
ture the patterns of sentence constructs with respect to
different word/predicate usages and senses. We acknowl-
edge that they significantly overlap and extensive exper-
iments are required to determine the impact of each fea-
ture on the performance.
2.3 Classifier
All SVM classifiers were realized using TinySVM1 with
a polynomial kernel of degree 2 and the general purpose
SVM based chunker YamCha 2. SVMs were trained for
begin (B) and inside (I) classes of all arguments and one
outside (O) class for a total of 78 one-vs-all classifiers
(some arguments do not have an I-tag).

3 Experimental Results
3.1 Data and Evaluation Metrics
The data provided for the shared task is a part of the
February 2004 release of the PropBank corpus. It con-
sists of sections from the Wall Street Journal part of the
Penn Treebank. All experiments were carried out using
Sections 15-18 for training Section-20 for development
and Section-21 for testing. The results were evaluated for
precision, recall and F?=1 numbers using the srl-eval.pl
script provided by the shared task organizers.
3.2 W-by-W and P-by-P Experiments
In these experiments we used only the base features to
compare the two approaches. Table 1 illustrates the over-
all performance on the dev set. Although both systems
were trained using the same number of sentences, the ac-
tual number of training examples in each case were quite
different. Those numbers are presented in Table 2. It is
clear that P-by-P method uses much less data for the same
number of sentences. Despite this we particularly note a
considerable improvement in recall. Actually, the data
reduction was not without a cost. Some arguments have
been missed as they do not align with the base phrase
chunks due to inconsistencies in semantic annotation and
due to errors in automatic base phrase chunking. The per-
centage of this misalignment was around 2.5% (over the
dev set). We observed that nearly 45% of the mismatches
were for the ?outside? chunks. Therefore, sequences of
words with outside tags were not collapsed.
3.3 Best System Results
In these experiments all of the features described earlier
were used with the P-by-P system. Table 3 presents our
best system performance on the development set. Ad-
ditional features have improved the performance from
61.02 to 71.72. The performance of the same system on
the test set is similarly illustrated in Table 4.

4 Conclusions
We have described a semantic role chunker using SVMs.
The chunking method has been based on a chunked sen-
tence structure at both syntactic and semantic levels. We
have jointly performed semantic chunk segmentation and
labeling using a set of one-vs-all SVM classifiers on a
phrase-by-phrase basis. It has been argued that the new
representation has several advantages as compared to the
original representation. It yields a semantic role labeler
that classifies larger units, exploits relatively larger con-
text, uses less data (possibly, redundant and noisy data
are filtered out), runs faster and performs better.
