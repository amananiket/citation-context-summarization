Abstract 
The paper presents a constraint based semantic 
formalism for HPSG. The syntax-semantics inter- 
face directly implements yntactic conditions on 
quantifier scoping and distributivity. 1 The con- 
struction of semantic representations is guided" by 
general principles governing the interaction bet- 
ween syntax and semantics. Each of these princip- 
les acts as a constraint o narrow down the set 
of possible interpretations of a sentence. Meanings 
of ambiguous entences are represented by single 
partial representations ( o-called U(nderspecified) 
D(iscourse) R(epresentation) S(tructure)s) to which 
further constraints can be added monotonically to 
gain more information about the content of a sent- 
ence. There is no need to build up a large number 
of alternative representations of the sentence which 
are then filtered by subsequent discourse and world 
knowledge. The advantage of UDRSs is not only that 
they allow for monotonic incremental interpretation 
but also that they are equipped with truth condi- 
tions and a proof theory that allows for inferences 
to be drawn directly on structures where quantifier 
scope is not resolved. 
1 Introduction 
The semantic analysis of standard HPSG deviates 
from the familiar Montegovian way to construct se- 
mantic representations mainly in that it uses unifica- 
tion to eliminate the need for 13-reduction. Variables 
1In the present paper we do only focus on simple 
principles restricting scope ambiguities and ambiguities 
resulting from plural NPs in English. For German re- 
strictions on scope are much more complicated because 
they cannot be stated independently of scrambling phe- 
nomena. In (l~-ank/Reyle 1994) the present approach is 
worked out for a fragment of German that deals with 
(i) quantifier scope ambiguities triggered by scrambling 
and/or movement and (ii) ambiguities that arise from 
the collective/distributive distinction of plural NPs. The 
underlying scope theory for German was developed in 
(Frey 1993). The analysis in (Frank/Reyle 1994) departs 
significantly from our earlier account in (Frank/Reyle 
1992), where monotonicity was not ensured.

are bound to argument positions by the close inter- 
play between syntactic and semantic processing; and 
the semantics of constituents i determined by the 
Semantics Principle, which governs the way of unify- 
ing the semantics of daughter constituents to build 
up the semantic value of the phrasal constituent: 
The CONTENT value is projected from the seman- 
tic head, which is defined as the syntactic HEAD- 
DTR in head-comp-structures, but as the ADJ-DTR 
in head-adjunct structures. It is important o note 
that the semantic ontribution of quantified verb ar- 
guments is not completely projected as part of the 
CONTENT value. The meaning of such NPs splits 
into the features QUANTS, a list representing the 
information about quantifier scope, and NUCLEUS, 
containing the nonquantificational core. In the ge- 
neral case only the NUCLEUS is projected from the 
semantic head according to the Semantics Principle, 
while the QUANTS value gets instantiated stepwisc 
in interaction with the quantifier storage mechanism 
(Cooper Store). The mechanism of Cooper storage 
is built into HPSG by use of two further attributes, 
QSTORE and RETRIEVED, both represented assets 
of quantifiers. All quantifiers tart out in QSTORE 
by lexical definition. The Semantics Principle defines 
the inheritance of QSTORE to the phrasal constitu- 
ents, where they may be taken out of store by an 
appropriately instantiated RETRIEVED value and 
then put into the QUANTS value of the CONTENT 
feature. The order in which the semantic value of 
quantified NPs is retrieved fixes their relative scope. 
To analyse sentences with scope ambiguities everal 
parses are thus necessary. Besides the definition of 
appropriate restrictions to and configurations for ap- 
plications of RETRIEVED the main problem we face 
with this kind of analysis is to modify the semantics 
of HPSG in such a way that it yields underspecificd 
representations and not sets of fully specified ones. 
Further shortcomings ofHPSG semantics are the fol- 
lowing. First, adjuncts (like quantificationai dverbs, 
modals) and also negation bear the potential to in- 
troduce scope ambiguities. In order to treat them 
by the same mechanism that treats the arguments 
of the verb their meaning representation would ha- 
ve to be put into store. This, however, requires fur- 
ther modifications of the Semantics Principle, bec- 
ause the treatment of head-adjunct s ructures differs 
essentially from the treatment of other configurati- 
ons (see (Pollard/Sag 1994), Ch.8). 2 Second, the- 
re is no underspecified representation f ambiguities 
that arise from the distributive/collective distinction 
of plural NPs (neither within the'HPSG framework 
nor in the C(ore)L(anguage)E(ngine)3). Third, the 
semantic representation of indefinite NPs must be 
independent of the context in which they are in- 
terpreted. We do not want to switch from a uni- 
versally quantified interpretation to an existentially 
quantified one, when we come to disambiguate the 
ambiguous entence Every  s tudent  who admires  
a ph i losopher  eads  his or ig inal  wr i t ings  such 
that a ph i losopher  is interpreted specifically. This 
requirement calls for DRT as underlying semantic 
formalism. 
In the sequel of this paper we show how the extensi- 
on of DRT to UDRT developed in (Reyle 1993) can 
be combined with an HPSG-style grammar. The ba- 
sic idea of the combination being that syntax as well 
as semantics provide structures of equal right; that 
the principles internal to the syntactic and seman- 
tic level are motivated only by the syntactic and se- 
mantic theory, respectively; and that mutually cons- 
training relations between syntax and semantics are 
governed by a separate set of principles that rela- 
te syntactic and semantic information appropriately. 
We will replace the Semantics Principle of standard 
HPSG versions by a principle which directly reflects 
the monotonicity underlying the interpretation pro- 
cess designed in (Reyle 1993): At any stage of the 
derivation more details are added to the description 
of the semantic relations between the various com- 
ponents of the sentence, i.e. the partial representa- 
tion of any mother node is the union of the parti- 
al representations of its daughter nodes plus further 
constraints derived from the syntactic, semantic and 
also pragmatic ontext. 
2 Quantifier Scope and Partial Orders 
The need for underspecified representations is by 
now widely accepted within computational nd theo- 
retical linguistics. 4 To make the results of the 
ongoing research on underspecified representations 
available for HPSG we may pursue two strategies. 
According to the first strategy we take the HPSG- 
style analysis - essentially as it is - and only ap- 
2For general criticism of the analysis of adjuncts in 
standard HPSG see (Abb/Maienborn 1994). Their ana- 
lysis of adjuncts in HPSG fits neatly into the account of 
semantics projection to be presented below. 
3See (Alshawi 1992). In CLE the:resolution of QLFs 
also involves disambiguation with respect o this kind of 
ambiguities. 
4See (Peters/vanDeemter 1995) for recent discussion. 
ply slight modifications to produce underspecified 
output. The second strategy involves a more radical 
change as it takes an existing theory of underspeci- 
fled representations and replaces the HPSG seman- 
tics by the construction principles of this theory. 
Let us start out with a sketch of the first approach. 
It will show us where its limitations are and allow 
us to compare different approaches to underspeci- 
fication. The first thing to do, when un-specifying 
HPSG semantics, is to relax the retrieval operati- 
on. This must be done in two respects. First, we 
must allow NP-meanings not to be retrieved at all. 
This results in their relative scope not being deter- 
mined. Second, we must accommodate syntactic and 
semantic restrictions on possible scope relations to 
be stated by the grammar. 5 Restrictions pecifying, 
for example, that the subject NP must always have 
wide scope over the other arguments of the verb; or, 
that the scope of genuinely quantified NPs is clause 
bounded. The modifications we propose are the fol- 
lowing. First, we incorporate the QSTORE feature 
into the CONTENT feature structure. This makes 
the NP meanings available even if they are not re- 
trieved from QSTORE. Second, we take the value of 
the QUANTS feature not to be a "stack" (i.e. by ap- 
pending new retrieved quantifiers as first elements 
to QUANTS), but allow any NP meaning that is re- 
trieved at a later stage to be inserted at any place 
in that list. This means that the order of NP mea- 
nings in QUANTS fixes the relative scope of these 
meanings only; it does not imply that they have 
narrow scope with respect o the NP meaning that 
will be retrieved next. But this is not yet enough 
to implement clause boundedness. The easiest way 
to formulate this restriction is to prohibit projection 
of quantified NP meanings across bounding nodes. 
Thus the QSTORE and QUANTS values of a boun- 
ding node inherit the quantificational information 
only of indefinite NPs and not of generalized quan- 
tifiers. To be more precise, let us consider the tree 
/3 consisting only of the bounding nodes in the syn- 
tactic analysis of a sentence 3". Then the semantic 
content of ~ can be associated with nodes of ~ in 
the following way. For each node i of fl the attribu- 
tes QUANTS, QSTORE and NUCLEUS have values 
quantsi, qstorei and nucleusi. The relative scope 
between scope bearing phrases of ~, i.e. between the 
elements of Ui(quantsiUqstorei) can then be defined 
as follows. 
? If Q1 and Q2 are in quantsi and Q1 precedes 
Q2, then Q1 has scope over Q2. 
? If Qa is in quantsi and Q2 in quantsj, where i
dominates j, then Q1 has scope over Q2. 
? If Q1 is in qstorei and not in qstorej, whe- 
re i dominates j ,  then Qa has scope over 
any Q2 in qstorejUquantsj that are not in 
qstoreiUquantsi. 
5This has to be done also for the standard theory. 
10 
Tim last clause says that any NP Q1 occurring in 
the clause of level i and that is still in QSTORE 
has scope over all quantified NPs Q2 occurring in 
embedded clauses (i.e. clauses of level j) .  But Q1 
does not necessarily have scope over any indefinite 
NP introduced at level j .  
Those familiar with the work of Alshawi and Crouch 
(Alshawi/Crouch 1992) might have noticed the simi- 
larity of their interpretation mechanism and what 
we have achieved by our modifications to standard 
HPSG semantics. The elements of QUANTS play ex- 
actly the same role as the instantiated metavariables 
of Alshawi and Crouch. This means that we could 
adapt their interpretation mechahism to our parti- 
ally scoped CONTENT structures. But note that we 
already have achieved more than they have as we are 
able to express the clause-boundeness re triction for 
generalized quantifiers. 
We will not go into the details and show how the 
truth conditions of Alshawi and Crouch have to be 
modified in order to apply to partially scoped CON- 
TENT structures. We will instead go ahead and work 
out the limitations of what we called the first stra- 
tegy. To keep things as easy as possible we restrict 
ourselves to the case of simple sentences (i.e. to. tri- 
vial tree structures of QSTORE and QUANTS va- 
lues that consist of one single node only). In this 
case the QUANTS value (as well as the instantiati- 
on of metavariables) imposes a partial order on the 
relative scope of quantifiers. Assume we had a sent- 
ence with three quantifiers, Q1, Q2 and Q3. Then 
the possible lenghts of QUANTS values varies from 
0 to 3. Lengths 0 and 1 leave the relative scope of 
Q1, Q2 and Q3 completely underspecified. Values of 
length 2 say that their first element always has wi- 
de scope over the second, leaving all possible choices 
for the third quantifier. And finally we have the fully 
specified scoping relations given by values of length 
3. There are, however, some possibilities to restrict 
scope relationships that cannot be represented this 
way: One cannot, for example, represent the ambi- 
guity that remains if we (or, syntax and semantics) 
require that Q1 and Q2 must have scope over Q3, 
but leaves unspecified the relative scope between Q1 
and Q2; nor are we able to express a restriction that 
says Q1 must have scope over both, Q2 and Q3, while 
leaving the relative scope between Q2 and Q3 un- 
specified. Retrieving a quantifier Qi (or starting to 
calculate the truth value of a sentence by first consi- 
dering this quantifier) is an operation that takes Qi 
and adds it to QUANTS. As QUANTS is a list this 
amounts to a full specification of the relative scope 
of Qi with respect o all other elements already con- 
tained in QUANTS. This shows that the expressive 
power of the representation language is too restricti- 
ve already for simple sentences. We need to represent 
partial orders of quantifier scope. But we cannot do 
this by talking about a pair consisting of a quanti- 
fier Qi and a list of quantifiers QUANTS. We must 
be able to talk about pairs o\] quantifiers. This not 
only increases the expressive power of the represen- 
tation language, it also allows for the formulation of 
restrictions on quantifier scope in a declarative and 
natural way. The formalism of UDRSs we introduce 
in the following section is particularly suited to 'talk' 
about semantic information contributed by diffcrent 
components of a sentence. It therefore provides a 
particularly good ground to implement a principle 
based construction of semantic representations. 
3 UDRS Construct ion in HPSG 
In the following we will design a syntax-semantics n- 
terface for the construction of UDRSes in HPSG, fo- 
cussing on the underspecified representation f scope 
and plural. To overcome the problems discussed in 
Section 2 we chose to depart from the semantics 
used in standard HPSG (Pollard/Sag 1994), and in- 
stead allow for the construction of (U)DRScs. The 
structure of the CONTENT attribute as well as the 
Semantics Principle will be changed substantially, 
since the construction of (U)DRSes allows for inher- 
ently different information structures and processing 
mechanisms. The former CONTENT attribute is re- 
placed by a complex feature structure UDRS, consi- 
sting of three attributes, LS, SUBORD and CONDS. 
I F~s \[L-MAX I,..~\] \]

L g ??~Ds {", . . . .  } J 
CONDS is a set of labelled DRS-conditions, ~i, the 
form of which is determined by lexical entries. SUB- 
ORD contains information about the hierarchical 
structure of a DRS. It is expressed by means of a 
subordination relation, <, between labels. If ")'1 and 
"72 are two DRS-conditions with labels ll and 12 such 
that ll <_ 12 is contained in SUBORD, then this is 
equivalent o saying that ~/1 and ")'2 will occur in 
DRSs/(1 and/(2  such that / (1  is weakly subordina- 
te to / (2 ,  i.e. /(1 is either identical to I(2 or nested 
within it. SUBORD thus imposes the structure of an 
upper semi-lattice with one-element, lT, to the set 
of labels. The attribute LS defines the distinguished 
labels, which indicate the upper and lower bounds 
for a DRS-condition within the semilattice. 
The main task in constructing UDRSes consists 
in appropriately relating the labels of the DRS- 
conditions that are to be combined. This is perfor- 
med by the association of DRS-conditions with di- 
stinguished labels in the lexical entries on the one 
hand and by conditions governing the projection of 
the distinguished labels on the other. The role of the 
distinguished labels is most transparent with verbs 
and quantifiers. 
In the lexical entry of a transitive verb, for example, 
the DRS-condition stated in CONDS is a relation 
11 
holding between discourse referents. 6 This condition 
is associated with an identifying label 1. In addition 
1 is identified as the minimal distinguished label of 
the verbal projection by coindexation with L-MIN.

Generalized quantifiers, as in (3), introduce two new 
labels which identify the DRS-conditions of their re- 
stricter and nuclear scope. The quantificational re- 
lation holding between them is stated in terms of 
the relation attribute, REL. In the lexical entry for 
every, given in (3), a new discourse referent is intro- 
duced, in the restrictor DRS, labelled 111, which is 
identified with the label of the subcategorized NP. 
The feature SUBORD defines the labels of restrictor 
and scope to be subordinate to the label 11 which 
identifies the entire condition. The label 11 is defi- 
ned as the upper bound, or distinguished maximal 
label of the quantificational structure, whereas the 
lower bound, or distinguished minimal label is given 
by the label of the nuclear scope, 112.

The entry for the indefinite singular determiner, (4), 
introduces a new individual type referent. As inde- 
finites do not introduce any hierarchical structure 
into a DRS the identity statement 11 = 112 for the 
minimal and maximal abels is defined in SUBORD.

The construction of UDRSes will be defined in terms 
of clauses of the Semantics Principle: In (5), clau- 
se (I) of the Semantics Principle defines the inhe- 
ritance of the partial DRSes defined in the CONDS 
attributes of the daughters to the CONDS value of 
the phrase. Contrary to the Semantics Principle of 
(Pollard/Sag 1994) the semantic onditions are al- 
ways inherited from both daughters (we assume bi-

nary branching) and therefore project to the upper- 
most sentential level. Furthermore, clause (I) app- 
lies to head-comp- and head-adj-structures in exactly 
the same way. 7 Clause (II) of the Semantics Princi- 
ple defines the inheritance of subordination restric- 
tions: The subordination restrictions of the phrase 
are defined by the union of the SUBORD values of 
the daughters. Clause (Ill) of the Semantics Princi- 
ple states the distinguished labels LS of the phrase to 
be identical to the distinguished labels of the HEAD- 
daughter. It is therefore guaranteed that in binary 
branching structures the minimal and maximal la- 
bels of the head category are available all along the 
(extended) head projection, s This prepares clauses 
(IV) and (V) of the Semantics Principle, which de- 
fine the binding of discourse markers and locality 
of quantificational scope, respectively. We will first 
consider clause (IV) and will come back to clause 
(V) in the next Section. 
In a (U)DRS, the partial structure of the verb has 
to be (weakly) subordinate to the scope of all the 
partial DRSes that introduce the discourse markers 
corresponding to the verb's arguments. This gua- 
rantees that all occurrences of discourse markers are 
properly bound by some superordinated DRS. The 
constraint is realized by clause (IV) of the Semantics 
Principle, the Closed Formula Principle. It guaran- 
tees that the label associated with the verb, which is 
identified with the distinguished minimal abel of the 
sentential projection, is subordinated to the minimal 
label, or lower bound of each of the verb's arguments. 
Note that with quantified arguments the predicate 
of the verb must be subordinate to the nuclear scope 
of the quantifier. As defined in (3), it is in fact the 
nuclear scope of the quantified structure that will 
be accessed by the distinguished minimal label of 
the quantified NP. Thus the Closed Formula Princi- 
ple (IV) in (5) states that in every (non-functional) 
head-comp-struc a further subordination restriction 
is unioned to the phrase's SUBORD value, which 
subordinates the minimal abel of the head -here the 
minimal abel associated with the verb- to the mini- 
mal label of its actual complement, which in case of 
a quantified argument identifies the nuclear scope.

Note that generalized quantifiers were marked as 
scope bearing by non-identical values of minimal and 
maximal labels; and singular indefinite NPs were 
marked as not scope bearing by identifying minimal 
and maximal labels. As plural NPs introduce a quan- 
tificational condition when they are interpreted is- 
tributively but behave like indefinites when interpre- 
ted collectively, in a representation f their meaning 
that is underspecified with respect o the distribu- 
tive/collective ambiguity plural NPs must be mar- 
ked as potentially scope bearing. This can be achie- 
ved if in the lexicon entry of a plural determiner 
(6) we do not completely specify the relation bet- 
ween the minimal label 112 and the maximal abel 
l~, but only require that 112 is weakly subordinate to 
11. This weak subordination relation will be further 
restricted to either identity or strict subordination 
when more information is available from the seman- 
tic or pragmatic ontext hat allows the ambiguity to 
be resolved. By monotonically adding further cons- 
traints a collective or quantificational (distributive 
or generic) reading of the plural NP may then be 
specified, xl If a distributive reading is chosen, the 
minimal label 112 will identify the nuclear scope of 
the quantified structure, and in the case of a coll- 
ective reading the relation of (weak) subordination 
between minimal and maximal abel will be reduced 
to identity. We will state this in detail in Section 4.

Together with the structure of the lexical entries illu- 
strated above, the clauses (I) - (IV) of the Semantics 
Principle given in (5) define the core mechanism for 
UDRS construction: The Semantics Principle defines 
the inheritance of the labelled DRS conditions and of 
the subordination restrictions between these labels, 
which define the semilattice for the complete UDRS 
structure. The subordination restrictions are projec- 
ted from the lexicon or get introdhced monotonical-

comp-structures. For head-subj- and head-adj-structures 
corresponding clauses have to be stated. For head-filler- 
structures we only define inheritance of CONDS, SUB- 
ORD, and LS from the HEAD-DTR.

tions will be unioned to the phrase's SUBORD value by

ly, e.g. by the Closed Formula Principle to ensure 
the correct binding of discourse referents. Further 
subordination restrictions will be added - monoto- 
nically - by the remaining clauses of the Semantics 
Principle, to be introduced in the next Section. 
4 Quantifier Scope and Plural 
Disambiguation 
Quant i f i cat iona l  Scope Since the conditions on 
quantificational scope for generalized quantifiers and 
distributive readings of plural NPs are dependent on 
syntactic structure, the Semantics Principle will be 
supplemented by further clauses governing the in- 
terface between syntactic onstraints and semantic 
representation. Note that genuine quantifiers as well 
as distributive readings of plural NPs differ in their 
scope potential from indefinite NPs and collectivcly 
interpreted plural NPs. Whereas the latter may take 
arbitrarily wide scope, the scope of the former is 
clause bounded, i.e. they are allowed to take scope 
only over elements that appear in their local domain. 
We implement this restriction by requiring that the 
maximal abel of a generalized quantifier be subor- 
dinate to the distinguished label that identifies the 
upper bound of the local domain. For plural NPs, a 
similar constraint must be stated in case a distribu- 
tive reading is chosen which specifies the plural NP 
as scope bearing. 
The distinction between scope bearing and not scope 
bearing NPs was defined by strict subordination and 
identity of the distinguished labels, respectively. In 
case a distributive reading is chosen by the clauses 
for plural disambiguation, to be stated below, the re- 
lation of weak subordination i (6), is strengthened 
to strict subordination. Yet, plural disambiguation 
may take place rather late in subsequent discourse, 
while the syntactic constraints for quantificational 
scope can only be determined locally. The Quanti- 
tier Scope Principle (V) will therefore introduce con- 
ditionalized subordination restrictions to define the 
clause-boundedness of both generalized quantifiers 
and distributively quantified plural NPs. ~2 
For finite sentences the local domain for quantified 
verb arguments comes down to the local IP projec- 
tion (Frey 1993). In a functional HPSG grammar 
(see (Frank 1994)) this local domain corresponds to 
the functional projection of the finite VP. The di- 
stinguished maximal abel lmax which identifies the 
upper bound of the local domain for quantified vcrb 
arguments will therefore be instantiated by the com- 
plementizer heading a finite sentence, as in (7). 
X2The scoping principles described in (Frank/lleyle 
1994) further account for the scope restrictions of ge- 
neralized quantifiers and distributive plural NPs. 
13 
Due to the projection of the distinguished labels by 
clause (III) of the Semantics Principle and the de- 
finition of functional categories, the upper bound 
for the local domain of quantifier scope, lma~, is 
available throughout the extended projection, where 
clause (V) of the Semantics Principle, the Quanti- 
fier Scope Principle, applies. In (8), the Quantifier 
Scope Principle (V) states that if the complement is 
a generalized quantifier (type quant) or a potentially 
scope bearing plural NP (type plura 0 the SUBORD 
value of the phrase will contain a further conditiona- 
lized subordination constraint, which states that - if 
the argument is, or will be characterized as a scope 
bearing argument by strict subordination of its mini- 
mal and maximal abel - the complement's maximal 
label lq~,a,u is subordinate to the label lmax which 
identifies the upper bound of the local domain.

We argued that for an underspecified representation 
of plural NPs as regards the collective/distributive 
ambiguity, their meaning has to be represented by 
potentially scope bearing partial DRSs. This was 
achieved by stating the minimal label of the plural 
NP to be weakly subordinated to its maximal abel 
in (6). Yet, in order to allow for an underspecified 
representation f the example given in (9), the lexi- 
cal entry of the verb, stated in (2), has to be refined 
as indicated in (10).

the corresponding argument place of the verb can- 
not be identified with the group referent introduced 
by the plural NP the lawyers. Instead, the mapping 
between NP meanings and the corresponding argu- 
ment slots of the verb will be defined by a function 
dre\]_res, which returns the value of the appropriate 
discourse referent once a particular plural interpre- 
tation is chosen for (9). 
But as long as the plural ambiguity is unresolved the 
function dre\]_res will be undefined. Thus, if context 
does not provide us with further, disambiguating in- 
formation, (11) will be the final, underspecified re- 
presentation for (9). Here, the function dref_res is 
undefined for the (underspeeified) plural subject NP.

Note that the requirement for an underspecified re- 
presentation of the discourse referent to fill the argu- 
ment place of the verb cannot be implemented by use 
of a type hierarchy or similar devices which come to 
mind straightforwardly. For it is not appropriate for 
the issue of underspecified representations to compu- 
te the set of disjunctive readings, which would ensue 
automatically if we took such an approach. Instead, 
the function dre/_res will be implemented by using 
delaying techniques. The conditions which determi- 
ne the delayed evaluation of the function dre/_res are 
defined in its second argument Cond. As long as the 
variable Cond is not instantiated, the evaluation of 
~dref_res will be blocked, i.e. delayed. 13 
The three clauses of the function dref_res in (12) 
and (13) distinguish between ot scope bearing, scope 
bearing and potentially scope bearing elements.

The first clause of (12), which takes as its first argu- 
ment the UDRS value of a verb argument, as defined 
in (10), is only appropriate for non-quantificational 
singular NPs (4). The SUBORD value pertaining to 
the argument is constrained to contain a conditi- 
on which identifies its minimal and maximal abels: 
11 = In.  The second clause applies if the semantic 
structure of the argument contains a subordination 
restriction which characterizes the NP as scope bea- 
ring. This is the case for generalized quantifiers (3). 
The values of the minimal and maximal labels are 
lain the CUF system (Doerre/Dorna 1993) delay 
statements are defined by the predicate wait. The delay- 
ed function can only be evaluated when all specified ar- 
gument positions are instantiated. The delay statement 
for dref_res is wait(dref_res(udrs, ubord_info)), where 
subord_info is the type of a member of SUBOILD. 
14 
characterized as non-identical by strong subordina- 
tion: 11 > 112. 
If a clause is applied successfully, by coindexation 
of the differentiating subordination restrictions with 
the second argument of dre\]_res, the latter gets pro- 
perly instantiated and the function is relieved from 
its delayed status. It returns the discourse referent 
which in the argument's UDRS is associated with the 
maximal abel for not scope bearing NPs, and with 
the label of the restrictor 111 for scope bearing NPs. 
For plural NPs, which are represented as potential- 
ly scope bearing by a weak subordination constraint 
as shown in (6), the clauses in (12) will fail: the re- 
quired subordination conditions will not be contai- 
ned in the SUBORD value of the verb argument. 14 
Underspecified as well as disambiguated plural NPs, 
characterized by a weak subordination constraint in 
the local UDRS, are captured by the third clause of 
dre/_res in (13).

LSUBOaD{.. l\[~ > \[i~.. 
In (13) the value of dre/_res is undefined (T) and the 
variable Cond, which is subject o the delay conditi- 
ons on dref_res, is not instantiated by coindexation 
with a subordination restriction in the local SUB- 
ORD value. The function therefore is delayed, un- 
til further disambiguating constraints are available 
which resolve the plural ambiguity and determine 
the discourse referent to fill the argument slot of the 
verb. This is what we aimed at for the special con- 
cerns of plural underspecification. 
If, however, a particular eading of a plural NP is 
determined by the lexical meaning of the verb, as it 
is the case for gather, an appropriate definition of 
dref_res in the lexical entry of the verb ensures the 
correct plural interpretation. 
P lu ra l  D isamblguat ion  In most cases, however, 
disambiguating information for the interpretation of
plurals comes from various sources of semantic or 
pragmatic knowledge. Usually it is provided by sub- 
sequent discourse. We therefore define a mechanism 
for plural disambiguation which may apply at any 
stage of the derivation, to add disambiguating DRS 
conditions and subordination constraints to the un- 
derspecified representation whenever enough infor- 
mation is available to determine a particular plural 
interpretation. To this end we extend the Semantics 
14This will be so even if - by the function pl_dis to be 
introduced below - further disambiguating constraints 
for, e.g., a collective or distributive reading are introdu- 
ced at a later stage of the derivation: dref_res i defined 
on the UDRS value of a verb argument in the lexical 
entry of the verb. The value of thfs local UDRS, and 
with it the SUBORD attribute, remains unaffected by 
the introduction of additional subordination restrict.ions 
by clauses of the Semantics Principle. 
Principle to include a function pidis (plural disam- 
biguation), which applies to a phrase's UDRS value, 
to render a new value of the same type, which spe- 
cifies a collective or distributive reading for a plural 
discourse referent contained in the underspecified re- 
presentation. The individual clauses of pLdis will ha- 
ve to state constraints for determining the respective 
plural readings, to be satisfied by the preceding con- 
text, represented in UDRS. Ideally, these constraints 
have access to inference modules, including semantic 
and pragmatic knowledge. We first state the function 
pidis for the different readings and then incorporate 
the function into the Semantics Principle. 
If in clause (14) of pLdis the constraints that deter- 
mine a collective reading of the plural NP with label 
11 are satisfied, the relation of weak subordination 
between the minimal and maximal abel of the plu- 
ral NP is strenghtened to the identity relation. In tile 
output value the restriction 11 = In gets unioned to 
the original SUBORD value. Note that the function 
pidis is fully monotonic in that its result is a UDRS 
which is obtained by only adding information to the 
input values SUBORD and CONDS by union. 
Whenever disambiguation of a plural NP takes 
place, the function dref_res must be relieved from its 
delayed status in order to instantiate the correspon- 
ding argument slot of the verb. We will access the 
delayed goal dref_res by reference to the plural NP's 
maximal and minimal labels 11 and 112, instantiate 
its second argument by the identity constraint 11 = 
112, and define its value by the DREF value X asso- 
ciated with 11. The resulting UDRS for a collective 
interpretation of (9) is given in (15).

Disambiguation to a distributive reading is obtained 
in (16) by adding a quantificational distribution con- 
dition to the original value of CONDS. The restrictor 
In introduces an individual discourse referent x to- 
gether with the distribution condition x 6 X and 
the nuclear scope is identified by the minimal label 
112. Moreover, (strong) subordination of restrictor 
and scope is defined in SUBORD. Again, the delayed 
function dref_res is defined to return the discourse 
referent x which is to fill the argument slot of the 
15 
verb and is un-delayed by instantiation of its second 
argument.

\Ve now complete the Semantics Principle by the 
Principle for Plural Disambiguation (VI). In (17), 
the function pl_dis applies in a coordination struc- 
ture coord-struc, which recursively, combines pairs of 
(sequences of) sentences and a sentence. The func- 
tion pl_dis applies to the phrase's UDRS value, which 
is defined by application of the basic clauses (I) and 
(II) of UDRS construction. Depending on the con- 
text represented in UDRS, and supplemented by ge- 
neral semantic and/or pragmatic knowledge, pl_dis 
monotonically redefines the phrase's UDRS value if 
disambiguating constraints for a specific plural rea- 
ding can be determined. If the constraints for plu- 
ral disambiguation (14) and (16) are not satisfied, 
the trivial clause of pl_dis applies, which returns the 
UDRS value of its argument without modifications.

5 Conc lus ion  and Perspect ives  
A constraint based semantic formalism for HPSG 
has been presented to replace the standard HPSG se- 
mantics. The new formalism comes closer to a princi- 
ple based construction of semantic structure and, 
therefore, is more in the spirit of HPSG philosophy 
than its standard approach. Furthermore the new 
formalism overcomes a number of shortcomings of 
the standard approach in a natural way. 
In particular, we presented an HPSG grammar for 
English that defines a syntax-semantics interface 
for the construction of U(nderspecified) D(iscourse) 
R(epresentation) S(tructure)s. The construction is 
guided by general principles, which clearly identify 
the interaction between the modules, i.e. the "inter- 
face" between syntax and semantics. In the fragment 
we defined underspecificied representations forquan- 
tificational structures and plural NPs. The princip- 
les governing the interaction of syntax and semantics 
specify scoping relations for quantifiers and quanti- 
ficational readings of plural NPs. 
In addition to the syntax/semantics nterface the Se- 
mantics Principle developed in this paper defines a 
clear interface to contextual and pragmatic knowled- 
ge. This interface allows reasoning modules to inter- 
act with semantics construction. The approach taken 
here can, therefore, be generalized to disambiguation 
problems other than the collective/distributive am- 
biguity as well as to anaphora resolution. A further 
issue to which the present account is directly related 
is incremental interpretation.
