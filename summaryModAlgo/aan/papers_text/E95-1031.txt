Abstract 
An extragrammatical sentence is what 
a normal parser fails to analyze. It is 
important to recover it using only syn- 
tactic information although results of 
recovery are better if semantic factors 
are considered. A general algorithm .for 
least-errors recognition, which is based 
only on syntactic information, was pro- 
posed by G. Lyon to deal with the ex- 
tragrammaticality. We extended this 
algorithm to recover extragrammatical 
sentence into grammatical one in run- 
ning text. Our robust parser with re- 
covery mechanism - extended general 
algorithm for least-errors recognition - 
can be easily scaled up and modified be- 
cause it utilize only syntactic informa- 
tion. To upgrade this robust parser we 
proposed heuristics through the analy- 
sis on the Penn treebank corpus. The 
experimental result shows 68% ,~ 77% 
accuracy in error recovery. 
1 In t roduct ion  
ExtragrammaticM sentences include patently un- 
grammatical constructions as well as utterances 
that may be grammaticMly acceptable but are be- 
yond the syntactic overage of a parser, and any 
other difficult ones that are encountered in parsing 
(Carbonell and Hayes, 1983).

Above examples how that people are used to 
write same meaningful sentences differently. In 
addition, people are prone to mistakes in writing 
sentences. So, the bulk of written sentences are 
open to the extragrammaticality. 
In the Penn treebank tree-tagged cor- 
pus(Marcus, 1991), for instance, about 80 per- 
cents of the rules are concerned with peculiar 
sentences which include inversive, elliptic, paren- 
thetic, or emphatic phrases. For example, we can 
drive a rule VP ---, vb NP comma rb comma PP 
from the following sentence.

./.) 
A robust parser is one that can analyze these 
extragrammaticalsentences without failure. How- 
ever, if we try to preserve robustness by adding 
such rules whenever we encounter an extra- 
grammatical sentence, the rulebase will grow up 
rapidly, and thus processing and maintaining the 
excessive number of rules will become inefficient 
and impractical. Therefore, extragrammatical 
sentences hould be handled by some recovery 
mechanism(s) rather than by a set of additional 
rules. 
Many researchers have attempted several tech- 
niques to deal with extragrammatical sentences 
such as Augmented Transition Network(ATN) 
(Kwasny and Sondheimer, 1981), network-based 
semantic grammar (Hendrix, 1977), partial pat- 
tern matching (Hayes and Mouradian, 1981), con- 
ceptual case frame (Schank et al, 1980), and mul- 
tiple cooperating methods (Hayes and Carbonell, 
1981). Above mentioned techniques take into ac- 
count various emantic factors depending on spe- 
cific domains on question in recovering extragram- 
matical sentences. W\]lereas they can provide ven 
better solutions intrinsically, they are usually ad- 
hoc and are lack of extensibility. Therefore, it is 
223 
important o recover extragrammatical sentences 
using syntactic factors only, which are indepen- 
dent of any particular system and any particular 
domain. 
Mellish (Mellish, 1989) introduced some chart- 
based techniques using only syntactic information 
for extragrammatical sentences. This technique 
has an advantage that there is no repeating work 
for the chart to prevent he parser from generat- 
ing the same edge as the previously existed edge. 
Also, because the recovery process runs when a 
normal parser terminates unsuccessfully, the per- 
formance of the normal parser does not decrease in 
case of handling grammatical sentences. However, 
his experiment was not based on the errors in run- 
ning texts but on artificial ones which were ran- 
domly generated by human. Moreover, only one 
word error was considered though several word er- 
rors can occur simultaneously in the running text. 
A general algorithm for least-errors recognition 
(Lyon, 1974), proposed by G. Lyon, is to find out 
the least number of errors necessary to success- 
ful parsing and recover them. Because this algo- 
rithm is also syntactically oriented and baaed on 
a chart, it has the same advantzrge as that of Mel- 
lish's parser. When the original parsing algorithm 
terminates unsuccessfully, the algorithm begins to 
assume rrors of insertion, deletion and mutation 
of a word. For any input, including grammat- 
ical and extragrammatical sentences, this algo- 
rithm can generate the resultant parse tree. At 
the cost of the complete robustness, however, this 
algorithm degrades the efficiency of parsing, and 
generates many intermediate edges. 
In this paper, we present a robust parser with 
a recovery mechanism. We extend the general al- 
gorithm for least-errors recognition to adopt it as 
the recovery mechanism in our robust parser. Be- 
cause our robust parser handle extragrammatical 
sentences with this syntactic information oriented 
recovery mechanism, it can be independent of a 
particular system or particular domain. Also, we 
present the heuristics to reduce the number of 
edges so that we can upgrade the performance of 
our parser. 
This paper is organized as follows : We first 
review a general algorithm for least-errors recog- 
nition. Then we present he extension of this al- 
gorithm, and the heuristics adopted by the robust 
parser. Next, we describe the implementation f 
the system and the result of the experiment of 
parsing real sentences. Finally, we make conclu- 
sion with future direction. 
2 Algorithm and Heuristics 
2.1 Genera l  a lgor i thm for  leas t -e r rors  
recogn i t ion  
The general algorithm for least-errors recognition 
(Lyon, 1974), which is based on Earley's algo- 
rithm, assumes that sentences may have insertion,

Figure 1: SCAN processing 
deletion, and mutation errors of terminal symbols. 
The objective of this algorithm is to parse input 
string with the least number of errors. 
A state used in this algorithm is quadruple (p, 
j, f, e J, where p is a production umber in gram- 
mar, j marks a position in RHS(p), f is  a start po- 
sition of the state in input string, and e is an error 
value. 1 A final state (p, p_-I-1, f, e) denotes recog- 
nition of a phrase RHS(p) with e errors where _p is 
a number of components in rule p. A stateset S(i), 
where i is the position of the input, is an ordered 
set of states. States within a stateset are ordered 
by ascending value of 3", within a p within a f ; f 
takes descending value. 
When adding to statesets, ff state (p, j, f, e) 
is a candidate for admission to a stateset which 
already has a similar member (p, j, f,, e') and e' 
_~ e, then (p, j, f, e) is rejected. However, if e'  > 
e, then (p, j, f, e') is replaced by (p, j, f, e). 
The algorithm works as follows : A procedure 
SCAN is carried out for each state in S(i). SCAN 
checks various correspondences of input token t(i) 
against terminal symbols in RHS of rules. Once 
SCAN is done, COMPLETER substitutes all final 
states of S(i) into all other analyses which can use 
them as components. 
SCAN 
SCAN handles states of S(i), checking each in- 
put terminal against requirements of states in S(i) 
and various error hypotheses. Figure 1 shows how 
SCAN processes.

2.2 Extens ion  o f  leas t -e r rors  recogn i t ion  
a lgor i thm 
The algorithm in section 2.1 can analyze any in- 
put string with the least number of errors. But 
this algorithm can handle only the errors of termi- 
nal symbols because it doesn't consider the errors 
of nonterminal nodes. In the real text, however, 
the insertion, deletion, or inversion of a phrase 
- namely, nonterminal node - occurs more fre- 
quently. So, we extend the original algorithm in" 
order to handle the errors of nonterminal symbols 
as well. 
In our extended algorithm, the same SCAN as 
that of the original algorithm is used, while COM- 
PLETER is modified and extended. Figure 2 
shows the processing of extended-COMPLETER. 
In figure 2, \[NP\] denotes the final state whose rule 
has NP as its LHS. In other words, it means the 
recognition of a noun phrase.

The extended least-errors recognition algorithm

2.3 Heur i s t i cs  
The robust pa~ser using the extended least-errors 
recognition algorithm overgenerates many error- 
hypothesis edges during parsing process. To cope 
with this problem, we adjust error values accord- 
ing to the following heuristics. Edges with more 
error values are regarded as less important ones, 
so that those edges are processed later than those 
of less error values. 
tWe know that the phrase mutation-error hypothe- 
sis is not meaningful in the red text because we cannot 
find out any example of phrase mutation-error in the 
corpus. So we didn't implement the phrase mutation- 
error hypothesis. 
225 
? Heur i s t i cs  1: e r ro r  types  
The analysis on 3,538 sentences of the Penn 
treebank corpus WS:I shows that there are 
498 sentences with phrase deletions and 224 
sentences with phrase insertions. So, we 
assign less error value to the deletion-error 
hypothesis edge than to the insertion- and 
mutation-errors. 
a <~ 
~deletion <= Oeinsertion ~ ~mutat ion 
~deletion ~ ~insergiort 
where ~ is the error cost of a terminal sym- 
bol,/~ is the error cost of a nonterminal sym- 
bol. 
? Heur i s t i cs  2: f iduc ia l  nontermina l  
People often make mistakes in writing En- 
glish. These mistakes usually take place 
rather between small constituents uch as 
a verbal phrase, an adverbial phrase and 
noun phrase than within small constituents 
themselves. The possibility of error occur- 
rence within noun phrases are lower than be- 
tween a noun phrase and a verbal phrase, 
a preposition phrase, an adverbial phrase. 
So, we assume some phrases, for example 
noun phrases, as fiducial nonterminals, which 
means error-free nonterminals. When han- 
dling sentences, the robust parser assings 
more error values(61) to the error hypothesis 
edge occurring within a fiducial nonterminal. 
? Heur i s t i cs  3: k inds  o f  te rmina l  symbo ls  
Some terminal symbols like punctuation 
symbols, conjunctions and particles are of- 
ten misused. So, the robust parser assigns 
less error values(-52) to the error hypothesis 
edges with these symbols than to the other 
terminal symbols. 
? Heur i s t i cs  4:  i nser ted  phrases  between 
commas or  parentheses  
Most of inserted phrases are surrounded by 
commas or parentheses. For example, 
a. They're active , genera l ly  , at night or on 
damp, cloudy days. 
b. All refrigerators , whether they are defrosted 
manually or not ,  need to be cleaned. 
c.  I was a last-minute ( read intedopin9 ) at- 
tendee at a French journalism convention .-. 
We will assign less error values(-6a) to the 
insertion-error hypothesis edges of nontermi- 
nals which are embraced by comma or paren- 
thesis. 
61 and 62 are weights for the error of terminal 
nodes, and 68 is a weight for the error of nonter- 
minal nodes. 
The error value e of an edge is calculated as 
follows. All error values are additive. 
The error value e for a rule X ~ a lA la2 . . ,  a~Aj, 
where a is a terminal node and A is a nonterminal 
node, is 
1. e= eT + 
e + 61 - 62 if terminal error 
2. eT : 0 otherwise 
{ /~ - 6s -t- ech,d if nonterminal 3. eNT - - "  error 
echild otherwise 
where a E {ain..r:ion, adele.on, amutation}, fl E 
{/~in.er.o.,/~&/etion} and ech.d is an error value 
of a child edge. 
By these heuristics, our robust parser can pro- 
cess only plausible edges first, inste~i of process- 
ing all generated edges at the same time, so that 
we can enhance the performance of the robust 
parser and result in the great reduction in the 
number of resultant rees.

3.1 The  robust  parser  
Our robust parsing system is composed of two 
modules. One module is a normal parser which 
is the bottom-up chart parser. The other is a 
robust parser with the error recovery mechanism 
proposed herein. At first, an input sentence is 
processed by the normal parser. I f  the sentence 
is within the grammatical  coverage of the system, 
the normal parser succeed to analyze it. Other- 
wise, the normal parser fails, and then the robust 
parser starts to execute with edges generated by 
the normal parser. The result of the robust parser 
is the parse trees which are within the grammat-  
ical coverage of the system. The overview of the 
system is shown in figure 3.

3.2 Exper imenta l  resu l t  
To show usefulness of the robust parser proposed 
in this paper, we made some experiments. 
? Rule 
We can derive 4,958 rules and their frequen- 
cies out of 14,137 sentences in the Penn

treebank tree-tagged corpus, the Wall Street 
Journal. The average frequency of each rule 
is 48 times in the corpus. Of these rules, we 
remove rules which occurs fewer times than 
the average frequency in the corpus, and then 
only 192 rules are left. These removed rules 
are almost for peculiar sentences and the left 
rules are very general rules. We can show 
that our robust parser can compensate for 
lack of rules using only 192 rules with the 
recovery mechanism and heuristics. 
? Test set 
First, 1,000 sentences are selected randomly 
from the WSJ corpus, which we have referred 
to in proposing the robust parser. Of these 
sentences, 410 are failed in normal parsing, 
and are processed again by the robust parser. 
To show the validity of these heuristics, we 
compare the result of the robust parser us- 
ing heuristics with one not using heuristics. 
Second, to show the adaptability of our ro- 
bust parser, same experiments are carried 
out on 1,000 sentences from the ATIS cor- 
pus in Penn treebank, which we haven't re- 
ferred to when we propose the robust parser. 
Among 1,000 sentences from the ATIS, 465 
sentences are processed by the robust parser 
after the failure of the normal parsing. 
? Parameter  adjustment 
We chose the best parameters of heuristics 
by executing several experiments.

Ctd~:~,io, : 10.4 ~a,~,t~ : 20.0 
otmuto.~ : 10.8 
61 : 0.01 62 : 5.0 
~3 : 1.0 
Accuracy is measured as the percentage of con- 
stituents in the test sentences which do not cross 
any Penn treebank constituents (Black, 1991). 
Table 1 shows the results of the robust parser 
on WSJ. In table 1, 5th, 6th and 7th raw mean 
that the percentage of sentences which have no 
crossing constituents, less than one crossing and 
less than two crossing respectively. With heuris- 
tics, our robust parser can enhance the processing 
time and reduce the number of edges. Also, the 
accuracy is improved from 72.8% to 77.1% even if 
the heuristics differentiate edges and prefer some 
edges. It shows that the proposed heuristics is 
valid in parsing the real sentences. The experi- 
ment says that our robust parser with heuristics 
can recover perfectly about 23 sentences out of 100 
sentences which axe just failed in normal parsing, 
as the percentage ofno-crossing sentences i about 
23.28%. 
Table 2 is the results of the robust parser on 
ATIS which we did not refer to before. The accu- 
racy of the result on ATIS is lower than WSJ be- 
cause the parameters ofthe heuristics are a~justed 
not by ATIS itself but by WSJ. However, the 
percentage ofsentences with constituents crossing 
less than 2 is higher than the WSJ, as sentences 
of ATIS are more or less simple. 
The experimental results of our robust parser 
show high accuracy in recovery even though 96% 
of total rules are removed. It is impossible to con- 
struct complete grammar rules in the real parsing 
system to succeed in analyzing every real sentence. 
So, parsing systems are likely to have extragram- 
matical sentences which cannot be analyzed by 
the systems. Our robust parser can recover these 
extragrammatical sentences with 68 ~ 77% accu- 
racy. 
It is very interesting that parameters of heuris- 
tics reflect the characteristics of the test corpus. 
For example, if people tend to write sentences with 
inserted phrases, then the parameter fli,~sert~on 
must increase. Therefore we can get better esults 
if the parameter are fitted to the characteristics of
the corpus. 
4 Conclusion 
In this paper, we have presented the robust parser 
with the extended least-errors recognition algo- 
rithm as the recovery mechanism. This robust 
parser can easily be scaled up and applied to var- 
ious domains because this parser depends only on 
syntactic factors. To enhance the performance of 
the robust parser for extragrainmatical sentences,

we proposed several heuristics. The heuristics as- 
sign the error values to each error-hypothesis edge, 
and edges which has less error values axe processed 
first. So, not all the generated edges are processed 
by the robust parser, but the most plausible parse 
trees can be generated first. The accuracy of the 
recovery in our robust parser is about 68% ,,~ 77~. 
Hence, this parser is suitable for systems in real 
application areas. 
Our short term goal is to propose an automatic 
method that can learn parameter values of heuris- 
tics by analyzing the corpus. We expect hat au- 
tomatically leaxned values of parameters can up- 
grade the performance of the parser.
