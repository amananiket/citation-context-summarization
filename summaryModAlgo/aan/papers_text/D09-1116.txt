Abstract
We present a scalable joint language
model designed to utilize fine-grain syn-
tactic tags. We discuss challenges such
a design faces and describe our solutions
that scale well to large tagsets and cor-
pora. We advocate the use of relatively
simple tags that do not require deep lin-
guistic knowledge of the language but pro-
vide more structural information than POS
tags and can be derived from automati-
cally generated parse trees ? a combina-
tion of properties that allows easy adop-
tion of this model for new languages. We
propose two fine-grain tagsets and evalu-
ate our model using these tags, as well as
POS tags and SuperARV tags in a speech
recognition task and discuss future direc-
tions.
1 Introduction
In a number of language processing tasks, particu-
larly automatic speech recognition (ASR) and ma-
chine translation (MT), there is the problem of se-
lecting the best sequence of words from multiple
hypotheses. This problem stems from the noisy
channel approach to these applications. The noisy
channel model states that the observed data, e.g.,
the acoustic signal, is the result of some input
translated by some unknown stochastic process.
Then the problem of finding the best sequence of
words given the acoustic input, not approachable
directly, is transformed into two separate models:
argmax
w
n
1
p(w
n
1
|A) = argmax
w
n
1
p(A|w
n
1
) ? p(w
n
1
)
(1)
where A is the acoustic signal and wn
1
is a se-
quence of n words. p(A|wn
1
) is called an acoustic
model and p(wn
1
) is the language model1.
Typically, these applications use language mod-
els that compute the probability of a sequence in a
generative way:
p(w
n
1
) =
n
?
i=1
p(w
i
|w
i?1
1
)
Approximation is required to keep the parameter
space tractable. Most commonly the context is re-
duced to just a few immediately preceding words.
This type of model is called an ngram model:
p(w
i
|w
i?1
1
) ? p(w
i
|w
i?1
i?n+1
)
Even with limited context, the parameter space can
be quite sparse and requires sophisticated tech-
niques for reliable probability estimation (Chen
and Goodman, 1996). While the ngram models
perform fairly well, they are only capable of cap-
turing very shallow knowledge of the language.
There is extensive literature on a variety of
methods that have been used to imbue models
with syntactic and semantic information in differ-
ent ways. These methods can be broadly catego-
rized into two types:
? The first method uses surface words within
its context, sometimes organizing them into
deterministic classes. Models of this type in-
clude: (Brown et al, 1992; Zitouni, 2007),
which use semantic word clustering, and
(Bahl et al, 1990), which uses variable-
length context.
? The other method adds stochastic variables
to express the ambiguous nature of surface
words2. To obtain the probability of the next

instead of Eq. 1, where ? and ? are set to optimize a heldout
set.

the stochastic variables, as in Eq. 2.

Models of this type, which we call joint
models since they essentially predict joint
events of words and some random vari-
able(s), include (Chelba and Jelinek, 2000)
which used POS tags in combination with
?parser instructions? for constructing a full
parse tree in a left-to-right manner; (Wang
et al, 2003) used SuperARVs (complex tu-
ples of dependency information) without re-
solving the dependencies, thus called almost
parsing; (Niesler and Woodland, 1996; Hee-
man, 1999) utilize part of speech (POS) tags.
Note that some models reduce the context by
making the following approximation:
p(w
i
t

1
t

1
) ? p(w
i
|t
i
)?p(t

|t

) (3)
thus, transforming the problem into a stan-
dard HMM application. However, these
models perform poorly and have only been
able to improve over the ngram model when
interpolated with it (Niesler and Woodland,
1996).
Although joint models have the potential
to better express variability in word usage
through the introduction of additional latent
variables, they do not necessarily perform
better because the increased dimensionality
of the context substantially increases the al-
ready complex problem of parameter estima-
tion. The complexity of the space also makes
computation of the probability a challenge
because of space and time constraints. This
makes the choice of the random variables a
matter of utmost importance.
The model presented in this paper has some el-
ements borrowed from prior work, notably (Hee-
man, 1999; Xu and Jelinek, 2004), while others
are novel.
1.1 Paper Outline
The message we aim to deliver in this paper can
be summarized in two theses:
? Use fine-grain syntactic tags in a joint LM.
We propose a joint language model that can
be used with a variety of tagsets. In Section
2, we describe those that we used in our ex-
periments. Rather than tailoring our model to
these tagsets, we aim for flexibility and pro-
pose an information theoretic framework for
quick evaluation for tagsets, thus simplifying
the creation of new tagsets. We show that
our model with fine-grain tagsets outperform
the coarser POS model, as well as the ngram
baseline, in Section 5.
? Address the challenges that arise in a joint
language model with fine-grain tags. While
the idea of using joint language modeling is
not novel (Chelba and Jelinek, 2000; Hee-
man, 1999), nor is the idea of using fine-grain
tags (Bangalore, 1996; Wang et al, 2003),
none of prior papers focus on the issues that
arise from the combination of joint language
modeling with fine-grain tags, both in terms
of reliable parameter estimation and scalabil-
ity in the face of the increased computational
complexity. We dedicate Sections 3 and 4 to
this problem.
In Section 6, we summarize conclusions and lay
out directions for future work.
2 Structural Information
As we have mentioned, the selection of the ran-
dom variable in Eq. 2 is extremely important for
the performance of the model. On one hand, we
would like for this variable to provide maximum
information. On the other hand, as the number of
parameters grow, we must address reliable param-
eter estimation in the face of sparsity, as well as
increased computational complexity. In the fol-
lowing section we will compare the use of Super-
ARVs, POS tags, and other structural tags derived
from parse trees.
2.1 POS Tags
Part-of-speech tags can be easily obtained for
unannotated data using off-the-shelf POS taggers
or PCFG parsers. However, the amount of infor-
mation these tags typically provide is very limited,
1115
Figure 1: A parse tree example
e.g., while it is helpful to know whether fly is a
verb or a noun, knowing that you is a personal pro-
noun does not carry the information whether it is
a subject or an object (given the Penn Tree Bank
tagset), which would certainly help to predict the
following word.
2.2 SuperARV
The SuperARV essentially organizes information
concerning one consistent set of dependency links
for a word that can be directly derived from its
syntactic parse. SuperARVs encode lexical in-
formation as well as syntactic and semantic con-
straints in a uniform representation that is much
more fine-grained than POS. It is a four-tuple
(C;F ;R+;D), where C is the lexical category
of the word, F is a vector of lexical features for
the word, R+ is a set of governor and need labels
that indicate the function of the word in the sen-
tence and the types of words it needs, and D rep-
resents the relative position of the word and its de-
pendents. We refer the reader to the literature for
further details on SuperARVs (Wang and Harper,
2002; Wang et al, 2003).
SuperARVs can be produced from parse trees
by applying deterministic rules. In this work we
use SuperARVs as individual tags and do not clus-
ter them based of their structure. While Super-
ARVs are very attractive for language modeling,
developing such a rich set of annotations for a new
language would require a large amount of human
effort.
We propose two other types of tags which have
not been applied to this task, although similar in-
formation has been used in parsing.
2.3 Modifee Tag
This tag is a combination of the word?s POS
tag and the POS tag of its governor role. We
designed it to resemble dependency parse struc-
ture. For example, the sentence in Figure 1 would
be tagged: the/DT-NN black/JJ-NN cat/NN-VBD
sat/VBD-root. Henceforth, we will refer to this
kind of tag as head.
2.4 Parent Constituent
This tag is a combination of the word?s POS tag
with its immediate parent in the parse tree, along
with the POS tag?s relative position among its sib-
lings. We refer to this type of tags as parent. The
example in Figure 1 will be tagged: the/DT-NP-
start black/JJ-NP-mid cat/NN-NP-end sat/VB-VP-
single. This tagset is designed to represent con-
stituency information.
Note that the head and parent tagsets are more
language-independent (all they require is a tree-
bank) than the SuperARVs which, not only uti-
lized the treebank, but were explicitly designed by
a linguist for English only.
2.5 Information Theoretic Comparison of
Tags
As we have mentioned in Section 1, the choice of
the tagset is very important to the performance of
the model. There are two conflicting intuitions for
tags: on one hand they should be specific enough
to be helpful in the language model?s task; on the
other hand, they should be easy for the LM to pre-
dict.
Of course, in order to argue which tags are more
suitable, we need some quantifiable metrics. We
propose an information theoretic approach:
? To quantify how hard it is to predict a tag, we
compute the conditional entropy:
H
p
(t
i
|w
i
) = H
p
(t
i
w
i
)?H
p
(w
i
)
=
?
w
i
t
i
p(t
i
w
i
) log p(t
i
|w
i
)
? To measure how helpful a tagset is in the LM
task, we compute the reduction of the condi-
tional cross entropy:
H
p?,q
(w
i
|w
i?1
t
i?1
) ?H
p?,q
(w
i
|w
i?1
) =
?
?
w
i
i?1
t
i?1
p?(w
i
i?1
t
i?1
) log q(w
i
|w
i?1
t
i?1
)
+
?
w
i
i?1
p?(w
i
i?1
) log q(w
i
|w
i?1
)
= ?
?
w
i

t
i?1
p?(w

t
i?1
) log
q(w
i
|w
i?1
t
i?1
)
q(w
i
|w
i?1
)
1116
Note that in this case we use conditional
cross entropy because conditional entropy
has the tendency to overfit the data as we se-
lect more and more fine-grain tags. Indeed,
H
p
(w
i
|w
i?1
t
i?1
) can be reduced to zero if
the tags are specific enough, which would
never happen in reality. This is not a prob-
lem for the former metric because the con-
text there, w
i
, is fixed. For this metric, we
use a smoothed distribution p? computed on
the training set3 and the test distribution q.

Figure 2: Changes in entropy for different tagsets
The results of these measurements are presented
in Figure 2. POS tags, albeit easy to predict, pro-
vide very little additional information about the
following word, and therefore we would not ex-
pect them to perform very well. The parent tagset
seems to perform somewhat better than Super-
ARVs ? it provides 0.13 bits more information
while being only 0.09 bits harder to predict based
on the word. The head tagset is interesting: it pro-
vides 0.2 bits more information about the follow-
ing word (which would correspond to 15% per-
plexity reduction if we had perfect tags), but on
the other hand the model is less likely to predict
these tags accurately.
This approach is only a crude estimate (it uses
only unigram and bigram context) but it is very
useful for designing tagsets, e.g., for a new lan-
guage, because it allows us to assess relative per-
formance of tagsets without having to train a full
model.
3We used one-count smoothing (Chen and Goodman,
1996).
3 Language Model Structure
The size and sparsity of the parameter space of the
joint model necessitate the use of dimensionality
reduction measures in order to make the model
computationally tractable and to allow for accu-
rate estimation of the model?s parameters. We also
want the model to be able to easily accommodate
additional sources of information such as morpho-
logical features, prosody, etc. In the rest of this
section, we discuss avenues we have taken to ad-
dress these problems.
3.1 Decision Tree Clustering
Binary decision tree clustering has been shown to
be effective for reducing the parameter space in
language modeling (Bahl et al, 1990; Heeman,
1999) and other language processing applications,
e.g., (Magerman, 1994). Like any clustering algo-
rithm, it can be represented by a function H that
maps the space of histories to a set of equivalence
classes.
p(w
i
t
i
|w
i?1
i?n+1

i?1
i?n+1
) ? p(w
i
t
i
|H(w
i?1
i?n+1
t
i?1
i?n+1
))
(4)
While the tree construction algorithm is fairly
standard ? to recursively select binary questions
about the history optimizing some function ? there
are important decisions to make in terms of which
questions to ask and which function to optimize.
In the remainder of this section, we discuss the de-
cisions we made regarding these issues.
3.2 Factors
The Factored Language Model (FLM) (Bilmes
and Kirchhoff, 2003) offers a convenient view of
the input data: it represents every word in a sen-
tence as a tuple of factors. This allows us to extend
the language model with additional parameters. In
an FLM, however, all factors have to be determin-
istically computed in a joint model; whereas, we
need to distinguish between the factors that are
given or computed and the factors that the model
must predict stochastically. We call these types
of factors overt and hidden, respectively. Exam-
ples of overt factors include surface words, mor-
phological features such as suffixes, case informa-
tion when available, etc., and the hidden factors
are POS, SuperARVs, or other tags.
Henceforth, we will use word to represent the
set of overt factors and tag to represent the set of
hidden factors.
1117
3.3 Hidden Factors Tree
Similarly to (Heeman, 1999), we construct a bi-
nary tree where each tag is a leaf; we will refer
to this tree as the Hidden Factors Tree (HFT). We
use Minimum Discriminative Information (MDI)
algorithm (Zitouni, 2007) to build the tree. The
HFT represents a hierarchical clustering of the tag
space. One of the reasons for doing this is to allow
questions about subsets of tags rather than individ-
ual tags alone4.
Unlike (Heeman, 1999), where the tree of tags
was only used to create questions, this representa-
tion of the tag space is, in addition, a key feature
of our decoding optimizations, which we discuss
in Section 4.
3.4 Questions
The context space is partitioned by means of bi-
nary questions. We use different types of ques-
tions for hidden and overt factors.
? Questions about surface words are con-
structed using the Exchange algorithm (Mar-
tin et al, 1998). This algorithm takes the set
of words that appear at a certain position in
the training data associated with the current
node in the history tree and divides the set
into two complementary subsets greedily op-
timizing some target function (we use the av-
erage entropy of the marginalized word dis-
tribution, the same as for question selection).
Note that since the algorithm only operates
on the words that appear in the training data,
we need to do something more to account for
the unseen words. Thus, to represent this type
of question, we create the history tree struc-
ture depicted in Fig. 4.
For other overt factors with smaller vocabu-
laries, such as suffixes, we use equality ques-
tions.
? As we mentioned in Section 3.3, we use the
Hidden Factors Tree to create questions about
hidden factors. Note that every node in a bi-
nary tree can be represented by a binary path
from the root with all nodes under an inner
node sharing the same prefix. Thus, a ques-
tion about whether a tag belongs to a subset
4Trying all possible subsets of tags is not feasible since
there are 2|T | of them. The tree allows us to reduce the num-
ber to O(T ) of the most meaningful (as per the clustering
algorithm) subsets.

of tags dominated by a node can be expressed
as whether the tag?s path matches the binary
prefix.
3.5 Optimization Criterion and Stopping
Rule
To select questions we use the average entropy of
the marginalized word distribution. We found that
this criterion significantly outperforms the entropy
of the distribution of joint events. This is proba-
bly due to the increased sparsity of the joint distri-
bution and the fact that our ultimate metrics, i.e.,
WER and word perplexity, involve only words.
3.6 Distribution Representation
In a cluster H
x
, we factor the joint distribution as
follows:
p(w
i
t
i
|H
x
) = p(w
i
|H
x
) ? p(t
i
|w
i
, H
x
)
where p(t
i
|w
i
, H
x
) is represented in the form of
an HFT, in which each leaf has the probability of a
tag and each internal node contains the sum of the
probabilities of the tags it dominates. This repre-
sentation is designed to assist the decoding process
described in Section 4.
3.7 Smoothing
In order to estimate probability distributions at the
leaves of the history tree, we use the following re-
cursive formula:
p?
n
(w
i
t
i
) = ?
n
p
n
(w
i
t
i
) + (1? ?
n
)p?

(w

t
i
) (5)
where n? is the n-th node?s parent, p
n
(w
i
t
i
) is
the distribution at node n (see Figure 3). The
1118
root of the tree is interpolated with the distribu-
tion p
unif
(w
i
t
i
) =
1
|V |
p
ML
(t

|w

)
5
. To estimate
interpolation parameters ?
n
, we use the EM algo-
rithm described in (Magerman, 1994); however,
rather than setting aside a separate development
set of optimizing ?
n
, we use 4-fold cross valida-
tion and take the geometric mean of the resulting
coefficients6. We chose this approach because a
small development set often does not overlap with
the training set for low-count nodes, leading the
EM algorithm to set ?
n
= 0 for those nodes.
Let us consider one leaf of the history tree in
isolation. Its context can be represented by the
path to the root, i.e., the sequence of questions and
answers q
1
, . . . q
(n

)
?q

? (with q

being the answer
to the topmost question):

) = p?(w

Represented this way, Eq. 5 is a variant of Jelinek-
Mercer smoothing:

For backoff nodes (see Fig. 4), we use a lower
order model7 interpolated with the distribution at
the backoff node?s grandparent (see node A in Fig.
4):

How to compute ?
A
is an open question. For this
study, we use a simple heuristic based on obser-
vation that the further node A is from the root
the more reliable the distribution p?
A
(w
i
t
i
) is, and
hence ?
A
is lower. The formula we use is as fol-
lows:
?
A
=
1
?
1 + distanceToRoot(A)
5We use this distribution rather than uniform joint distri-
bution 1
|V ||T |
because we do not want to allow word-tag pairs
that have never been observed. The idea is similar to (Thede
and Harper, 1999).
6To avoid a large number of zeros due to the product, we
set a minimum for ? to be 10?7.
7The lower order model is constructed by the same algo-
rithm, although with smaller context. Note that the lower or-
der model can back off on words or tags, or both. In this paper
we backoff both on words and tags, i.e., p(w
i
t
i
|w
i?1
i?2
t
i?1
i?2
)
backs off to p(w
i
t
i
|w
i?1
t
i?1
), which in turn backs off to the
unigram p(w
i
t
i
).

in the training data at the node A. To account for
unseen words, we add the backoff node B.
4 Decoding
As in HMM decoding, in order to compute prob-
abilities for i-th step, we need to sum over |T |n?1
possible combinations of tags in the history, where
T is the set of tags and n is the order of the
model. With |T | predictions for the i-th step, we
have O(|T |n) computational complexity per word.
Straightforward computation of these probabili-
ties is problematic even for a trigram model with
POS tags, i.e., n = 3, |T | ? 40. A standard ap-
proach to limit computational requirements is to
use beam search where only N most likely paths
are retained. However, with fine-grain tags where
|T | ? 1, 500, a tractable beam size would only
cover a small fraction of the whole space, leading
to search errors such as pruning good paths.
Note that we have a history clustering function
(Eq. 4) represented by the decision tree, and we
should be able to exploit this clustering to elimi-
nate unnecessary computations involving equiva-
lent histories. Note that words in the history are
known exactly, thus we can create a projection of
the clustering function H in Eq. 4 to the plane
w
i?1
i?n+1
= const, i.e., where words in the context
are fixed to be whatever is observed in the history:

The number of distinct clusters in the projection

can vary greatly for different words wi?1

thus, the number of probabilities that we need to
compute is | ?H

=const
| ? |T |.
Our decoding algorithm works similarly to
HMM decoding with the exception that the set of
hidden states is not predetermined. Let us illus-
trate how it works in the case of a bigram model.
Recall that the set of tags T is represented as a
binary tree (HFT) and the only type of questions
about tags is about matching a binary prefix in the
HFT. Such a question dissects the HFT into two
parts as depicted in Figure 5. The cost of this op-
eration is O(log |T |).
We represent states in the decoding lattice as
shown in the Figure 6, where pS

where IN

the set of tags generated from the state S? repre-

Higher order models work similarly, except that

5 Experimental Setup
To evaluate the impact of fine-grain tags on lan-
guage modeling, we trained our model with five
settings: In the first model, questions were re-
stricted to be about overt factors only, thus making
it a tree-based word model. In the second model,
we used POS tags. To evaluate the effect of fine-
grain tags, we train two models: head and parent
described in Section 2.3 and Section 2.4 respec-
tively. Since our joint model can be used with
any kind of tags, we also trained it with Super-
ARV tags (Wang et al, 2003). The SuperARVs
were created from the same parse trees that were
used to produce POS and fine-grain tags. All our
models, including SuperARV, use trigram context.
We include standard trigram, four-gram, and five-
1120
gram models for reference. The ngram models
were trained using SRILM toolkit with interpo-
lated modified Kneser-Ney smoothing.
We evaluate our model with an nbest rescoring
task using 100-best lists from the DARPA WSJ?93
and WSJ?92 20k open vocabulary data sets. The
details on the acoustic model used to produce the
nbest lists can be found in (Wang and Harper,
2002). Since the data sets are small, we com-
bined the 93et and 93dt sets for evaluation and
used 92et for the optimization8. We transformed
the nbest lists to match PTB tokenization, namely
separating possessives from nouns, n?t from auxil-
iary verbs in contractions, as well as contractions
from personal pronouns.
All language models were trained on the NYT
1994-1995 section of the English Gigaword cor-
pus (approximately 70M words). Since the New
York Times covers a wider range of topics than
the Wall Street Journal, we eliminated the most ir-
relevant stories based on their trigram coverage by
sections 00-22 of WSJ. We also eliminated sen-
tences over 120 words, because the parser?s per-
formance drops significantly on long sentences.
After parsing the corpus, we deleted sentences that
were assigned a very low probability by the parser.
Overall we removed only a few percent of the data;
however, we believe that such a rigorous approach
to data cleaning is important for building discrim-
inating models.
Parse trees were produced by an extended ver-
sion of the Berkeley parser (Huang and Harper,
2009). We trained the parser on a combination of
the BN and WSJ treebanks, preprocessed to make
them more consistent with each other. We also
modified the trees for the speech recognition task
by replacing numbers and abbreviations with their
verbalized forms. We pre-processed the NYT cor-
pus in the same way, and parsed it. After that, we
removed punctuation and downcased words. For
the ngram model, we used text processed in the
same way.
In head and parent models, tag vocabularies
contain approximately 1,500 tags each, while the
SuperARV model has approximately 1,400 dis-
tinct SuperARVs, most of which represent verbs
(1,200).
In these experiments we did not use overt fac-
tors other than the surface word because they split

<unk>, effectively changing the vocabulary thus
making perplexity incomparable to models with-
out these factors, without improving WER notice-
ably. However, we do plan to use more overt
factors in Machine Translation experiments where
a language model faces a wider range of OOV
phenomena, such as abbreviations, foreign words,
numbers, dates, time, etc.
Table 1 summarizes performance of the LMs on
the rescoring task. The parent tags model outper-
forms the trigram baseline model by 0.8% WER.
Note that four- and five-gram models fail to out-
perform the trigram baseline. We believe this is
due to the sparsity as well as relatively short sen-
tences in the test set (16 words on average).
Interestingly, whereas the improvement of the
POS model over the baseline is not statistically
significant (p < 0.10)9, the fine-grain models out-
perform the baseline much more reliably: p <
0.03 (SuperARV) and p < 0.007 (parent).
We present perplexity evaluations in Table 2.
The perplexity was computed on Section 23 of
WSJ PTB, preprocessed as the rest of the data we
used. The head model has the lowest perplexity
outperforming the baseline by 9%. Note, it even
outperforms the five-gram model, although by a
small 2% margin.
Although the improvements by the fine-grain
tagsets over POS are not significant (due to the
small size of the test set), the reductions in per-
plexity suggest that the improvements are not ran-
dom.

tion of the mapsswe test.

6 Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we presented a joint language mod-
eling framework. Unlike any prior work known
to us, it was not tailored for any specific tag set,
rather it was designed to accommodate any set
of tags, especially large sets (? 1, 000), which
present challenges one does not encounter with
smaller tag sets, such at POS tags. We discussed
these challenges and our solutions to them. Some
of the solutions proposed are novel, particularly
the decoding algorithm.
We also proposed two simple fine-grain tagsets,
which, when applied in language modeling, per-
form comparably to highly sophisticated tag sets
(SuperARV). We would like to stress that, while
our fine-grain tags did not significantly outperform
SuperARVs, the former use much less linguistic
knowledge and can be automatically induced for
any language with a treebank.
Because a joint language model inherently pre-
dicts hidden events (tags), it can also be used to
generate the best sequence of those events, i.e.,
tagging. We evaluated our model in the POS tag-
ging task and observed similar results: the fine-
grain models outperform the POS model, while
both outperform the state-of-the-art HMM POS
taggers. We refer to (Filimonov and Harper, 2009)
for details on these experiments.
We plan to investigate how parser accuracy and
data selection strategies, e.g., based on parser con-
fidence scores, impact the performance of our
model. We also plan on evaluating the model?s
performance on other genres of speech, as well as
in other tasks such as Machine Translation. We
are also working on scaling our model further to
accommodate amounts of data typical for mod-
ern large-scale ngram models. Finally, we plan to
apply the technique to other languages with tree-
banks, such as Chinese and Arabic.
We intend to release the source code of our
model within several months of this publication.
