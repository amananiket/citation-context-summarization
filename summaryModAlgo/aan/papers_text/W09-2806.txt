Abstract
In evaluation of automatic summaries, it
is necessary to employ multiple topics and
human-produced models in order for the
assessment to be stable and reliable. How-
ever, providing multiple topics and models
is costly and time-consuming. This paper
examines the relation between the number
of available models and topics and the cor-
relations with human judgment obtained
by automatic metrics ROUGE and BE, as
well as the manual Pyramid method. Test-
ing all these methods on the same data set,
taken from the TAC 2008 Summarization
track, allows us to compare and contrast
the methods under different conditions.
1 Introduction
Appropriate evaluation of results is an important
aspect of any research. In areas such as automatic
summarization, the problem is especially complex
because of the inherent subjectivity in the task it-
self and its evaluation. There is no single objective
standard for a good quality summary; rather, its
value depends on the summary?s purpose, focus,
and particular requirements of the reader (Sp?arck
Jones, 2007). While the purpose and focus can
be set as constant for a specific task, the variabil-
ity of human judgment is more difficult to con-
trol. Therefore, in attempts to produce stable eval-
uations, it has become standard to use multiple
judges, not necessarily for parallel evaluation, but
in such a way that each judge evaluates a differ-
ent subset of the many summaries on which the
final system assessment is based. The incorpora-
tion of multiple points of view is also reflected in
automatic evaluation, where it takes the form of
employing multiple model summaries to which a
candidate summary is compared.
Since these measures to neutralize judgment
variation involve the production of multiple model
summaries, as well as multiple topics, evaluation
can become quite costly. Therefore, it is inter-
esting to examine how many models and topics
are necessary to obtain a relatively stable eval-
uation, and whether this number is different for
manual and automatic metrics. In their exami-
nation of summary evaluations, van Halteren and
Teufel (2003) suggest that it is necessary to use
at least 30 to 40 model summaries for a stable
evaluation; however, Harman and Over (2004) ar-
gue that a stable evaluation can be conducted even
with a single model, as long as there is an ade-
quate number of topics. This view is supported by
Lin (2004a), who concludes that ?correlations to
human judgments were increased by using multi-
ple references but using single reference summary
with enough number of samples was a valid al-
ternative?. Interestingly, similar conclusions were
also reached in the area of Machine Translation
evaluation; in their experiments, Zhang and Vogel
(2004) show that adding an additional reference
translation compensates the effects of removing
10?15% of the testing data, and state that, there-
fore, ?it seems more cost effective to have more
test sentences but fewer reference translations?.
In this paper, we look at how various metrics
behave with respect to a variable number of top-
ics and models used in the evaluation. This lets us
determine the stability of individual metrics, and
helps to illuminate the trade-offs inherent in de-
signing a good evaluation. For our experiments,
we used data from the Summarization track at the
Text Analysis Conference (TAC) 2008, where par-
ticipating systems were assessed on their summa-
rization of 48 topics, and the automatic metrics
ROUGE and BE, as well as the manual Pyramid
evaluation method, had access to 4 human mod-
els. TAC 2008 was the first task of the TAC/DUC
(Document Understanding Conference) series in
which the Pyramid method was used on all evalu-
ated data, making it possible to conduct a full com-
23
parison among the manual and automatic meth-
ods. Despite the lack of full Pyramid evaluation
in DUC 2007, we look at the remaining metrics
applied that year (ROUGE, BE, and Content Re-
sponsiveness), in order to see whether they con-
firm the insights gained from the TAC 2008 data.
2 Summary evaluation
The main evaluation at TAC 2008 was performed
manually, assessing the automatic candidate sum-
maries with respect to Overall Responsiveness,
Overall Readability, and content coverage accord-
ing to the Pyramid framework (Nenkova and Pas-
sonneau, 2004; Passonneau et al, 2005). Task par-
ticipants were asked to produce two summaries for
each of the 48 topics; the first (initial summary)
was a straightforward summary of 10 documents
in response to a topic statement, which is a request
for information about a subject or event; the sec-
ond was an update summary, generated on the ba-
sis of another set of 10 documents, which followed
the first set in temporal order and described further
developments in the given topic. The idea behind
the update summary was to avoid repeating all the
information included in the first set of documents,
on the assumption that the reader is familiar with
that information already.
The participating teams submitted up to three
runs each; however, only the first and second
runs were evaluated manually due to limited re-
sources. For each summary under evaluation, as-
sessors rated the summary from 1 (very poor) to
5 (very good) in terms of Overall Responsiveness,
which measures how well the summary responds
to the need for information expressed in the topic
statement and whether its linguistic quality is ad-
equate. Linguistic qualities such as grammatical-
ity, coreference, and focus were also evaluated as
Overall Readability, also on the scale from 1 to
5. Content coverage of each summary was evalu-
ated using the Pyramid framework, where asses-
sors create a list of information nuggets (called
Summary Content Units, or SCUs) from the set of
human-produced summaries on a given topic, then
decide whether any of these nuggets are present in
the candidate summary. All submitted runs were
evaluated with the automatic metrics: ROUGE
(Lin, 2004b), which calculates the proportion of
n-grams shared between the candidate summary
and the reference summaries, and Basic Elements
(Hovy et al, 2005), which compares the candidate
to the models in terms of head-modifier pairs.
2.1 Manual metrics
Evaluating Overall Responsiveness and Overall
Readability is a rather straightforward procedure,
as most of the complex work is done in the mind
of the human assessor. Each candidate summary
is given a single score, and the final score for
the summarization system is the average of all its
summary-level scores. The only economic factor
here is the number of topics, i.e. summaries per
system, that need to be judged in order to neutral-
ize both intra- and inter-annotator variability and
obtain a reliable assessment of the summarization
system.
When it comes to the Pyramid method, which
measures content coverage of candidate sum-
maries, the need for multiple topics is accompa-
nied by the need for multiple human model sum-
maries. First, independent human assessors pro-
duce summaries for each topic, guided by the topic
statement. Next, in the Pyramid creation stage,
an assessor reads all human-produced summaries
for a given topic and extracts all ?information
nuggets?, called Summary Content Units (SCUs),
which are short, atomic statements of facts con-
tained in the text. Each SCU has a weight which
is directly proportional to the number of model
summaries in which it appears, on the assumption
that the fact?s importance is reflected in how many
human summarizers decide to include it as rele-
vant in their summary. Once all SCUs have been
harvested from the model summaries, an assessor
then examines each candidate summary to see how
many of the SCUs from the list it contains. The fi-
nal Pyramid score for a candidate summary is its
total SCU weight divided by the maximum SCU
weight available to a summary of average length
(where the average length is determined by the
mean SCU count of the model summaries for this
topic). The final score for a summarization system
is the average score of all its summaries. In TAC
2008, the evaluation was conducted with 48 topics
and 4 human models for each topic.
We examined to what extent the number of
models and topics used in the evaluation can in-
fluence the Pyramid score and its stability. The
stability, similarly to the method employed by
Voorhees and Buckley (2002) for Information Re-
trieval, is determined by how well a system rank-
ing based on a small number of models/topics cor-

relates with the ranking based on another set of
models/topics, where the two sets are randomly
selected and mutually exclusive. This methodol-
ogy allows us to check the correlations based on
up to half of the actual number of models/topics
only (because of the non-overlap requirement), but
it gives an indication of the general tendency. We
also look at the correlation between the Pyramid
score and Overall Responsiveness. We don?t ex-
pect a perfect correlation between Pyramid and
Responsiveness in the best of times, because Pyra-
mid measures content identity between the can-
didate and the model, and Responsiveness mea-
sures content relevance to topic as well as linguis-
tic quality. However, the degree of variation be-
tween the two scores depending on the number of
models/topics used for the Pyramid will give us
a certain indication of the amount of information
lost.
2.2 Automatic metrics
Similarly to the Pyramid method, ROUGE (Lin,
2004b) and Basic Elements (Hovy et al, 2005)
require multiple topics and model summaries to
produce optimal results. ROUGE is a collection
of automatic n-gram matching metrics, ranging
from unigram to four-gram. It also includes mea-
surements of the longest common subsequence,
weighted or unweighted, and the option to com-
pare stemmed versions of words and omit stop-
words. There is also the possibility of accept-
ing skip-n-grams, that is, counting n-grams as
matching even if there are some intervening non-
matching words. The skip-n-grams together with
stemming are the only ways ROUGE can acco-
modate alternative forms of expression and match
concepts even though they might differ in terms of
their syntactic or lexical form.
These methods are necessarily limited, and so
ROUGE relies on using multiple parallel model
summaries which serve as a source of lexi-
cal/syntactic variation in the comparison process.
The fewer models there are, the less reliable the
score. Our question here is not only what this rela-
tion looks like (as it was examined on the basis of
Document Understanding Conference data in Lin
(2004a)), but also how it compares to the reliabil-
ity of other metrics.
Basic Elements (BE), on the other hand, goes
beyond simple string matching and parses the syn-
tactic structure of the candidate and model to ob-
tain a set of head-modifier pairs for each, and then
compares the sets. A head-modifier pair consist of
the head of a syntactic unit (e.g. the noun in a noun
phrase), and the word which modifes the head (i.e.
a determiner in a noun phrase). It is also possible
to include the name of the relation which connects
them (i.e. subject, object, etc.). Since BEs reflect
thematic relations in a sentence rather than surface
word order, it should be possible to accommodate
certain differences of expression that might appear
between a candidate summary and a reference, es-
pecially as the words can be stemmed. This could,
in theory, allow us to use fewer models for the
evaluation. In practice, however, it fails to account
for the total possible variety, and, what is more,
25
the additional step of parsing the text can intro-
duce noise into the comparison.
TAC 2008 and DUC 2007 evaluations used
ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-SU4, which refer to the
recall of bigram and skip-bigram (with up to 4 in-
tervening words) matches on stemmed words, re-
spectively, as well as a BE score calculated on the
basis of stemmed head-modifier pairs without re-
lation labels. Therefore, these are the versions we
use in our comparisons.
3 Number of models
Since Responsiveness score does not depend on
the number of models, it serves as a reference
against which we compare the remaining metrics,
while we calculate their score with only 1, 2, 3, or
all 4 models. Given 48 topics in TAC 2008, and
4-model summaries for each topic, there are 4
48
possible combinations to derive the final score in
the single-model category, so to keep the experi-
ments simple we only selected 1000 random sam-
ples from that space. For 1000 repetitions, each
time we selected a random combination of model
summaries (only one model out of 4 available per
topic), against which we evaluated the candidate
summaries. Then, for each of the 1000 samples,
we calculated the correlation between the result-
ing score and Responsiveness. We then took the
1000 correlations produced in this manner, and
computed their mean. In the same way, we cal-
culated the scores based on 2 and 3 model sum-
maries, randomly selected from the 4 available for
each topic. The correlation means for all metrics
and categories are given in Table 1 for initial sum-
maries and Table 2 for update summaries. We also
ran a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) on
these correlations to determine whether the cor-
relation means were significantly different from
each other. For the 4-model category there was
only one possible sample for each metric, so in or-
der to perform ANOVA we bootstrapped this sam-
ple to produce 1000 samples. The actual value of
the 4-model correlation is given in the tables as 4
(actual), and the mean value of the bootstrapped
1000 correlations is given as 4 (bootstr).
Values for initial summaries are significantly
different from their counterparts for update sum-
maries at the 95% level. Pairwise testing of values
for statistically significant differences is shown
with symbols: in each column, the first value
marked with a particular symbol is not signifi-
cantly different from any subsequent value marked
with the same symbol.
We also examined the correlations of the met-
rics with the 4-model Pyramid score. Table 3
presents the correlation means for the initial sum-
maries, and Table 4 shows the correlation means
for the update summaries.
Since the Pyramid, contrary to Responsiveness,
makes use of multiple model summaries, we ex-
amine its stability given a decreased number of
models to rely on. For this purpose, we correlated
the Pyramid score based on randomly selected 2
models (half of the model pool) for each topic with
the score based on the remaining 2 models, and
repeated this 1000 times. We also looked at the
1-model category, where the Pyramid score cal-
culated on the basis of one model per topic was
correlated with the Pyramid score calculated on
the basis on another randomly selected model. In
both case we witness a very high mean correlation:
0.994 and 0.995 for the 2-model category, 0.982
and 0.985 for the 1-model category for TAC initial
and update summaries, respectively. As an illus-
tration, Figure1 shows the variance of correlations
for the initial summaries.
Figure 1: Correlations between Pyramid scores based on 1
or 2 model summaries for TAC 2008 initial summaries.
The variation in correlation levels between
other metrics and Pyramid and Responsiveness,
presented in Tables 3?4, is more visible in the
graph form. Figures 2-3 illustrate the mean
correlation values for TAC 2008 initial sum-
maries. While all the metrics record the steep-
est increase in correlation values with the addi-
tion of the second model, adding the third and
fourth model provides the metrics with smaller
but steady improvement, with the exception of
Pyramid-Responsiveness correlation in Figure 2.
The increase in correlation mean is most dramatic
for BE, which in all cases starts as the lowest-
26
correlating metric in the single-model category,
but by the 4-model point it outperforms one or
both versions of ROUGE. The Pyramid metric
achieves significantly higher correlations than any
other metric, independent of the number of mod-
els, which is perhaps unsurprising given that it is a
manual evaluation method. Of the two ROUGE
versions, ROUGE-2 seems consistently a better
predictor of both Responsiveness and the ?full? 4-
model Pyramid score than ROUGE-SU4.

4 models for TAC 2008 initial summaries.
Figure 3: 4-model Pyramid vs. other metrics with 1, 2, 3,
or 4 models for TAC 2008 initial summaries.
Similar patterns appear in DUC 2007 data (Ta-
ble 5), despite the fact that the Overall Respon-
siveness of TAC 2008 is replaced with Content Re-
sponsiveness (ignoring linguistic quality), against
which we calculate all the correlations. Although
the increase in correlation means from 1- to 4-
models for the three automatic metrics is smaller
than for TAC 2008, the clearest rise occurs with
the addition of a second model, especially for BE,
and the subsequent additions change little. As in
the case of initial summaries 2008, ROUGE-2 out-
performs the remaining two metrics independently
of the number of models. However, most of the in-
creases are too small to be significant.
This comparison suggests diminishing returns

with the addition of more models, as well as dif-
ferent reactions among the metrics to the presence
or absence of additional models. When correlating
with Responsiveness, the manual Pyramid metric
benefits very little from the fourth model, but au-
tomatic BE benefits most from almost every addi-
tion. ROUGE is situated somewhere between the
two, noting small but often significant increases.
On the whole, the use of multiple models (at least
two) seems supported, especially if we use auto-
matic metrics in our evaluation.
4 Number of topics
For the second set of experiments we kept all four
models, but varied the number of topics which
went into the final average system score. To deter-
mine the stability of Responsiveness and Pyramid
we looked at the correlations between the scores
based on smaller sets of topics. For 1000 rep-
etitions, we calculated Pyramid/Responsiveness
score based on a set of 1, 3, 6, 12, or 24 topics ran-
domly chosen from the pool of 48, and compared
the system ranking thus created with the ranking
based on another, equally sized set, such that the
sets did not contain common topics. Table 6 shows
the mean correlation for each case. Although such
comparison was only possible up to 24 topics (half
of the whole available topic pool), the numbers
suggest that at the level of 48 topics both Respon-
siveness and Pyramid are stable enough to serve as
reference for the automatic metrics.

39, 42, or 45. Within each of these categories, for
a thousand repetitions, we calculated the score for
automatic summarizers by averaging over n topics
randomly selected from the pool of 48 topics avail-
able in the evaluation. Again, we examined the
correlations between the metrics and the ?full? 48-
topic Responsiveness and Pyramid. As previously,
we then used ANOVA to determine whether the
correlation means differed significantly. Because
there was only one possible sample with all 48
topics for each metric, we bootstrapped this sam-
ple to provide 1000 new samples in the 48-topic
category, in order to perfom the ANOVA compari-
son of variance. Tables 7 and 8, as well as Figures
4 and 5, show the metrics? changing correlations
with Responsiveness. Tables 9 and 10, and Fig-
ures 6 and 7, show the correlations with the 48-
topic Pyramid score. Values for initial summaries
are significantly different from their counterparts
for update summaries at the 95% level.
In all cases, it becomes clear that the curves flat-
ten out and the correlations stop increasing almost
completely beyond the 36-topic mark. This means
that the scores for the automatic summarization
systems based on 36 topics will be on average
practically indistiguishable from the scores based
on all 48 topics, showing that beyond a certain
minimally necessary number of topics adding or
removing a few (or even ten) topics will not influ-
ence the system scores much. (However, we can-
not conclude that a further considerable increase in
the number of topics ? well beyond 48 ? would not
bring more improvement in the correlations, per-
haps increasing the stable ?correlation window? as
well.)

An interesting observation is that if we pro-

all 48 topics, it appears that they are less stable
than the automatic metrics, i.e. there is a larger
gap between the worst and best correlations they
achieve.

The mean correlation between the ?full?
Responsiveness and that based on 1 topic is 0.443
and 0.448 for the initial and update summaries, re-
spectively; for that based on 3 topics, 0.664 and
0.667. Pyramid based on 1 topic achieves 0.467
for initial and 0.525 for update summaries; Pyra-
mid based on 3 topics obtains 0.690 and 0.742,
respectively. Some of these values, especially
for update summaries, are even lower than those
obtained by ROUGE in the same category, de-
spite the fact that 1- and 3-topic Responsiveness or
Pyramid is a proper subset of the 48-topic Respon-
siveness/Pyramid. On the other hand, ROUGE
achieves considerably worse correlations with Re-
sponsiveness than Pyramid when there are many
topics available. ROUGE-SU4 seems to be more
stable than ROUGE-2; in all cases ROUGE-2
starts with lower correlations than ROUGE-SU4,
but by the 12-topic mark its correlations increase

above it.
Additionally, despite being an automatic metric,
BE seems to follow the same pattern as the manual
metrics. It is seriously affected by the decreasing
number of topics; in fact, if the number of topics
drops below 24, BE is the least reliable indicator
of either Responsiveness or Pyramid. However,
by the 48-topic mark it rises to levels comparable
with ROUGE-2.
As in the case of models, DUC 2007 data shows
mostly the same pattern as TAC 2008. Again, in
this data set, the increase in the correlation mean
with the addition of topics for each metric are
smaller than for either initial or update summaries
in TAC 2008, but the relative rate of increase re-
mains the same: BE gains most from additional
topics (+0.28 in DUC vs. +0.47 and +0.51 in
TAC), ROUGE-SU4 again shows the smallest in-
crease (+0.19 in DUC vs. +0.36 and +0.34 in
TAC), which means it is the most stable of the met-
rics across the variable number of topics.

The smaller total increase might be due to the smaller
number of available topics (45 in DUC vs. 48 in TAC), but
we have seen the same effect in Section 3 while discussing
models, so it might just be an accidental property of a given
data set.

5 Discussion and conclusions
As the popularity of shared tasks increases, task
organizers face an ever growing problem of pro-
viding an adequate evaluation to all participating
teams. Often, evaluation of multiple runs from the
same team is required, as a way to foster research
and development. With more and more system
submissions to judge, and the simultaneous need
for multiple topics and models in order to provide
a stable assessment, difficult decisions of cutting
costs and effort might sometimes be necessary. It
would be useful then to know where such deci-
sions will have the smallest negative impact, or at
least, what might be the trade-offs inherent in such
decisions.
From our experiments, it appears that manual
metrics such as Pyramid gain less from the addi-
tion of more model summaries than the automatic
metrics. A Pyramid score based on any two mod-
els correlates very highly with the score based on
any other two models. For the automatic metrics,
the largest gain is recorded with adding the sec-
ond model; afterwards the returns diminish. BE
seems to be the most sensitive metric to changes in
the number of models and topics; ROUGE-SU4,
on the other hand, is the least sensitive to such
changes and the most stable, but it does not ob-
tain the highest correlations when many models
and topics are available.
Whatever the number of models, manual Pyra-
mid considerably outperforms automatic metrics,
as can be expected, since human understanding is
not hampered by the possible differences in sur-
face expression between a candidate and a model.
But when it comes to decreased number of topics,
the inherent variability of human judgment shows
strongly, to the extent that, in extreme cases of
very few topics, it might be more prudent to use
ROUGE-SU4 than Pyramid or Responsiveness.
Lastly, we observe that, as with models, adding
one or two topics to the evaluation plays a great
role only if we have very few topics to start with.
Our experiments suggest that, as the number of
topics available for evaluation increases, so does
the number of additional topics necessary to make
a difference in the system ranking produced by
a metric. It seems that in the case of evaluation
based on 48 topics, as in the TAC Summarization
track, it would be possible to decrease the number
to about 36 without sacrificing much stability.
