Abstract 
In this paper, we review Dale's \[1989\] algorithm 
for determining the content of a referring expres- 
sion. The algorithm, which only permits the use 
of one-place predicates, is revised and extended 
to deal with n-ary predicates. We investigate the 
problem of blocking 'recursion' in complex noun 
phrases and propose a solution in the context of 
our algorithm. 
Introduction 
In very simple language generation systems, there 
is typically a one-to-one relationship between en- 
tities known to the system and the linguistic forms 
available for describing those entities; in effect, 
each entity has a canonical name. In such sys- 
tems, deciding upon the form of reference r quired 
in a given context requires at most choosing be- 
twc(,n a pronoun and the canonical name. 1
As soon as a generation system has access to a 
knowledge base which contains richer knowledge 
about the entities in the domain, the system has 
to face the problem of deciding what particular 
properties of an entity should be used in describ- 
ing it in a given context? Producing a descrip- 
tion which includes all of the known properties 
of Lhe entity is likely to be both inefficient and 
t~.Ve do not  mean to imply,  of  course,  that  the  de- 
c is ion as to whether  or not  to use a pronoun is s imple .

The core of the problem is finding a way of de- 
scribing the intended referent hat distinguishes 
it from other potential referents with which it 
might be confused. We refer to this problem as 
the content determinat ion task. In this paper, 
we point out some limitations in an earlier solu- 
tion proposed in Dale \[1988, 1989\], and discuss 
the possibilites of extending this solution by in- 
corporating a use of constraints motivated by the 
work of Haddock \[1987, 1988\]. 
Generating Referring 
Expressions 
The Pr inc ip les  o f  Re ference  
Dale \[1988, 1989\] presents a solution to the con- 
tent determination task which is motivated by 
three principles of refcrence. These are cssen- 
tinily Gricean conversational maxims rephrased 
from the perspective of generating referring ex- 
pressions: 
1. The principle of sensit ivity states that the 
referring expression chosen should take account 
of the state af the hearer's knowledge. 
2. The principle of adequacy states that the 
referring expression chosen should be sufficient 
to identify the intended referent. 
3. The principle of efficiency states that the 
referring expression chosen should provide no 
more information than is necessary for the iden- 
tification of the intended referent. 
The solution proposed in Dale \[1988, 1989\] fo- 
cuses on the second and third of these principles 
of reference as constraints on the content deter- 
mination task.

Dis t ingu ish ing  Descr ip t ions  
Other researchers ( ee, for example, \[Davey 1978; 
Appclt 1985a\]) have suggested that the process 
ol: determining the content of a referring expres- 
sion should be governed by principles like those 
just described. Detailed algorithms for satisfying 
these requirements are rarely provided, however. 
Suppose that we have a set of entities C (called 
the context  set)  such that C = {a l ,a2 , . . . ,an}  
and our task is to distinguish from this context set 
some intended referent r where r E C. Suppose, 
also, that each entity ak is described in the sys- 
tem's knowledge base by means of a set of prop- 
ertics, pk~, Pk2, ? ? ?, Pk,,. 
In order to distinguish our intended referent r
from the other entities in C, we need to find some 
set of properties which are together true of r, but 
of no other entity in C. 3 The linguistic realisa- 
tion of this set of properties constitutes a d ist in-  
gu ish ing  descr ip t ion  (DD) of r with respect o 
the context C. A min ima l  d i s t ingu ish ing  de- 
sc r ip t ion  is then the linguistic realisation of the 
smallest such set of properties. 
An  A lgor i thm to  Compute  
D is t ingu ish ing  Descr ip t ions  
I,eL Lr be the set of properties to be realised in 
our description; and let t~ be the set of proper- 
tics known to be true of our intended referent r
(we assume that Dr is non-empty). The initial 
conditions are thus as follows: 
? C,. = {(all entities in the knowledge base)}; 
? Pr = {(all properties true of r)}; 
? 
In order to describe the intended referent r with 
respect o the context set Cr, we do the following: 
1. Check Success 
if \[Cr I = 1 then  return Lr as a DD 
elsei f  Pr = 0 then  return Lr as a non-DD 
else goto  Step 2. 
"2. Choose Property 
for each  Pi E P~ do: Cr, ~-- C~ f3 {x\]pi(x)} 
Chosen property is pj, where Crj is the small- 
(;st se t f  
goto  Step 3. 
3A sirnilar approach is being pursued by Leavitt 
(personal communication) at CMU. 
4In the terminology of Dale \[1988, 1989\], this is 
equivalent o finding the property with the greatest 
discriminatory power. 
. Extend Description (wrt the chosen pj) 
Lr *-- L rU {pj} 
P~ *-- Pr - {Pj} 
goto  Step 1. 
If we have a distinguishing description, a definite 
determiner can be used, since the intended refer- 
ent is described uniquely in context. If the result 
is:a non-distinguishing description, all is not lost: 
we can realise the description by means of a noun 
phrase of the form one of the Xs, where X is the 
realisation of the properties in Lr. 5 For simplic- 
ity, the remainder of this paper concentrates on 
the generation of distinguishing descriptions only; 
the extended algorithm presented later will sim- 
ply fail if it is not possible to produce a DD. 
The abstract process described above requires 
some slight modifications before it can be used 
effectively for noun phrase generation. In partic- 
ular, we should note that, in noun phrases, the 
head noun typically appears even in cases where 
it does not have any discriminatory power. For 
example, suppose there are six entities on a table, 
all of which are cups although only one is red: we 
are then likely to describe that particular cup as 
as the red cup rather than simply the red or the 
red thing. Thus, in order to implement the above 
algorithm, we always first add to L that property 
of the entity that would typically be denoted by 
a head noun. ? In many cases, this means that no 
further properties need be added. 
Note also that Step 2 of our algorithm is non- 
deterministic, in that several properties may inde- 
pendently ield a context set of the same minimal 
size. For simplicity, we assume that one of these 
equally viable properties is chosen at random. 
Some Prob lems 
There are some problems with the algorithm just 
described. 
As Reiter \[1990:139\] has pointed out, the algo- 
rithm does not guarantee to find a minimal dis- 
tinguishing description: this is equivalent o the 
minimal set cover problem and is thus intractable 
as stated. 
Second, the mechanism doesn't necessarily pro- 
duce a useful description: consider the example 
SOne might be tempted to suggest hat a straight- 
forward indefinite, as in an X, could be used in such 
cases; this is typically not what people do, however. 
SFor simplicity, we can assume that this is that 
property of the entity that would be denoted by what 
P~sch \[1978\] calls the entity's basic category.

offered by Appelt \[1985b:6\], where a speaker tells 
a hearer (whom she has just met on the bus) 
which bus stop to get off at by saying Get off one 
stop before I do. This may be a uniquely iden- 
tifying description of the intended referent, but 
it is of little use without a supplementary offer 
to indicate the stop; ultimately, we require some 
computational treatment of the Principle of Sen- 
sitivity here. 
Third, as has been demonstrated by work in 
psycholinguistics (for a recent summary, see Lev- 
elt \[1989:129-13d\]), the algorithm does not rep- 
resent what people seem to do when construct- 
ing a referring expression: in particular, people 
typically produce referring expressions which are 
redundant (over and above the inclusion of the 
head noun as discussed above). This fact can, of 
course, be taken to nullify the impact of the first 
problem described above. 
We do not intend to address any of these prob- 
lems in the present paper. Instead, we consider an 
extension of our basic algorithm to deal with rela- 
tions, and focus on an orthogonal problem which 
besets any algorithm for generating DDS involving 
relations. 
Relat ions and the Problem of 
'Recursion' 
Suppose that our knowledge base consists of a set 
of facts, as follows: 
{cup(c\]), cup(c2), cup(c3), bowl(bx), bowl(b2), 
table(t\]), table(t2), floor(I\] ), in(cl, bl), 
in(c2, b2), on(c3, fl), on(b\], fl), on(b2, Q), 
on(t \ ] , f l ) ,on(t~,f l )} 
Thus we have three cups, two bowls, two tables 
and a floor: Cup c\] is in bowl bl, and bowl b\] 
is on the floor, as are the tables and cup ca; and 
so on. The algorithm described above deals only 
with one-place predicates, and says nothing about 
using relations such as on(bl,fl) as part of a 
distinguishing description. How can we extend 
tile basic algorithm to handle relations? It turns 
out that this is not as simple as it might seem: 
problems arise because of the potential for infinite 
regress in the construction of the description. 
A natural strategy to adopt for generating ex- 
prcssions with relations is that used by Appelt 
\[1985a:108-112\]. For example, to describe the 
entity c3, our planner might determine that the 
predicate to be realized in our referring expres- 
sion is the abstraction Ax\[cup(x)Aon(x, f l ) \ ] ,  since 
this complex predicate is true of only one entity, 
namely ca. In Appelt's TELEGRAM, this results 
first in the choice of the head noun cup, followed 
by a recursive call to the planner to determine 
how fl  should be described. The resulting noun 
phrase is then the cup on the floor. 
In many cases this approach will do what is 
required. However, in certain situations, it will 
attempt o describe a referent in terms of itself 
and generate an infinite description. 
For example, consider a very specific instance 
of the problem, which arises in a scenario f the 
kind discussed in Haddock \[1987, 19881 from the 
perspective of interpretation. Such a scenario is 
characterised in the above knowledge base: we 
have two bowls and two tables, and one of the 
bowls is on one of the tables. Given this situa- 
tion, it is felicitous to refer to b~ as the bowl on 
the table. However, the use of the definite arti- 
cle in the embedded NP the table poses a problem 
for purely compositional pproaches to interpre- 
tation, which would expect he embedded NP to 
refer uniquely in isolation. 
Naturally, this same scenario will be problem- 
atic for a purely compositional pproach to gen- 
eration of the kind alluded to at the beginning of 
this section. Taken literally, this algorithm could 
generate an infinite NP, such as: z 
the  bowl on the table which supports the bowl 
on the  tab le  which supports ... 
Below, we present an algorithm for generating 
relational descriptions which deals with this spe- 
cific instance of the problem of repetition. Had- 
dock \[1988\] observes the problem can be solved 
by giving both determiners scope over the entire 
NP, thus: 
(3tx)(:l!y)bowl(m) A on(x, y) A table(y) 
In Haddock's model of interpretation, this treat- 
ment falls out of a scheme of incremental, left-to- 
right reference valuation based on an incremen- 
tal accumulation of constraints. Our generation 
algorithm follows Haddock \[1988\], and Mellish 
\[1985\], in using constraint-network consistency to
determine the entities relating to a description 
(see Mackworth \[1977\]). This is not strictly nec- 
essary, since any evaluation procedure such as 
generate-and-test or backtracking, can produce 
the desired result; however, using network consis- 
tency provides a natural evolution of the existing 
algorithm, since this already models the problem 
in terms of incremental refinement ofcontext sets. 
?We Ignore the question of determiner choice in the 
present paper, and assume for simplicity that definite 
determiners are chosen here. 
- 163  - 
We conclude the paper by investigating the im- 
plications of our approach for the more general 
problem of recursive repetition. 
A Const ra in t -Based  A lgor i thm 
Data  St ructures  
We assume three global kinds of data structure. 
1. The Referent  S tack  is a stack of referents we 
are trying to describe. Initially this stack is set 
to contain just the top-level referent: s 
\[Describe(b2, x)\] 
This means that the goal is to describe the ref- 
erent b2 in terms of predicates over the variable 
X. 
2. The Proper ty  Set for the intended referent 
r is the set of facts, or predications, in the 
knowledge base relating to r; we will notate 
this as Pr. For example, given the knowledge 
base introduced in the previous section, the 
floor f l  has the following Property Set: 
PA = {floor(f1), on(e3,/1), on(b1,/1), 
on(tl, f l) ,  on(t2, f l )  } 
3. A Const ra in t  Network  N will be viewed ab- 
stractly as a pair consisting of (a) a set of con- 
straints, which corresponds to our description 
L, and (b) the context sets for the variables 
mentioned in L. The following is an example 
of a constraint network, viewed in these terms: 
i.(x, u)}, 
{c: = {ca, = {bl, b2}\]) 
The A lgor i thm 
For brevity, our algorithm uses the notation N~p 
to signify the result of adding the constraint p 
to the network N. Whenever a constraint p is 
added to a network, assume the following actions 
occur: (a) p is added to the set of constraints 
L; and (b) the context sets for variables in L are 
refined until their values are consistent with the 
new constraint. 9 Assume that every variable is 
~\Ve represent  he  s tack  here as a list, w i th  the  top 
of  the  s tack  be ing  the  le f t -most  i tem in the  list. 
9We do not  address  the  degree of network  consis-  
tency  requ i red  by our  a lgor i thm.  However,  for the 
examples  t reated  in th is  paper ,  a node and  arc  con- 
s i s tcncy  a lgor i thm,  such  as Mackwor th ' s  \[1977\] AC-  
3, will suffice. (Haddock  \[1991\] invest igates  the  suffi- 
c iency of  such  low-power  techn iques  for noun  phrase  
in terpreta t ion . )  We assume that  our  a lgor i thm han-  
dles constants  as well as var iab les  w i th in  const ra in ts .  
initially associated with a context set containing 
all entities in the knowledge base. 
In addition, we use the notation It\r ip to sig- 
nify the result of replacing every occurence of the 
constant r in p by the variable v. For instance, 
\[c3\x\]on(c3, f l )  = on(x, f l )  
The initial conditions are as follows: 
? Stack = \[Describe(r,v)\] 
? Pr = {(all facts true of r)} 
? N = ({}, \[C. = {(all entities)}\]) 
Thus, initially there are no properties in L. As 
before, the problem of finding a description L in- 
volves three steps which are repeated until a suc- 
cessful description has been constructed: 
1. We first check whether the description we have 
constructed so far is successful in picking out 
the intended referent. 
2. If the description is not sufficient to pick out 
the intended referent, we choose the most use- 
ful fact that will contribute to the description. 
3. We then extend the description with a con- 
straint representing this fact, and add Describe 
goals for any constants relating to the con- 
straint. 
The essential use of constraints occurs in Step 2 
and 3; the detail of the revised algorithm is shown 
in Figure 1. 
An  Example  
There is insufficient space to go through an exam- 
ple in detail here; however, we summarise some 
steps for the problematic ase of referring to b2 as 
the the bowl on the table. 1? For simplicity here, 
we assume our algorithm will always choose the 
head category first. Thus, we have the following 
constraint network after one iteration through the 
algorithm: 
N = ({bowl(x)}, \[Cx = {bl, b~}\]) 
Let  us suppose that the second iteration chooses 
on(b2, t l)  as the predication with which to extend 
our description. When integrated into the con- 
straint network, we have 
l ?Aga in ,  we ignore the  quest ion  of  determiner  choice 
and  assume def in i tes  are chosen.

Note that in Steps 1, 2 and 3, r and v relate to the 
current Describe(r, v) on top of the stack.

Note that the network has determined a set for

ca.llse it is not known to support anything.

Ahcr adding this new constraint, f l  is eliminated 
I'rt)nl ~y. This leads to the revision of to Cx, 
which must remove every vahm which is not on 
I i .  
On the fourth iteration, we exit with the first 
corn p,ment of this network, L, as our description; 
w(: can then realize this content as the bowl on 
ll., lath'. 
The Prob lem Rev is i ted  
The task of referring to b2 in our knowledge base 
is something of a special case, and does not illus- 
trate the nature of the general problem of recur- 
sion. Consider the task of referring to el. Due 
to the non-determinism in Step 2, our algorithm 
might either generate the DD corresponding to the 
cup in the bowl on the floor, or it might instead 
get into an infinite loop corresponding to the cup 
in the bowl containing the cup in the bowl con- 
taining . . .  The initial state of the referent slack 
and O's property set will be: 
Stack = \[Describe(cl,z)\] 
P~ = {cup(o), in(cl ,bi)} 
At the beginning of the fourth iteration the al- 
gorithm will have produced a partial description 
corresponding to the cup in the bowl, with the 
top-level goal to uniquely distinguish bl: 
Stack = \[Describe(bt,y), Describe(ca,x)\] 
Pc, = O 
Pb, = { in (o ,b l ) ,on(b l , f l )}  
N = ({cup(x),in(x,y),bowl(y)}, 
to= = {cl,o~},C~ = {b, ,b~) \ ] )  
Step 2 of the fourth iteration computes two net- 
works, for the two facts in Pb, : 
Nl = N ~ in(o ,y )  
= ({cup(x), in(x,y), bowl(y),in(cl, y)}, 
\[c~ = {cx }, c~ = {b, }l) 
N2 = N ~on(y ,  f l )  
= ({cup(x), in(x, y), bowl(y), on(y, f l )} ,  
\[c= = {c,},c, = {b,}\]> 
Since both networks yield singleton sets lbr Cu, 
the algorithm might choose the property in(el, bl). 
This means extending the current description with 
a constraint in(z,y), and stacking an additional 
commitment to describe cl in terms of the vari- 
able z. Hence at the end of the fourth iteration, 
the algorithm is in the state 
Stack = \[Oescribe(cl,z),Describe(bl,y), 
Describe(o, x)\] 
P~,, = 0 
ebl = {on(bl, f l )}  
Pea. = {cup(o) , in (c l ,b , )}  
N = ({cup(x), in(x,y),bowl(y), in(z,y)}, 
\[...\]) 
and may continue to loop in this manner. 
The general problem of inlinite repetition has 
been noted before in the generation literature. 
For example, Novak \[1988:83\] suggests that 
- 165  - 
\[i\]f a two-place predicate is lined to generate the 
rc.~trictive relative clause, the second object of 
this predicate ischaracterized simply by its prop- 
crties to avoid recursivc reference as in the car 
which was overtaken by the truck which overtook 
the car. 
Davey \[1979\], on the other hand, introduces 
the notion of a CANLIST (the Currently Active 
Node List) for those entities which have already 
been mentioned in the noun phrase currently un- 
der construction. The generator is then prohib- 
ited from describing an cntity in tetras of entities 
already in the CANLIST. 
in the general case, these proposals appear to 
b(: too strong. Davey's restriction would seem 
t.o b(: the weaker of the two, but if taken liter- 
ally, it will nevertheless prevent legitimate cases 
of bound-variable anaphora within an NP, such as 
the mani who ale the cake which poisoned himi. 
We suggest he following, possibly more general 
heuristic: do not express a given piece of infor- 
mation more than once within the same NP. For 
our simplified representation f contextual knowl- 
c.dgc, exernplified above, we could encode this 
heuristic by stipulating that any fact in the knowl- 
edge base can only be chosen once within a given 
call to the algorithm. So in the above example, 
once the relation in(el, bl) has been chosen from 
the initial set \ [~, - - in  order to constrain the vari- 
able x---it is no longer available as a viable con- 
textual constraint to distinguish b~ later on. This 
heuristic will therefore block the infinite descrip- 
tion of cl. But as desired, it will admit the bound- 
variable anaphora mentioned above, since this NP 
is not based on repeated inforrnation; the phrase 
it mcrcly self-referential. 
Conclus ion 
Wc have shown how tile referring expression gen- 
eration algorithm presented in Dale \[1988, 1989\] 
can bc extended to encompass the use of rela- 
tions, by making use of constraint network con- 
sistency. In the context of this revised genera- 
tion procedure we have investigated the problem 
of blocking the production of infinitely recursive 
noun phrase,  and suggested an improvement on 
some existing approaches to the problem. Ar- 
eas lbr further research include the relationship 
of our approach to existing algorithms in other 
fields, such as machine learning, and also its re- 
lationship to observed characteristics of human 
discourse production.
