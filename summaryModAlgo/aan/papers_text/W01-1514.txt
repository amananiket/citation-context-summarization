Abstract 
Annotation graphs and annotation 
servers offer infrastructure to support 
the analysis of human language 
resources in the form of time-series 
data such as text, audio and video. This 
paper outlines areas of common need 
among empirical linguists and 
computational linguists. After 
reviewing examples of data and tools 
used or under development for each of 
several areas, it proposes a common 
framework for future tool development, 
data annotation and resource sharing 
based upon annotation graphs and 
servers. 
1 Introduction 
Despite different methodologies, goals and 
traditions, researchers in a variety of specialties 
in linguistics and computational linguistics share 
a core of assumptions and needs. Research 
communities in empirical linguistics, natural 
language processing, speech recognition, 
information retrieval and language teaching 
have a common need for language resources 
such as observations of linguistic performance, 
annotations encoding human judgment, 
standards for maintaining consistency among 
distributed resources and processes for 
extracting relevant observations. Where needs 
overlap, there is the opportunity to reuse 
existing resources and coordinate new initiatives 
so that communities share the burden of 
development while benefiting from the results. 
Where computational linguistics interacts with 
other areas of language research and teaching, 
there are additional opportunities for symbiosis. 
Natural language technology may offer greater 
access and robustness to empirical linguistic 
research that in turn may offer new data 
necessary to develop new technologies. This 
paper discusses common infrastructure for the 
annotation of linguistic data and the application 
of that infrastructure to several traditionally very 
diverse fields of inquiry.  
2 Common Assumptions, Needs and 
Goals in Natural Language Studies 
Human language resources, expensive to 
create and maintain, are in increasing demand 
among a growing number of research 
communities. One solution to this expanding 
need is to reannotate and reuse language 
resources created for other purposes. The now 
classic example is that of the Switchboard-1 
Corpus (ISBN: 1-58563-121-3), a collection of 
2400 two-sided telephone conversations among 
543 U.S. speakers, created by Texas Instruments 
in 1991. Although collected for speaker 
identification and topic spotting research, 
Switchboard has been widely used to support 
large vocabulary conversational speech 
recognition. It has been extensively corrected 
twice, once at Penn and NIST, and once at 
Mississippi State. Two excerpts have been 
published as test corpora for government-
sponsored projects. At least 6 other annotations 
have been created at various times and more-or-
less widely distributed among research sites: 
part-of-speech annotation (Penn); syntactic 
structure annotation (Penn); dysfluency 
annotation (Penn); partial phonetic transcription 
(independently at UCLA and at Berkeley); and 
discourse function annotation (Colorado). These 
annotations use different ?editions? of the 
underlying corpus and have sometimes silently 
introduced their own corrections or modified the 
data format to suit their needs. Thus the 
Colorado discourse function annotation was 
based on phrase structures introduced by the 
Penn dysfluency annotation, which in turn was 
based on the Penn/NIST corrections, which in 
turn were based on the original TI transcriptions 
of the underlying (and largely unchanging) 
audio files. Switchboard and its derivatives 
remain in active use worldwide, and new 
derivatives continue to be produced, along with 
(published and unpublished) corrections of old 
ones. This worsens the already acute problem of 
establishing and maintaining coherent relations 
among the derivatives in common use today. 
The Switchboard-1 case is by no means 
isolated (Graff & Bird 2000). The Topic 
Detection and Tracking Corpus, TDT-2 (ISBN: 
1-58563-157-4) was created in 1998 by LDC 
and contains newswire and more than 600 hours 
of transcribed broadcast news from 8 English 
and 3 Chinese sources sampled daily over six 
months with annotations to indicate story 
boundaries and relevance of those stories to 100 
randomly selected topics. Since its release, 
TDT-2 has been used as training, development-
test and evaluation data in the TDT evaluations; 
the audio has been used in TREC SDR 
evaluations (Garofalo, Auzanne and Voorhees 
2000), TDT text has been partially re-annotated 
for entity detection in the Automatic Content 
Extraction project (Przybocki 2000) and 
portions have been used for the Center for 
Spoken Language Processing?s workshops in 
Novel Information Detection (Allan et. al. 
1999), Mandarin-English Information (Meng et. 
al. 2000) and Audio-Visual Speech Recognition 
(Chalapati 2000). 
Switchboard and TDT are just two examples 
of a growing trend toward reannotation and 
reuse of language resources, a trend that is not 
limited to language engineering. Miller and 
Walker (2001) have demonstrated the value of 
the CALLHOME German corpus (ISBN: 1-
58563-117-5), developed to support speech 
recognition research, for language teaching. 
Deckert & Yaeger-Dror (2000) have used 
Switchboard to study regional syntactic 
variation in American English. 
Reannotation and reuse of linguistic data 
highlight the need for common infrastructure to 
support resource development across disciplines 
and specialties. 
3 Overlaps between Human Language 
Technology and Other Linguistic 
Research 
Many specialties in empirical linguistics and 
language engineering require large volumes of 
language data and tools for browsing and 
searching the data efficiently. The sections that 
follow provide examples of recent efforts to 
address emerging needs for language resources.  
Interlinear Texts and Linguistic Exploration  
Interlinear text is a product of linguistic 
fieldwork often in low-density languages. The 
physical appearance of interlinear text typically 
consists of a main text line annotated with 
linguistic transcriptions and analyses, such as 
morphological representations, glosses at 
various levels, part-of-speech tags, and a free 
translation at the sentence level. Fragments of 
these annotation lines are vertically aligned with 
the corresponding fragments of text. Phrasal 
translations and footnotes are often presented on 
other lines. Interlinear texts come in many forms 
and can be represented digitally in many ways, 
e.g. plain text with hard spacing, tables, special 
markup, and special-purpose data structures. 
There are various methods for linking to audio 
data and lexical entries, and for including 
footnotes and other marginalia. This diversity of 
form presents problems for general-purpose 
software for searching, exchanging, displaying 
and enriching interlinear texts. Nonetheless 
interlinear text is a precious resource with 
multiple uses in natural language processing. Its 
various components can be used in the 
development of lexical and morphological 
resources, can support tagging and parsing and 
can provide training material for machine 
translation. Maeda and Bird (2000, 2001) 
demonstrated a tool for creating interlinear text. 
A screenshot appears in Figure 1.

Toolkit 
Sociolinguistic Annotation  
The quantitative analysis of linguistic 
variation begins with empirical observation and 
statistical description of linguistic behavior. 
Although general computer technology 
encourages the collection, annotation, analysis 
and discussion of linguistic behavior wholly 
within the digital domain, few tools exist to help 
the sociolinguist in this effort. The project on 
Data and Annotations for Sociolinguistics 
(DASL) is investigating best practices via a case 
study of well-documented sociolinguistic 
phenomena in several large speech corpora: 
TIMIT , Switchboard-1, CallHome and Hub-4. 
Researchers are currently annotating the corpora 
for t/d deletion, the process by which [t] and [d] 
sometimes fail to be realized under certain 
phonological, morphological and social 
conditions. The case study is also a means to 
address broader questions: How do the specified 
corpora compare with the interview data 
typically used in sociolinguistics? Will the study 
of corpus data reveal new patterns not evident in 
the more common studies conducted within the 
framework of the speech community? Can 
empirical research on language variation be 
organized on a large scale with teams of non-
specialist annotators? 
All of the data used in DASL were originally 
created to support human language technology 
development; the datasets are currently being 
reannotated to support empirical studies of 
linguistic variation. A custom annotation tool 
allows users to query each corpus for tokens of 
potential interest greatly reducing effort relative 
to traditional approaches. Annotators can read or 
listen to each token, access demographic data 
and encode their observations in formats 
compatible with other analytical software used 
in the community. The web-based interface in 
Figure 2 promotes multi-site annotation and the 
study of inter-annotator consistency (Cieri and 
Strassel, 2001). 
Authoring Resources and Tools for Language 
Learning 
Although current information technology 
encourages new approaches in computer assisted 
language learning and teaching, progress in this 
area is hampered by an inadequate supply of 
language resources. The SMART (Source Media 
Authoring Resources and Tools) pilot project is 
addressing this problem by providing 
appropriately licensed data and software 
resources for preparing language-learning 
material. The Linguistic Data Consortium, a 
partner in this effort, is contributing several of 
its large data sets including conversational and 
broadcast data in Arabic, English, French and 
German. The language resources overlap almost 
completely with those used in language 
engineering. SMART is building upon the 
distribution model established in LDC Online, a 
service that provides network-based access to 
hundreds of gigabytes of text and audio data and 
annotations. Audio data are available digitally in 
files corresponding to a conversation, broadcast 
or other linguistic event. To facilitate searching, 
LDC Online includes, according to their 
availability, human- and machine-generated 
Figure 2: Sociolinguistic Annotation Tool 
transcripts time-aligned to permit more fine-
grained access. For example, where a time-
aligned transcript of a conversation exists, users 
may extract, reformat and play any segment 
specified by the time stamps in the transcript. 
SMART is building upon this foundation by 
providing additional data resources, browsing 
and search customized to the needs of language 
teachers and additional output formats to 
accommodate courseware authoring tools 
available in the commercial market. 
SMART promises to benefit a wide range of 
language teachers and learners but only to the 
extent that its resources are readily available. 
The volume of SMART data exceeds that which 
can be easily transferred over a network. Even 
small video clips consume hundreds of megabits 
of bandwidth. Instead SMART data will be 
delivered via servers that maintain raw data and 
associated annotations, permit browsing and 
queries and allow the user to specify the format 
and granularity of the response. The user will 
have the option of downloading the data for 
local use or adding annotations that may be kept 
privately or made public via the annotation 
server. The technology of the annotation server 
coupled with the extensibility of annotation 
graphs described below will enables nearly 
unconstrained access to SMART data. 
These efforts to support interlinear text, 
sociolinguistic annotation and multimodal data 
in language teaching each require flexible access 
to signal data and associated annotations. The 
sections that follow describe an architecture that 
provides such access. 
4 Annotation Graphs, Annotation 
Servers and a Query Language: 
Common Infrastructure for 
Coordinated Research, Resource 
Development 
Storing and serving large amounts of 
annotated data via the web requires 
interoperable data representations and tools 
along with methods for handling external 
formats and protocols for querying and 
delivering annotations. Annotation graphs were 
presented by Bird and Liberman (1999) as a 
general purpose model for representing and 
manipulating annotations of time series data, 
regardless of their physical storage format.  An 
annotation graph is a labeled, directed, acyclic 
graph with time offsets on some of its nodes. 
The formalism is illustrated below by 
application to the TIMIT Corpus (Garofolo et al 
1986). The original TIMIT word file contains 
starting and ending offsets (in 16KHz samples) 
and transcripts of each word in the audio file  
 
train/dr1/fjsp0/sa1.wrd: 
 2360    5200   she 
 5200    9680   had  
 9680   11077   your 
11077   16626   dark 
16626   22179   suit 
22179   24400   in 
24400   30161   greasy 
30161   36150   wash 
36720   41839   water 
41839   44680   all 
44680   49066   year  
 
The phone file provides the same information 
for each sound in the audio file. This is the 
phonetic transcription for ?she had?.  
 
train/dr1/fjsp0/sa1.phn: 
    0    2360    h# 
 2360    3720    sh 
 3720    5200    iy 
 5200    6160    hv 
 6160    8720    ae 
 8720    9680    dcl 
 9680   10173    y 
10173   11077    axr 
11077   12019    dcl 
12019   12257    d 
 
A section of the corresponding annotation 
graph appears in Figure 3. Each node displays 
the node identifier and the time offset.  The arcs 
are decorated with type and label information. 
Type W is for words and the type P is for 
phonetic transcriptions. 
Figure 3: A TIMIT annotation graph 
Since an annotation graph is just a set of 
(timed) nodes, arcs and labels, it can be trivially 
represented using three relational tables: 
 
Time:       Arc:               Label: 
 N     T      A   X   Y  T      A  L 
--------     -------------     ------- 
 0     0      1   0   1  P      1  h# 
 1  2360      2   1   2  P      2  sh 
 2  3270      3   2   3  P      3  iy 
 3  5200      4   3   4  P      4  hv 
 4  6160      5   4   5  P      5  ae 
 5  8720      6   5   6  P      6  dcl 
 6  9680      7   6   7  P      7  y 
 7 10173      8   7   8  P      8  axr 
 8 11077      9   8   9  P      9  dcl 
 9 12019     10   9  10  P     10  d 
 
10 12257     19   3   6  W     18  she 
14 16626     20   6   8  W     19  had 
17 22179     21   8  14  W     20  your 
             22  14  17  W     21  dark  
                               22  suit 
 
A large amount of annotation can be 
efficiently represented and indexed in this 
manner.  This brings us to the question of 
converting (or loading) existing data into such a 
database. The LDC's catalog alone includes 
nearly 200 publications, where each typically 
has its own format (often more than one). The 
sheer quantity and diversity of the data presents 
a significant challenge to the conversion 
process.  In addition, some corpora exist in 
multiple versions, or include uncorrected, 
corrected and re-corrected parts. 
The Annotation Graph Toolkit, version 1.0, 
contains a complete implementation of the 
annotation graph model, import filters for 
several formats, loading/storing data to an 
annotation server (MySQL), application 
programming interfaces in C++ and Tcl/tk, and 
example annotation tools for dialogue, ethology 
and interlinear text.  The supported formats are: 
xlabel, TIMIT, BAS Partitur, Penn Treebank, 
Switchboard, LDC Callhome, CSV and AIF 
level 0.  Future work will provide Python and 
Perl interfaces, more supported formats, a query 
language and interpreter, and a multi-channel 
transcription tool.  All software is distributed 
under an open source license, and is available 
from http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/AG/. 
Given that the annotation data can be stored 
in a relational database, it can be queried 
directly in SQL.  More convenient, a domain-
specific query language will be developed (see 
Cassidy and Bird 2000 and the work cited 
there). Query expressions will be transmitted 
over the web in the form of a CGI request, and 
translated into SQL by the annotation server. 
The resulting annotation data will be returned in 
the form of an XML document.  An example for 
the TIMIT database, using the language 
proposed by Cassidy and Bird (2000), will serve 
to illustrate: 
Find word arcs spanning a sequence of 
segments beginning with hv and containing ae: 
http://BASE-URL/cgi-bin/query? 
X.[].Y<timit/word; 
X.[:hv].[]*.[:ae].[]*.Y<-timit/ph 
Executed on the above annotation data, this 
query would return the XML document in 
Figure 4. 
Neither the query nor the returned document 
are intended for human consumption. A client-
side annotation tool will initiate queries and 
display annotation content on behalf of an end-
user.

This annotation tool and server are integrated 
using the model shown below. A simplified 
client-server model, working at the level of 
annotation files is already available with the 
current distribution of the Annotation Graph 
Toolkit. Significantly, a networked annotation 
tool is identical to a standalone version, except 
that the AG library fetches its data from a 
remote server instead of local disk.  
 
The annotation graph formalism, annotation 
servers and the emerging query language will 
provide basic infrastructure to store, process and 
deliver essentially arbitrary amounts and types 
of signal annotations for a wide variety of 
research and teaching tasks including those 
described above. This infrastructure will enable 
reuse of existing resources and coordinated 
development of new resources both within and 
across research communities working with 
annotated linguistic datasets. 
5 Remaining Challenges to Language 
Resource Development 
We have described a process whereby 
annotated data in a variety of formats can be 
loaded into a central database server that 
interacts directly with annotation tools. The 
Annotation Graph Toolkit, version 1.0, is the 
first implementation of this architecture. As the 
toolkit undergoes future development, it will 
need to deal continually with conversion issues. 
Annotation data will continue to be created and 
manipulated by multiple tools and to be stored 
in incompatible file formats.  Data will continue 
to be mapped between different formats so that 
appropriate tools can be used, and appropriately 
managed to keep inconsistencies from arising.  
There will still be times when we need to trace 
the provenance of a particular item, back 
through a history involving several formats. 
These will always be hard problems; the 
proposed infrastructure will address them but no 
infrastructure is likely to eliminate conversion, 
integrity and provenance issues. 
Annotation graphs focus on the problems of 
dealing with time series. They do not directly 
address paradigmatic data such as lexicons and 
demographic tables. One should note however, 
that time series data and paradigmatic data can 
be united efficiently. As already mentioned, 
annotation graphs may be stored trivially in 
relational tables, technology routinely  used for 
paradigmatic data. In this way, conventional 
?joins? of relational table can convolve time-
series annotations with paradigms (e.g. texts 
with dictionaries or utterances with speaker 
demographics). 
Through judicious compromises - such as 
one-time computer-assisted conversion of 
legacy annotation data and creating once-off 
interfaces to existing useful tools - and through 
the judicious combination of simple and well-
supported formalisms and technologies as 
described above, we believe that the 
management problems can be substantially 
reduced in scale and severity. 
We can illustrate the advantages of AG with 
a example of the annotation of the Switchboard 
corpus for ?t/d deletion. Switchboard contains 
two-channel audio of thousands of 5-minute 
conversations among pairs of speakers that have 
been transcribed with the transcripts time-
aligned to the audio. A single utterance is 
written: 
 
274.35 279.50 A.119 Uh, he, 
uh, carves out different figures 
in the, in the plants, 
 
giving the start and stop time of the utterance, 
channel, speaker ID and the transcript of the 
utterance. This can be converted trivially into 
AG format as above. 
Figure 5:  Interactions among annotation tools 
and the annotation server 
The DASL tool concordances audio 
transcripts and identifies utterances in which the 
target phenomenon (eg. ?t/d deletion) may 
occur. A line of the concordance file contains 
two IDs one to identify the utterance within the 
concordance, the other to link back to the 
original corpus. The <annotate> tags identify a 
potential environment for the phenomenon 
under study.  
 
<sample id="1" senid="10194">uh 
he uh carves out <annotate> 
different figures </annotate> in 
the in the p[lants]- plants 
shrubs </sample> 
 
The link between the concordance and the 
original corpus is maintained through a table 
containing: Sentence_ID, File_ID, Start_Time, 
Stop_Time, Channel and Speaker. 
 
10194 2141 274.35  279.50 A 1139 
 
Speakers? demographic data appears in 
another table containing: Speaker_ID, Sex, Age, 
Region, Education_Level 
 
1139, MALE, 50, NORTHERN, 2 
 
The DASL interface embeds the concordance 
results in a template containing input fields for 
each parameter to be annotated (see Figure 2). 
The linguist?s annotation of the utterance can be 
stored in AG formalism as in Figure 5. Note that 
although AGs provide an elegant and general 
solution to the annotation of time series data, 
they do not remove the need to deal with the ad 
hoc formats one may encounter in various 
corpora. Nor do they remove the need to track 
the relations among elements in time-series data 
and paradigmatic material. 
6 Conclusions  
Researchers in human language share 
assumptions and needs within and across 
research communities. Each group feels an acute 
need for language resources including data, 
annotations, formats and processes. This paper 
has summarized some common needs and 
described an architecture for encoding 
annotations and delivering them via annotation 
servers using SQL or a custom query language. 
Much of the architecture discussed has already 
been created and is available in the Annotation 
Graphic Toolkit. Other components, especially 
the query language, are currently under 
development. It is hoped that tools based on 
annotations graphs and annotation servers will 
encourage greater levels of resource sharing and 
the coordination of future resource development.
