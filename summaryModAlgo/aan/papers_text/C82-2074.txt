In  the  course of  d i scern ib le  h i s to ry  i t  i s  not too 
d i f f i cu l t  to  t race  a number o f  events  when some d iscover ies  
or  invent ions  - techn ica l  by the i r  nature  - had an overa l l  
and profound impact upon the human soc ie ty  in  .genera l .  Pro-  
bab ly ,  the most v iv id  example o f  such events  i s  the  invent ion  
o f  wr i t ing .  An event  equal  in  scope and s ign i f i cance  has to  
be conf ronted  by us today.  I t  i s  the making of  the  computer.  
Apprehension ot on ly  of  the techn ica l ,  but a l so  of  the 
social significance of its appearance was first expressed in 
1950 when the classical work of Alan Turing Computing Machin- 
ery and Intelli~enoe came out. However, it is only at the 
present moment that we have come close to being able to 
apprec ia te  th i s  event adequate ly  and to  ac tua l ly  rea l i ze  the  
perspect ives  i t  has opened. Now we have a l l  the  grounds to 
s ta te  that  w i th  the  ar r iva l  of  the computer and wi th  l c reat -  
ing  the programs which ensure i t s  funct ion ing ,  we move from 
the  epoch o f  p~vs ioa l ly  operat ing  machines in to  the epoch o f  
machines operat ing  in te l l igent ly .  T rac ing  the ways o f  deve-  
lolxnent o f  phys ica l ly  operat ing  machines may prov ide  us w i th  
the  knowledge which w i l l  become he lp fu l  fo r  the concept ion

The a foresa id  may be regarded  as the  geners l  in t roduct -

ce, and, ix~regardlese of how general it ~ be, it bears a 
direct relation to them. 
The conference is devoted to computational linguistics 
and to a considerable extent its task is to elucidate how the 
latter is related to computational sciences as such, to mathe- 
matics, to linguistics proper, to artificial intelligence and 
so forth~ Behind these scientific disciplines lie such-  
although unmentioned, yet ever-present-entitles, categories 
and phenomena s in te l l igence ,  thou~ht ,  consc iousness ,  memo- 
r~ comprehension,  knowledge and many o thers  which are in -  
d i spensab le  fo r  so lv ing  the problems to be d i scussed .  
Let us beg in  w i th  ra i s ing  the quest ion  of  what i s  com- 
putat iona l  l i ngu is t i cs ,  whether i t  has a c lear ly  out l ined  
f ie ld  of  research ,  and why i t  i s  necessary  to es tab l i sh  i t s  
re la t ion  to  the d i sc ip l ines  named in  the program. I t  could 
balmily be c la imed that  computat iona l  l lD~Lst i ce  i s  none the 
o ther  than l ingu is t i cs  employing means of  computat ion (hard -  
ware and so f tware)  fo r  so lv ing  s t r i c t ly  l ingu is t i c  tasks .  The 
same re fers  to  computat iona l  semant ics ,  computat ional  spntax 
(pars ing) ,  and Compu~ations~ phonet ics  (automat ic  recogn i t ion  
o f  acoust i c  images) .  Taken as a whole as we l l  as in  i t s  sub- 
d iv i s ions ,  computat iona l  l i ngu is t i cs  i s  on ly  a component in  
the  complex domain o f  invest igat ions  which u l t imate ly  serves  
the purpose of  bu i ld ing  var ious  types of  in te l l igent ly  operat -  
ing  machines.  Taken as such i t  does not v i r tua l ly  ex i s t  o r ,  
at  a~ ra te ,  does not  requ i re  to be s ing led  out as an auto -  
nomous d i sc ip l ine .  In  po int  of  fac t ,  i t  i s  conce ived only  in  
the context  of  o ther  sc ient i f i c  d i sc ip l ines  brought together

that  we deal  here ,  as has a l ready  been sa id ,  w i th  a complex 
sc ient i f i c  fo rmat ion  or ,  in  o ther  words, wi th a domain of  
in terd i sc ip l inary  s tud ies .  This in terd i sc ip l inary  domain has 
been repeated ly  re fe r red  to  as the cogn i t ive  sc ience .  For the 
sake of  conven ience ,  th i s  descr ip t ive  term should be pre fer -  
ab ly  rep laced  by a more compact one, vi_~z. ?cog i to lo~ ? . The 
compos i t ion  of  cog i to logy  var ies  w i th  var ious  authors  but as 
i t s  ind ispensab le  components are  mentioned l in@lz i s t i cs ,  psy-  
cho logy,  theory  of  knowledge (ep is temology) ,  and computer 
sc iences .  With in  the  framework o f  cog i to logy  a l l  these  d i s -  
c ip l ines  do not enter  in to  sc ient i f i c  cc l loborat ion  in  o rder

examining the  same ob jec t  in  d i f fe rent  aspects .  Complex 
sc ient i f i c  fo rmat ions  are Jus t i f i ed  on ly  i f  they  prov ide the  
invest igator  w i th  new too ls  of  cogn i t ion  which cannot be pro -  
v ided  by any o f  the oo l loborat ing  d i sc ip l ines  taken separate ly .  
Such fo rmat ions  make severe  demands in  accordance wi th  which 
de f in i t ions  o f  the i r  ca tegor ies  should be equa l ly  acceptab le  
fo r  a l l  cc l leboret ing  d i sc ip l ines  or  - what i s  the  ease -

Th~s computat iona l  l i ngu is t i cs  i s  l i ngu is t i cs  in  that  
form which i t  acqu i res  in  cog i to logy ,  be ing i t s  fundamental

The bas ic  and mutua l ly  determined categor ies  of  cog i to -  
lo~ are  in te l l igence ,  knowledge, langu~e.  None of  these  
categor ies  has a prec i se  and ind isputab le  de f in i t ion .  In  th i s  
s i tuat ion  one has to  proceed from some working de f in i t ions  
whose su i tab leness  i s  ver i f ied  by subsequent p ract i ca l  research .  
I t  see~ acceptab le  in  these  c i rcumstances  to de f ine  in te l l i -

genoe as an inherent  in  l tv iug  organisms mechanism of generat -  
ing  knowledge and i t s  purposefu l  rea l i za t ion  in  the in teract -  
ion  of an organism with the environment of i t s  funct ion ing .  
Here by environment i s  meant the sum to ta l  of pb,Tsical ,  
soc ia l ,  and sp i r i tua l  fac tors  which an organism meets wi th  in  
the process of i t s  v i ta l  ac t iv i ty .  
Owi~ to  i t s  d ivers i ty ,  to provide a more or  less  un-  
equivoca l  de f in i t ion  of knowledge i s  more d i f f i cu l t ,  a .  a 
mat ter  of fac t ,  the pr imary goal  of oo~to lo~ as the theoret -  
i ca l  foandat ton  fo r  fu l f i l l i ng  the task  posed above i s  the 
descr ip t ion  of the nature ,  shape, and scope of human knowled- 
ge. At th i s  s take of cominK i n to  being, co~to lo~ .has to 
deal  on ly  with those k inds  of knowledge which possess the 
qua l i t ies  of ob jec t iveness ,  which are endorsed by memory, and 
which are d i sc re te  in  form. 
A l l  these character i s t i cs  are acqu i red  by knowledge 
through the ins t rumenta l i ty  of language.  To them i t  a l so  adds 
in terpretat ion  of knowledge s ince  in  the endors ing  i t  by memo- 
ry  as wel l  as in  the process of makinK i t  d i sc re te  one has to  
deal  wi th  choice and s ince  the knowledge the machine operates  
wi th  has to be app l ied  to concrete  rea l  world s i tuat ions  
which can be in terpreted  in  a d i f fe rent  way? 
When we speak about bu i ld ing  in te l l igent ly  operat ing  
machines,  two 4,nportant fac tors  should be taken in to  account .  
Hachines of th i s  k ind can-or  imi ta te  man's  in te l lec tua l  ac t iv -  
i t i es  in  the i r  ent i re ty  but are employed to  perform separate  
aspects ,  parameters ,  or  "Jobs" of human in te l lec t  ( in te l l tgen-  
ce) :  Due to th i s  separateness  the mechanism of the i r  funct ion -  
ink  should inswl tab ly  d i f fe r  from the way th i s  work i s  per -  
formed i~  the inner  tn terconnect ions  and in  the context  of the  
to ta l  complex struo~turo f human in te l l igence?  ~n Ident i f i ca t -  
i on  can.be drawn here only  with respect  to f ina l  "products ' ?  
And, as the h i s to ry  of oreat tnK phys ica l ly  operat inK machines 
teaches us, in te l l~gent ly  operat ing machines are not bu i l t  to 
merely imi ta te  some ?.lobs" of human in te l l igence ,  but in  order  "
