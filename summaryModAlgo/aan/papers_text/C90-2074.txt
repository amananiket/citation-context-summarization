':\[his paper describes a rule-based machine learn- 
ing approach to morphological processing in the 
system called XMAS. XMAS discovers and ac- 
quires linguistic rules from examples of morpho- 
logical combinations and accomplishes the mor- 
phological analysis and synthesis by applying 
the rules. This approach is independent of lan- 
guages, saves time and effort for development 
and maintenance, and takes small lexicon space. 
A Korean version of XMAS is effectively work- 
ing in the English-Korean machine translation 
system KSHALT. 
1 In t roduct ion  
From the knowledge ngineering perspective in 
artificial intelligence, a natural language process- 
Jng (NLP) system can be seen as a knowledge- 
based system in which major concerns are the 
discovery, acqlfisition and maintenance of knowl- 
edge or rules \[2\]. 
The main purpose of this paper is to present 
a method for facilitating the development and 
maintenance of NLP systems by automating the 
discovery and acquisition of linguistic rules in 
the domain of morphology. This method was 
implemented in a morphological processor called 
XMAS as a part of the English-Korean machine 
translation project KSHALT \[4\]. 
In Section 2, we give an overview of the XMAS 
system. Section 3 illustrates the representational 
formalism. In Section 4, the processes of discov- 
ery and acquisition of morphological rules are 
described. In Section 5, the procedures for mor- 
phologicM analysis and synthesis are briefly de- 
scribed and the application results are reported. 
Section 6 concludes this paper by comparing 
XMAS with other related works and by remark- 
ing on further work. 
2 An  Overv iew o f  XMAS 
XMAS (Xpert in Morphological Analysis and 
Synthesis) is a learning system \[12,13,14\] which 
consists of a learning element (Meta-XMAS), a 
knowledge base (KB), and two inference ngines 
of a morphological nalyzer (MOA) and a mor- 
phological synthesizer (MOS). Figure 1 shows an 
overview of XMAS and its operational environ- 
ment (parser and generator of natural anguage 
systems).

The knowledge base contains a lexicon and 
a rule base. The lexicon has entries only for 
word stems. The rule base contains the mor- 
phological rules which are learned from training 
examples. TEACHER, a human trainer, traces 
the execution of XMAS and provides training 
examples and critiques for Meta-XMAS. Meta- 
XMAS, a machine learner, acquires linguistic 
knowledge by discovering, formulating, general- 
izing and specializing rammatical rules. MOA 
solves the morphological analysis problems by 
applying the rules. MOS accomplishes the mor- 
phological synthesis by applying the rules. 
3 Description Languages 
3.1 Example  Descr ip t ion  Language 
The rule discovery procedure is initiated by 
training examples. Two kinds of training ex- 
amples are used: generalization examples and 
specialization examples. The generalization ex- 
amples are used to maintain the completeness 
of the rule base and the specializaition examples 
are used to maintain the consistency of the rule 
base \[3\]. A training example consists of a class 
name, two strings of before and after, and a cri- 
t ique-an optional tag, indicating if the example 
is a specialization example. An instance of a gen- 
eralization example is (PLURAL "baby" "ba- 
bies"). 
3.2 Rule  Descr ip t ion  Language 
The formalism for the representation f morpho- 
logical rules is the string productions which are 
similar to if-then production rules \[14\]. A string 
production is a self-contained operator which 
consists of a left-hand side (LHS) and a right- 
hand side (RHS). It is symmetric and therefore 
applicable bidirectionally. 
<strlng-production> : := ( <LHS> ------* < I~HS> ) 
<LHS> : := ( (  <feature>*  ) <pat tern>)  
< I tHS> : := ( <pattern> ( <feature>* ) ) 
<feature> ::= <category:> \]<conjugation:> \[
<prononciation> \[<accent> \[ . . .  
<pattern> : := ( < lw indow> <main> <rwiadow>)  
<category> : := NOUN \] VERB \[ ADJ  \[ ADV I " ' "  
The string production can accomodate not 
only graphemic patterns but also syntactic and 
phonological features \[1\]. A string production 
can have name(s) which is useful for direct ac- 
cess and maintenance of the rules. 
For example, the following rule is a string pro- 
duction 
(((NOUN SG) ((b) (y) (%))) --~ 
(((=) (i c s) (%))(NOUN BL))) 
where =y/ies% can be assigned to the name of 
the rule whose class name is PLURAL.

Morphological Rules

The procedure LEARNING (Figure 2) describes 
the top-level algorithm for rule learning in Meta- 
XMAS.

end LE AI'tNIN G 
Figure 2: The learning procedure of 
Meta-XMAS 
Given a training example, Meta-XMAS searches 
the lexicon for the features of the word stem 
before. By comparing the before with after, 
a micro-operator (mop) and its name is con- 
structed (DISCOVER). The mop is a descrip- 
tion of the transformation procedure from be- 
fore to after. From these, a hypothetical rule 
H is generated (FORMULATE). Then it checks 
if other rules with the same name already exist 
(MATCH). If yes, then the most special rule R 
is selected (RESOLVE) and H and R are gen- 
eralized or specialized according to the critique 
(GENERALIZE or SPECIALIZE). If no, then 
the rule H is appended to the present rule base 
with the new rule name (CREATE). 
4.2 D iscovery  o f  Ru les  
The rule discovery procedure works as follows. 
First, the input strings before and after of the 
training example are compared and splitted by 
using the four pointers--/b, rb, la and ra. The 
pointers Ib and la move one grapheme at a time 
from the left end to the right, while the pointers 
rb and ra move from the right end to the left, 
until lb and la (rb and ra, respectively) point 
different graphemes. 
432 2 
This results in dividing each string into the 
three regions (lwindow, main and rwindow) 
which represent he left context, main string, 
and the right context, respectively. The cor- 
responding contexts of both strings are gener- 
alized to '='  symbol which means remains un- 
changed. The result is a micro-operator (mop). 
And then, a rule name is given to the mop by 
creating a symbol representing the transforma- 
tion form. For the training example 
(PLURAL "baby" "babies") 
the mop is 
((b) (y) (%)) --+ ((=) (i e s) (%)) 
whose name is =y/ies%. 
Finally, a hypothetical rule for the given train- 
ing ex0anple is generated by integrating the class 
name, the rule name, the features, and the mop. 
In our example, the following rule is generated 
(in a simplified form): 
=y/ies%: (PLURAL (NOUN) ((b) (y) (%)) -~  
((=) (i e s) (%))) 
4.:~ Acquis i t ion of  Rules 
The acquisition process of rules is the iteration of 
the creation of new rules and the modification of 
existing rules. Modification is carried out by gen- 
eralization on the one hand and specialization on 
the other hand. Meta-XMAS uses the four kinds 
of induction rules in generalization \[10\]: 
1. Variablization of constant: replace a 
grapheme by =. 
2. Dropping AND conditions: decrement the 
contextual window size. 
3. Adding OR conditions: 1talon the two 
grapheme sets. 
4. Climbing generalization trees: climb the 
path to the root of the tree. 
A concept is represented asa set of graphemes 
or features which can have an explicit name. The 
generalization tree \[11\] is a tree which describes 
the generalization relations between the concepts 
in the domain. Figure 3 shows a generalization 
tree for Korean graphemes.

PVowel NVowel * Consonant 
~ \ ] -  r ~ _  I 
~ a T z .  a . z ~ z ~ s ~ x  
Figure 3: A generalization tree for Korean 
graphemes 
Generalization using the tree is a process of 
following the path to the root on the basis of 
training examples. This is useful in concept 
learning in a well-established domain. In gen- 
eral, however, the generalization tree is not given 
a priori. In this case the Meta-XMAS builds the 
trees for itself (see Appendix A). The two gener- 
alization strategies have their strengths and \]im- 
itations. The first strategy needs more a priori 
linguistic knowledge, but it is better in learn- 
ing efficiency. The second strategy guarantees to
find detailed rules, but is less efficient in learning 
speed. 
If Meta-XMAS applies only the generaliza- 
tion schemes, the rules learned can be over- 
generalized. So at any point (e.g. in case of 
false output) the rules should be specialized to 
avoid the overgeneralization or to handle the ex- 
ceptions. Meta-XMAS accomplishes this auto- 
matically with the aid of specialization exam- 
ples. The specialization process is a kind of 
rule creation procedure in which overgeneraliza- 
tion is checked and the overly generalized rule 
is recovered--by going down the generalization 
tree to the leaves or eliminating a grapheme from 
a concept, if necessary. 
5 Morpho log ica l  Ana lys i s  and  
Synthes is  
XMAS has two inference engines (or rule- 
interpreters) of MOA and MOS. MOA, the 
morphological analyzer, solves the morpholog- 
ical analysis problms by applying the rules in 
the RHS-driven forward chaining manner \[14\]. 
MOS, the morphological synthesizer, solves the 
morphologicM synthesis problems by applying 
? the rules in the LHS-driven forward chaining 
3 433 
manner  (see Appendix B). More than one mor- 
phemes can be synthesized and analyzed by an 
instruction. If more than one rule is applicable in 
rule selection, then MOA/MOS selects the most 
special rule. So the rules in the rule base need 
not be ordered, making the maintenance of the 
rule base very easy. 
XMAS is implemented on a SUN workstation 
in a Common-LISP program. A variety of exper- 
iments were carried out with XMAS on deriva~ 
tional and inflectional phenomena in almost all of 
the Korean language and part of the English and 
the German languages \[17\]. The results were suc- 
cessful in the sense that Meta-XMAS learns the 
gralnmatical rules and MOA/MOS solves cor- 
rectly the morphological nalysis and synthesis 
problems by applying the rules. Part of the rules 
learned by XMAS are shown in Appendix C. A 
more efficient Korean version of XMAS, called 
MASK \[19\], was applied to the generation of 
Korean language in the English-Korean machine 
translation system KSHALT \[4\] and MASK is 
effectively working now. 
improved by the capabilities (1), (2), (4)and (6). 
The advantage (8) comes especially from (6) and 
(7). The property (9)is an indirect demonstra- 
tion of XMAS approach as a practical approach. 
As for all rule-based systems, XMAS is less 
efficient in run time in comparison with proce- 
dural systems \[6\]. There is a way to improve 
the run-time fficiency. One can construct a rule 
compiler as the transducer in KIMMO systems 
\[5,7\]. 
But XMAS is better in effectiveness in devel- 
opment and maintenance. In addition to the 
run-time efficiency, these factors should also be 
considered because, as was mentioned at the be- 
ginning, a natltral language processing system 
is a complex knowledge-based system which reo 
quires a long period of design, implementation, 
test, debugging, and extention time. 
In addition to being a practical knowledge ac- 
quisition tool, Meta-XMAS in isolation can also 
be used as a linguists' tool for scientific discovery 
\[8\] which aids linguists in the discovery and test 
of grammatical rules in morphology. 
6 Related Work and Conclud- 
ing Remarks 
In stunmary, XMAS, including Meta-XMAS as 
a linguistic knowledge acquisition tool, is char- 
acterized by the following capabilities and prop- 
erties: 
1. using graphemic, phonological, and syntac- 
tic information 
2. analysis as well as synthesis 
3. :language independent 
4. capable of treating infix inflections as well 
as prefix and suffix 
5. simple and small lexicon 
6. rules need not be orderd 
7. automatic discovery and acquisition of lin- 
guistic knowledge by inductive machine 
learning 
8. easily maintainable 
9. working in a machine translation system. 
The properties (2), (3), and (4) are the same 
as in Kaplan et al \[5\], but XMAS has in ad- 
dition the properties (5)-(9). XMAS shares the 
properties (3) and (7) with Wothke \[15\], but is
