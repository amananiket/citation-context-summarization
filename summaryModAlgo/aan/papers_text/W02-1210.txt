Abstract  
We present a broad coverage Japanese 
grammar written in the HPSG formalism 
with MRS semantics. The grammar is 
created for use in real world applications, 
such that robustness and performance issues 
play an important role. It is connected to a 
POS tagging and word segmentation tool. 
This grammar is being developed in a 
multilingual context, requiring MRS 
structures that are easily comparable across 
languages. 
Introduction 
Natural language processing technology has 
recently reached a point where applications that 
rely on deep linguistic processing are becoming 
feasible.  Such applications (e.g. message 
extraction systems, machine translation and 
dialogue understanding systems) require natural 
language understanding, or at least an 
approximation thereof.  This, in turn, requires 
rich and highly precise information as the output 
of a parse.  However, if the technology is to 
meet the demands of real-world applications, 
this must not come at the cost of robustness.  
Robustness requires not only wide coverage by 
the grammar (in both syntax and semantics), but 
also large and extensible lexica as well as 
interfaces to preprocessing systems for named 
entity recognition, non-linguistic structures such 
as addresses, etc.  Furthermore, applications 
built on deep NLP technology should be 
extensible to multiple languages.  This requires 
flexible yet well-defined output structures that 
can be adapted to grammars of many different 
languages.  Finally, for use in real-world 
applications, NLP systems meeting the above 
desiderata must also be efficient. 
In this paper, we describe the development of 
a broad coverage grammar for Japanese that is 
used in an automatic email response application. 
The grammar is based on work done in the 
Verbmobil project (Siegel 2000) on machine 
translation of spoken dialogues in the domain of 
travel planning. It has since been greatly 
extended to accommodate written Japanese and 
new domains. 
The grammar is couched in the theoretical 
framework of Head-Driven Phrase Structure 
Grammar (HPSG) (Pollard & Sag 1994), with 
semantic representations in Minimal Recursion 
Semantics (MRS) (Copestake et al 2001).  
HPSG is well suited to the task of multilingual 
development of broad coverage grammars: It is 
flexible enough (analyses can be shared across 
languages but also tailored as necessary), and 
has a rich theoretical literature from which to 
draw analyzes and inspiration.  The 
characteristic type hierarchy of HPSG also 
facilitates the development of grammars that are 
easy to extend.  MRS is a flat semantic 
formalism that works well with typed feature 
structures and is flexible in that it provides 
structures that are under-specified for scopal 
information. These structures give compact 
representations of ambiguities that are often 
irrelevant to the task at hand.    
HPSG and MRS have the further advantage 
that there are practical and useful open-source 
tools for writing, testing, and efficiently 
processing grammars written in these 
formalisms. The tools we are using in this 
project include the LKB system (Copestake 
2002) for grammar development, [incr tsdb()] 
(Oepen & Carroll 2000) for testing the grammar 
and tracking changes, and PET (Callmeier 
2000), a very efficient HPSG parser, for 
processing.  We also use the ChaSen tokenizer 
and POS tagger (Asahara & Matsumoto 2000).  
While couched within the same general 
framework (HPSG), our approach differs from 
that of Kanayama et al(2000).  The work 
described there achieves impressive coverage 
(83.7% on the EDR corpus of newspaper text) 
with an underspecified grammar consisting of a 
small number of lexical entries, lexical types 
associated with parts of speech, and six 
underspecified grammar rules.  In contrast, our 
grammar is much larger in terms of the number 
of lexical entries, the number of grammar rules, 
and the constraints on both,1 and takes 
correspondingly more effort to bring up to that 
level of coverage.  The higher level of detail 
allows us to output precise semantic 
representations as well as to use syntactic, 
semantic and lexical information to reduce 
ambiguity and rank parses. 
1 Japanese HPSG Syntax 
The fundamental notion of an HPSG is the sign. 
A sign is a complex feature structure 
representing information of different linguistic 
levels of a phrase or lexical item. The attribute-
value matrix of a sign in the Japanese HPSG is 
quite similar to a sign in the LinGO English 
Resource Grammar (henceforth ERG) 
(Flickinger 2000), with information about the 
orthographical realization of the lexical sign in 
PHON, syntactic and semantic information in 
SYNSEM, information about the lexical status in 
LEX, nonlocal information in NONLOC, head 
information that goes up the tree in HEAD and 
information about subcategorization in SUBCAT.  
The grammar implementation is based on a 
system of types. There are 900 lexical types that 
define the syntactic, semantic and pragmatic 
properties of the Japanese words, and 188 types 
that define the properties of phrases and lexical 
rules. The grammar includes 50 lexical rules for 
inflectional and derivational morphology and 47 
phrase structure rules. The lexicon contains 5100 
stem entries. As the grammar is developed for 
use in applications, it treats a wide range of 
                                                     
1 We do also make use of generic lexical entries for 
certain parts of speech as a means of extending our 
lexicon.  See section 3 below. 
basic constructions of Japanese.  Only some of 
these phenomena can be described here. 
1.1 Subcategorization 
The structure of SUBCAT is different from the 
ERG SUBCAT structure. This is due to 
differences in subcategorization between 
Japanese and English. A fundamental difference 
is the fact that, in Japanese, verbal arguments are 
frequently omitted. For example, arguments that 
refer to the speaker, addressee, and other 
arguments that can be inferred from context are 
often omitted in spoken language. Additionally, 
optional verbal arguments can scramble. On the 
other hand, some arguments are not only 
obligatory, but must also be realized adjacent to 
the selecting head. 
To account for this, our subcategorization 
contains the attributes SAT and VAL. The SAT 
value encodes whether a verbal argument is 
already saturated (such that it cannot be 
saturated again), optional or adjacent. VAL 
contains the agreement information for the 
argument. When an argument is realized, its 
SAT value on the mother node is specified as sat 
and its SYNSEM is unified with its VAL value on 
the subcategorizing head. The VAL value on the 
mother is none. Adjacency must be checked in 
every rule that combines heads and arguments or 
adjuncts. This is the principle of adjacency, 
stated as follows: 
In a headed phrase, the SUBCAT.SAT value 
on the non-head daughter must not contain 
any adjacent arguments. In a head-
complement structure, the SUBCAT.SAT 
value of the head daughter must not contain 
any adjacent arguments besides the non-
head daughter. In a head-adjunct structure, 
the SUBCAT.SAT value of the head daughter 
must not contain any adjacent arguments. 
1.2 Verbal inflection 
Japanese verb stems combine with endings that 
provide information about honorification, tense, 
aspect, voice and mode. Inflectional rules for the 
different types of stems prepare the verb stems 
for combination with the verbal endings. For 
example, the verb stem yomu must be inflected 
to yon to combine with the past tense ending da. 
Morphological features constrain the 
combination of stem and ending. In the above 
example, the inflectional rule changes the mu 
character to the n character and assigns the value 
nd-morph to the morphological feature 
RMORPH-BIND-TYPE. The ending da selects 
for a verbal stem with this value.  
Endings can be combined with other endings, 
as in -sase-rare-mashi-ta (causative-potential-
honorific-past), but not arbitrarily: 
 *-sase-mashi-rare-ta 
 *-sase-ta-mashi-rare 
 -sase-ta 
 -rare-mashi-ta 
This is accounted for with two kinds of rules 
which realize mutually selected elements. In the 
combination of stem and ending, the verb stem 
selects for the verbal ending via the head feature 
SPEC. In the case of the combination of two 
verbal endings, the first ending selects for the 
second one via the head feature MARK. In both 
cases, the right element subcategorizes for the 
left one via SUBCAT.VAL.SPR. Using this 
mechanism, it is possible to control the sequence 
of verbal endings: Verb stems select verbal 
endings via SPEC and take no SPR, derivational 
morphemes (like causative or potential) select 
tense endings or other derivational morphemes 
via MARK and subcategorize for verb stems 
and/or verb endings via SPR (sase takes only 
verb stems), and tense endings take verb stems 
or endings as SPR and take no MARK or SPEC 
(as they occur at the end of the sequence).  
1.3 Complex Predicates 
A special treatment is needed for Japanese 
verbal noun + light verb constructions. In these 
cases, a word that combines the qualities of a 
noun with those of a verb occurs in a 
construction with a verb that has only marginal 
semantic information. The syntactic, semantic 
and pragmatic information on the complex is a 
combination of the information of the two.  
Consider example 1. The verbal noun 
benkyou contains subcategorization information 
(transitive), as well as semantic information (the 
benkyou-relation and its semantic arguments). 
The light verb shi-ta supplies tense information 
(past). Pragmatic information can be supplied by 
both parts of the construction, as in the formal 
form o-benkyou shi-mashi-ta. The rule that 
licenses this type of combination is the vn-light-
rule, a subtype of the head-marker-rule. 
Example 1: 
Benkyou shi-ta. 
study do-past 
'Someone has studied.' 
Japanese auxiliaries combine with verbs and 
provide either aspectual or perspective 
information or information about honorification. 
In a verb-auxiliary construction, the information 
about subcategorization is a combination of the 
SUBCAT information of verb and auxiliary, 
depending on the type of auxiliary. The rule 
responsible for the information combination in 
these cases is the head-specifier-rule. We have 
three basic types of auxiliaries.  The first type is 
aspect auxiliaries.  These are treated as raising 
verbs, and include such elements as iru (roughly, 
progressive) and aru (roughly, perfective), as 
can be seen in example 2.  The other two classes 
of auxiliaries provide information about 
perspective or the point of view from which a 
situation is being described.  Both classes of 
auxiliaries add a ni (dative) marked argument to 
the argument structure of the whole predicate.  
The classes differ in how they relate their 
arguments to the arguments of the verb.  One 
class (including kureru 'give'; see example 3) are 
treated as subject control verbs.  The other class 
(including morau 'receive', see example 4) 
establishes a control relation between the ni-
marked argument and the embedded subject. 
Example 2: 
Keeki wo tabe-te iru. 
cake ACC eat progressive 
'Someone is eating cake.' 
Example 3: 
Sensei wa watashi ni hon wo  
teacher TOP  I DAT book ACC  
katte kure-ta. 
buy give-past 
'The teacher bought me a book.' 
Example 4: 
Watashi  ga sensei ni hon wo 
I  NOM teacher DAT book ACC
katte morat-ta. 
buy get-past 
'The teacher bought me a book.' 
1.4 Particles in a type hierarchy 
The careful treatment of Japanese particles is 
essential, because they are the most frequently 
occurring words and have various central 
functions in the grammar. It is difficult, because 
one particle can fulfill more than one function 
and they can co-occur, but not arbitrarily. The 
Japanese grammar thus contains a type hierarchy 
of 44 types for particles. See Siegel (1999) for a 
more detailed description of relevant phenomena 
and solutions. 
1.5 Numeral Expressions 
Number names, such as sen kyuu hyaku juu 
'1910' constitute a notable exception to the 
general head-final pattern of Japanese phrases. 
We found Smith's (1999) head-medial analysis 
of English number names to be directly 
applicable to the Japanese system as well 
(Bender 2002).  This analysis was easily 
incorporated into the grammar, despite the 
oddity of head positioning, because the type 
hierarchy of HPSG is well suited to express the 
partial generalizations that permeate natural 
language. 
On the other hand, number names in 
Japanese contrast sharply with number names in 
English in that they are rarely used without a 
numeral classifier.  
Example 5:  
Juu *(hiki no) neko ga ki-ta. 
ten   CL GEN cat NOM arrive-past 
'Ten cats arrived.' 
The grammar provides for 'true' numeral 
classifiers like hon, ko, and hiki, as well as 
formatives like en 'yen' and do 'degree' which 
combine with number names just like numeral 
classifiers do, but never serve as numeral 
classifiers for other nouns.  In addition, there are 
a few non-branching rules that allow bare 
number names to surface as numeral classifier 
phrases with specific semantic constraints.  
1.6 Pragmatic information 
Spoken language and email correspondence both 
encode references to the social relation of the 
dialogue partners. Utterances can express social 
distance between addressee and speaker and 
third persons. Honorifics can even express 
respect towards inanimates. Pragmatic 
information is treated in the CONTEXT layer of 
the complex signs. Honorific information is 
given in the CONTEXT.BACKGROUND and 
linked to addressee and speaker anchors.  
The expression of empathy or in-group vs. 
out-group is quite prevalent in Japanese. One 
means of expressing empathy is the perspective 
auxiliaries discussed above. For example, two 
auxiliaries meaning roughly 'give' (ageru and 
kureru) contrast in where they place the 
empathy.  In the case of ageru, it is with the 
giver.  In the case of kureru, it is with the 
recipient. We model this within the sign by 
positing a feature EMPATHY within CONTEXT 
and linking it to the relevant arguments' indices. 
2 Japanese MRS Semantics  
In the multilingual context in which this 
grammar has been developed, a high premium is 
placed on parallel and consistent semantic 
representations between grammars for different 
languages.  Ensuring this parallelism enables the 
reuse of the same downstream technology, no 
matter which language is used as input.  
Integrating MRS representations parallel to 
those used in the ERG into the Japanese 
grammar took approximately 3 months.  Of 
course, semantic work is on-going, as every new 
construction treated needs to be given a suitable 
semantic representation.  For the most part, 
semantic representations developed for English 
were straightforwardly applicable to Japanese.  
This section provides a brief overview of those 
cases where the Japanese constructions we 
encountered led to innovations in the semantic 
representations and/or the correspondence 
between syntactic and semantic structures.  Due 
to space limitations, we discuss these analyses in 
general terms and omit technical details. 
2.l Nominalization and Verbal Nouns 
Nominalization is of course attested in English 
and across languages.  However, it is much more 
prevalent in Japanese than in English, primarily 
because of verbal nouns.  As noted in Section 
1.3 above, a verbal noun like benkyou 'study' can 
appear in syntactic contexts requiring nouns, or, 
in combination with a light verb, in contexts 
requiring verbs.  One possible analysis would 
provide two separate lexical entries, one with 
nominal and one with verbal semantics.  
However, this would not only be redundant 
(missing the systematic relationship between 
these uses of verbal nouns) but would also 
contradict the intuition that even in its nominal 
use, the arguments of benkyou are still present. 
Example 6: 
Nihongo no benkyou wo hajimeru. 
Japanese GEN study ACC begin 
'Someone begins the study of Japanese.' 
In order to capture this intuition, we opted for an 
analysis that essentially treats verbal nouns as 
underlyingly verbal.  The nominal uses are 
produced by a lexical rule which nominalizes the 
verbal nouns.  The semantic effect of this rule is 
to provide a nominal relation which introduces a 
variable which can in turn be bound by 
quantifiers. The nominal relation subordinates 
the original verbal relation supplied by the 
verbal noun.  The rule is lexical as we have not 
yet found any cases where the verb's arguments 
are clearly filled by phrases in the syntax.  If 
they do appear, it is with genitive marking (e.g., 
nihongo no in the example above).  In order to 
reduce ambiguity, we leave the relationship 
between these genitive marked NPs and the 
nominalized verbal noun underspecified.  There 
is nothing in the syntax to disambiguate these 
cases, and we find that they are better left to 
downstream processing, where there may be 
access to world knowledge. 
2.2 Numeral Classifiers 
As noted in Section1.5, the internal syntax of 
number names is surprisingly parallel between 
English and Japanese, but their external syntax 
differs dramatically. English number names can 
appear directly as modifiers of NPs and are 
treated semantically as adjectives in the ERG.  
Japanese number names can only modify nouns 
in combination with numeral classifiers. In 
addition, numeral classifier phrases can appear 
in NP positions (akin to partitives in English). 
Finally, some numeral-classifier-like elements 
do not serve the modifier function but can only 
head phrases that fill NP positions.   
This constellation of facts required the 
following innovations: a representation of 
numbers that doesn't treat them as adjectives (in 
MRS terms, a feature structure without the ARG 
feature), a representation of the semantic 
contribution of numeral classifiers (a relation 
between numbers and the nouns they modify, 
this time with an ARG feature), and a set of 
rules for promoting numeral classifier phrases to 
NPs that contribute the appropriate nominal 
semantics (underspecified in the case of ordinary 
numeral classifiers or specific in the case of 
words like en 'yen'). 
2.3 Relative Clauses and Adjectives 
The primary issue in the analysis of relative 
clauses and adjectives is the possibility of 
extreme ambiguity, due to several intersecting 
factors:  Japanese has rampant pro-drop and 
does not have any relative pronouns.  In 
addition, a head noun modified by a relative 
clause need not correspond to any gap in the 
relative clause, as shown by examples like the 
following (Matsumoto 1997): 
Example 7: 
atama ga yoku naru hon 
head NOM better become book 
'a book that makes one smarter' 
Therefore, if we were to posit an attributive 
adjective + noun construction (distinct from the 
relative clause + noun possibility) we would 
have systematic ambiguities for NPs like akai 
hon ('red book'), ambiguities which could never 
be resolved based on information in the 
sentence.  Instead, we have opted for a relative 
clause analysis of any adjective + noun 
combination in which the adjective could 
potentially be used predicatively.  Furthermore, 
because of gapless relative clauses like the one 
cited above, we have opted for a non-extraction 
analysis of relative clauses.2  
Nonetheless, the well-formedness constraints 
on MRS representations require that there be 
                                                     
2 There is in fact some linguistic evidence for 
extraction in some relative clauses in Japanese  (see 
e.g., Baldwin 2001).  However, we saw no practical 
need to allow for this possibility in our grammar, and 
particularly not one that would justify the increase in 
ambiguity. There is also evidence that some 
adjectives are true attributives and cannot be used 
predicatively (Yamakido 2000). These are handled by 
a separate adjective + noun rule restricted to just 
these cases. 
some relationship between the head noun and 
the relative clause.  We picked the topic relation 
for this purpose (following Kuno 1973).  The 
topic relation is introduced into the semantics by 
the relative clause rule.  As with main clause 
topics (which we also give a non-extraction 
analysis), we rely on downstream anaphora 
resolution to refine the relationship.   
2.4 Summary 
For the most part, semantic representations and 
the syntax-semantic interface already worked 
out in the ERG were directly applicable to the 
Japanese grammar.  In those cases where 
Japanese presented problems not yet 
encountered (or at least not yet tackled) in 
English, it was fairly straightforward to work out 
suitable MRS representations and means of 
building them up.  Both of these points illustrate 
the cross-linguistic validity and practical utility 
of MRS representations. 
3 Integration of a Morphological 
Analyzer 
As Japanese written text does not have word 
segmentation, a preprocessing system is 
required. We integrated ChaSen (Asahara & 
Matsumoto 2000), a tool that provides word 
segmentation as well as POS tags and 
morphological information such as verbal 
inflection. As the lexical coverage of ChaSen is 
higher than that of the HPSG lexicon, default 
part-of-speech entries are inserted into the 
lexicon. These are triggered by the part-of-
speech information given by ChaSen, if there is 
no existing entry in the lexicon. These specific 
default entries assign a type to the word that 
contains features typical to its part-of-speech. It 
is therefore possible to restrict the lexicon to 
those cases where the lexical information 
contains more than the typical information for a 
certain part-of-speech. This default mechanism 
is often used for different kinds of names and 
'ordinary' nouns, but also for adverbs, 
interjections and verbal nouns (where we 
assume a default transitive valence pattern).3 
                                                     
3 Kanayama et al (2000) use a similar mechanism for 
most words. They report only 105 grammar-inherent 
lexical entries.  
The ChaSen lexicon is extended with a domain-
specific lexicon, containing, among others, 
names in the domain of banking. 
For verbs and adjectives, ChaSen gives 
information about stems and inflection that is 
used in a similar way. The inflection type is 
translated to an HPSG type. These types interact 
with the inflectional rules in the grammar such 
that the default entries are inflected just as 
'known' words would be. 
In addition to the preprocessing done by 
ChaSen, an additional (shallow) preprocessing 
tool recognizes numbers, date expressions, 
addresses, email addresses, URLs, telephone 
numbers and currency expressions.  The output 
of the preprocessing tool replaces these 
expressions in the string with placeholders.  The 
placeholders are parsed by the grammar using 
special placeholder lexical entries. 
4 Robustness and Performance Issues 
The grammar is aimed at working with real-
world data, rather than at experimenting with 
linguistic examples. Therefore, robustness and 
performance issues play an important role. 
While grammar development is carried out in 
the LKB (Copestake 2002), processing (both in 
the application domain and for the purposes of 
running test suites) is done with the highly 
efficient PET parser (Callmeier 2000). Figures 1 
and 2 show the performance of PET parsing of 
hand-made and real data, respectively.

 One characteristic of real-world data is the 
variety of punctuation marks that occur and the 
potential for ambiguity that they bring. In our 
grammar, certain punctuation marks are given 
lexical entries and processed by grammar rules. 
Take, for example, quotation marks. Ignoring 
them (as done in most development-oriented 
grammars and smaller grammars), leads to a 
significant loss of structural information: 
Example 8: 
"Botan wo osu" to it-ta 
button ACC push COMPL say-past 
'Someone said: ?push the button. "?  
The formative to is actually ambiguous between 
a complementizer and a conjunction.  Since the 
phrase before to is a complete sentence, this 
string is ambiguous if one ignores the quotation 
marks.  With the quotation marks, however, only 
the complementizer to is possible.  Given the 
high degree of ambiguity inherent in broad-
coverage grammars, we have found it extremely 
useful to parse punctuation rather than ignore it. 
The domains we have been working on (like 
many others) contain many date and number 
expressions. While a shallow tool recognizes 
general structures, the grammar contains rules 
and types to process these.  
Phenomena occurring in semi-spontaneous 
language (email correspondence), such as 
interjections (e.g. maa 'well'), contracted verb 
forms (e.g. tabe-chatta < tabete-shimatta 
'(someone) ate it all up'), fragmentary sentences 
(e.g. bangou: 1265 'number: 1265') and NP 
fragments (e.g. bangou? 'number?') must be 
covered as well as the 'ordinary' complete 
sentences found in more carefully edited text.  
Our grammar includes types, lexical entries, and 
grammar rules for dealing with such phenomena. 
Perhaps the most important performance 
issue for broad coverage grammars is ambiguity. 
At one point in the development of this 
grammar, the average number of readings 
doubled in two months of work. We currently 
have two strategies for addressing this problem: 
First, we include a mechanism into the grammar 
rules that chooses left-branching rules in cases 
of compounds, genitive modification and 
conjuncts, as we don?t have enough lexical-
semantic information represented to choose the 
right dependencies in these cases.4 Secondly, we 
use a mechanism for hand-coding reading 
preferences among rules and lexical entries. 
                                                     
4Consider, for example, genitive modification: The 
semantic relationship between modifier and modifiee 
is dependent on their semantic properties: toukyou no 
kaigi - 'the meeting in Tokyo', watashi no hon - 'my 
book'. More lexical-semantic information is needed  
to choose the correct parse in more complex 
structures, such as in watashi no toukyou no imooto ? 
?My sister in Tokyo?. 
Restrictions like head-complement preferred to 
head-adjunct are quite obvious. Others require 
domain-specific mechanisms that shall be 
subject of further work.  Stochastic 
disambiguation methods being developed for the 
ERG by the Redwoods project at Stanford 
University (Oepen et al 2002) should be 
applicable to this grammar as well.  
5 Evaluation 
The grammar currently covers 93.4% of 
constructed examples for the banking domain 
(747 sentences) and 78.2% of realistic email 
correspondence data (316 sentences), concerning 
requests for documents. During three months of 
work, the coverage in the banking domain 
increased 48.49%. The coverage of the 
document request data increased 51.43% in the 
following two weeks.

a Japanese bank. The coverage was 61%. 91.2% 
of the parses output were associated with all 
well-formed MRSs. That means that we could 
get correct MRSs in 55.61% of all sentences.  
Conclusion 
We described a broad coverage Japanese 
grammar, based on HPSG theory. It encodes 
syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic information. 
The grammar system is connected to a 
morphological analysis system and uses default 
entries for words unknown to the HPSG lexicon.  
Some basic constructions of the Japanese 
grammar were described. As the grammar is 
aimed at working in applications with real-world 
data, performance and robustness issues are 
important.  
The grammar is being developed in a 
multilingual context, where much value is 
placed on parallel and consistent semantic 
representations.  The development of this 
grammar constitutes an important test of the 
cross-linguistic validity of the MRS formalism. 
The evaluation shows that the grammar is at 
a stage where domain adaptation is possible in a 
reasonable amount of time. Thus, it is a 
powerful resource for linguistic applications for 
Japanese. 
In future work, this grammar could be further 
adapted to another domain, such as the EDR 
newspaper corpus (including a headline 
grammar).  As each new domain is approached, 
we anticipate that the adaptation will become 
easier as resources from earlier domains are 
reused.  Initial evaluation of the grammar on 
new domains and the growth curve of grammar 
coverage should bear this out.
