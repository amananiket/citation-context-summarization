EXPLICIT SE~ENCES ARD SYNTACTIC COMPLEXITY

C~,  Pazd.s, Prance 
Preneh sentence (1) can be t rans la ted  in to  Engl ish  
e i ther  by (2) or (3) :  
( I ) Leslie est 6tudlante 
(2) Leslie Is a student 
(3) Leslie Is a woman and Leslle Is a student 
It is clear however that nelther (2) nor (3) can be consider- 
ed as an "exact" translation of (1). Sentence (2) does not 
carry the information that Leslie Is a woman and sentence (3) 
does not carry thls-information in the same way as (1 ) i  the 
fact ~hat Leslie is a woman Is presupposed by (1) whereas it 
i s  asser ted  by (3 ) .  In  other  words sentence  (3) i s  more exp lg -  
clt than sentence (1). Following Keenan (1973) we will say 
that a sentence S is more explicit than a sentence T I f f  S 
and T have the same consequences but some, presupposition o fT  
Is an assertion of S. 
Not only translations can be more explicit. Per instan- 
ce (5) is more explicit that (4) since (4) presupposes (6) 
wherens (5) esserts (6): 
(4) Blll knows that Sue has phoned 
(5) Sue has phoned and Bill knows whether Sue has phoned or 
not 
(6) Sue has phoned 
RouKhly, de f in ing  sentences  are, more exp l i c i t  than "de f ined"

th i s  paper i s  the fo l low ing  one: are  more exp l i c i t  sentences  
syntact i ca l l y  more complex ones (not i ce  that  (3) i s  syntact -  
i ca l l y  more eo~aplex than (I) as we l l  as (53 i s  more complex 
than (4)). 
We will show that at least for some simple languages 
this ie indeed the case: more explicit sentences are syntact- 
ically more complex. We will consider essentially proposit- 
ional categorial leaguage8, i.e. languages in which we have 
on ly  the category  o f  sentences  end the category  of  sentent ia l  
operators .  S ince we w i l l  d i s t ingu ish  two types  of  consequen-  
ces, .  p resuppos i ton8 and asser t ions ,  our language must con-  
ta in  s t rong ly  in tens iona l  operators .  A sentent ia l  operator  0 
i s  8a id to  be s t rong ly  in tens iona l  i f f  fo r  every  poss ib le  
world w and fo r  every  sentence  P, i f  O(P) i8  t rue  e t  X then 
there  ex is t  a sentence  P" wi th the same t ru th  va lue as P at  w 
end such that  O(P') i s  fa l se  a t  X (P end P" must be cont igent  
sentences) .  C lass ic  modal operators  ere  not  s t rong ly  in ten8-  
i One 1 ? 
Now a presuppos i t ion  can be de f ined  e8 s consequence 
which has an argument under the scope of  a s t rong ly  opaque 
operator  in  the presuppos ing sentence .  More prec i se ly  a sen-  
tence  S presuppose8 a sentence  T i f f  S semant ica l l y  imp l ies  
T and S i8  o f  the fo ist  O(R) where 0 i8  8 s t rong ly  in tens ion -  
e l  operator  and R and T have e co-~on argument. I t  can be 
shown that  P resuppos i t ion  de f ined  in  th i s  way i8  equ iva lent  
to  the c lass ica l  de f in i t ion  i f  one accepts  a negat ion  which 
preserves  in tene iona l i ty  (c f .  Zuber 1980~. Now g iven  ? s imple
