Abstract
We develop a model of preposition definitions
in a machine-readable dictionary using the
theory of labeled directed graphs and analyze
the resulting digraphs to determine a primitive
set of preposition senses. We characterize
these primitives and show how they can be
used to develop an inheritance hierarchy for
prepositions, representing the definitions by a
type and slots for its arguments. By analyzing
the definitions, we develop criteria for
disambiguating among the highly polysemous
primitives. We show how these criteria can be
used in developing the inheritance hierarchy
and how they may be used in assigning theta
roles to the objects of transitive verbs. Finally,
we describe the use of the disambiguation
criteria to parse and represent the meaning of
the prepositions as used in encyclopedia
articles.
1??????????????Introduction
Prepositions have generally been viewed as
function words to be discarded in many natural
language processing applications.  However,
prepositions have considerable importance as
identifiers of semantic relations tying various
elements of a sentence together. Since many
prepositions are highly polysemous, it is necessary
to develop a finer-grained analyses of their
meanings so that the semantic relations can be
more accurately identified.
We have modeled preposition definitions in a
dictionary using directed labeled graphs (digraphs)
to identify primitive preposition senses. We have
used the definitions from a machine-readable
version of a comprehensive English dictionary.
2??????????????Modeling Preposition Definitions
A preposition is ?a word governing, and usually
preceding, a noun or pronoun and expressing a
relation to another word or element in the clause.?
The definition of a preposition takes two principal
forms: (1) a usage expression characterizing the
relation or (2) an expression that can be substituted
for the preposition. A substituting preposition
definition usually consists of a prepositional phrase
(including both a preposition and a noun phrase)
and a terminating preposition (e.g., for around, one
definition is ?on every side of?).
2.1????????Headwords as Digraph Nodes
A digraph consists of nodes and directed arcs
between the nodes. In general, an arc should
correspond to a transitive relation. Modeling a
dictionary with a digraph entails assigning an
interpretation to the nodes and arcs. For our initial
model, we subsume all the definitions of a
preposition as one node in the digraph, labeled by
the preposition. An arc is drawn from one node
(e.g., of) to another (e.g., around) if the preposition
represented by the first node contributes a typed
meaning component with an open slot to the
preposition represented by the second node, e.g.,
?part-of of around? would arise from the
definition of around (?on every side of?).
Loosely, for our purposes, the terminating
preposition acts as a genus term in an ISA
hierarchy and makes it possible to use the results
from digraph theory to analyze the relationships
between definitions. In particular, digraph analysis
identifies definitional cycles and ?primitives? and
arranges the nodes into an inheritance hierarchy.
When a dictionary is modeled like this, digraph
theory (Harary, et al 1965) indicates that there is
a ?basis set? of nodes, which may be viewed as a

set of primitives.

Many prepositions are not used as the final
preposition of other preposition definitions
(specifically, their nodes have an outdegree of 0).
These are the leaves of the inheritance hierarchy.
When these are removed from the dictionary, other
prepositions will come to have outdegree 0, and
may in turn be removed. After all such iterations,
the remaining nodes are ?strongly connected?, that
is, for every node, there is a path to each other
node; a strong component is an equivalence class
and corresponds to a definitional cycle.
Each strong component may now be viewed as
a node. Some of these nodes also have the property
that they have outdegree 0; these strong component
may also be removed from the dictionary. This may
introduce a new round where individual nodes or
strong components have outdegree 0 and hence
may be removed from the dictionary.
After all removals, what is left is a set of one
or more strong components, each of which is
unreachable from the other. This final set is viewed
as the set of primitives. What this means is that we
have converted the preposition dictionary into an
inheritance hierarchy. If we can characterize the
meanings of the primitives, we can then inherit
these meanings in all the words and definitions that
have been previously been removed.
2.2????????Definitions as Digraph Nodes
This model of prepositions is very coarse, lumping
all senses into one node. Having reduced the set of
prepositions with this model, we can initiate a new
round of digraph analysis by disambiguating the
final preposition. In this new model, each node
represents a single sense and the arc between two
nodes indicates that one specific sense is used to
define one specific sense of another word (i.e.,
?contributes a typed meaning component with an
open slot to?).
With this new model, we can enter into a
further round of digraph analysis. In this round,
which proceeds as above, instead of a set of
primitive prepositions, the outcome will be a set of
primitive preposition definitions. However, as
mentioned above, preposition definitions come in
two flavors. The usage expressions are lumped into
the digraph analysis when a node corresponded to
all definitions, but they do not do so in the
definition digraph analysis.
3   NODE Prepositions
As the data for the digraph analysis, we began with
the 155 prepositions identified in a
machine-readable dictionary (The New Oxford
Dictionary of English, 1998) (NODE). Additional
prepositions are found as unmarked phrases under
noun or adjective headwords, but not so labeled,
e.g., in spite of under the headword spite. To find
these prepositions, we developed a more rigorous
specification of a preposition signature. A
preposition definition is either (1) a preposition; (2)
a prepositional phrase + a preposition; (3) (an
optional leading string) + a transitive present
participle; or (4) a leading string + an infinitive of
a transitive verb. This led to the addition of 218
phrasal prepositions, for a total of 373 entries, with
847 senses, shown in the Appendix.
We may have missed other subsenses that have
a preposition signature. In all likelihood, these
patterns would enter the digraph analysis as nodes
with outdegree 0 and hence would be eliminated in
the first stage of the primitive analysis.
3.1????????Substitutable Definitions
Most preposition definitions are in a form that can
be substituted for the preposition. For a sense of
against (?as protection from?), with an example
?he turned up his collar against the wind?, the
definition can be fully substituted to obtain ?he
turned up his collar as protection from the wind.?
The preposition definitions were parsed,
putting them into a generic sentence frame, usually
?Something is [prepdef] something.? For example,
the definition of ahead of (?in store for?) would be
parsed as ?Something is in store for something.?
1
The determination of the ?basis set? of a digraph is
NP-complete However, as pointed out in (Litkowski,
1988), this process will not involve millions of
nodes. In our implementation of the algorithm for
finding strong components (Even 1980), the digraph
analysis of prepositions takes less than two seconds.
For definitions with a selectional restriction on the
preposition?s object (identifiable by a parenthesized
expression in the definition), the parentheses were
removed in the sentence frame, e.g., above (?higher
than (a specified amount, rate, or norm)?) would be
parsed as ?Something is higher than a specified
amount, rate, or norm.?
The parse tree would then be analyzed to
obtain the final preposition, treated as the
hypernym. For definitions containing a verb at the
end, e.g., another sense of above (?overlooking?,
parsed as ?Something is overlooking something?)
would yield ?overlooking? as the hypernym.
3.2????????Usage Note Definitions
Many preposition definitions are not substitutable,
but rather characterize how the preposition is used
syntactically and semantically. One sense of of
(?expressing the relationship between a part and a
whole?) characterizes the semantic relationship (in
this case, the partitive). One of its subsenses (?with
the word denoting the part functioning as the head
of the phrase?) indicates syntactic characteristics
when this sense is used. These definitions are not
parsed and do not lead to the identification of
hypernyms. As shown below, these definitions will
emerge as the primitives.
3.3????????Definition Modifications
The automatic generation of preposition hypernyms
was less than perfect. We examined each definition
and made various hand modifications. Our editing
process included hand entry of hypernyms: adding
or modifying automatically generated hypernyms,
making hypernymic links for ?non-standard?
entries (e.g., making upon the hypernym of ?pon),
and creating hypernymic links from a subsense to
a supersense
4 Digraph Analysis Results
The digraph analysis described above eliminated
309 of the 373 entries. The remaining 64 entries
were grouped into 25 equivalence classes, as
shown in Table 1 and portrayed in Figure 1 in the
appendix. Figure 1 shows how these strong
components are related to one another. The strong
components highlighted in the table are primitives.
Seven of the primitive strong components (in, of,
than, as, from, as far as, and including) have
paths into strong component 12. Strong
components 14 to 18 arise essentially from the
primitive strong component of. The eighth strong
component (23) and other entries defined by words
in this class exist somewhat independently.
It would seem that the largest strong
component (12, with 33 entries) should be broken
down into smaller classes; this would occur in the
sense-specific digraph analysis. Specialized senses
of with, by, to, for, and before give rise to
definitional cycles within this strong component.
In addition to the strong components shown
above, 62 non-prepositional primitives have been
identified. The first 42 of these primitives were
used in defining entries that were removed in the
first phase of the digraph analysis. The 20
beginning with affect were used in defining entries
in the primitive strong components.
There are 155 preposition senses (out of 847)
that are defined solely with usage notes. Of these,
71 are subsenses, leaving 74 senses in 26 entries
(as shown in Table 3) that can be considered the
most primitive senses and deserving initial focus in
attempting to lay out the meanings of all
preposition senses.
5 Interpretation of Results
The digraph analysis of prepositions provides
additional perspectives in understanding their
meanings and their use. To begin with, the analysis
enables us to identify definitional cycles and move
toward the creation of an inheritance hierarchy.
The large number of senses that have verb
hypernymic roots indicates a close kinship between
prepositions and verbs, suggesting that a verb
hierarchy may provide an organizing principle for
prepositions (discussed further below). The large
number of senses rooted in usage notes, which
essentially characterize how these senses function,
encapsulates the role of prepositions as ?function
words;? however, as described below, these
functions are not simply syntactic in nature, but
also capture semantic roles.

The frequency with which the various
prepositions are used as hypernyms in defining
other prepositions reveals something about their
relative importance.  The most frequent hypernyms
are of (175), to (74), than (45), with (44), by (39),
from (30), for (22), as (20), and in (12). These
prepositions correspond to the primitives identified
in Table 1, as well as those with the largest number
of usage notes shown in Table 3.

(1), out of (1), over (1), than (2), this side of (1), to (7),
towards (1), under (1), up to (1), with (4)
On the other hand, the relative frequencies may
not correspond well with our intuitions about a
semantic classification of prepositions. (Quirk, et
al. 1985) give the greatest prominence to spatial
and temporal meanings, followed by the
cause/purpose spectrum, the means/agentive
spectrum, accompaniment, and support and
opposition, and finally, several miscellaneous
categories. In the semantic relations hierarchy of
the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)
(Unified Medical Language System 2002), five
general types of associations are identified:
physical, spatial, functional (causal), temporal, and
conceptual. The leaves of the UMLS hierarchy are
realized as verbs, but have a strong correspondence
to the classification in (Quirk, et al 1985).
In our identification of primitives, including the
usage notes, spatial and temporal senses are
conspicuously reduced in significance, while a
comparative term (than) seems to have a much
greater presence. The explanation for these two
observations is that (1) many of the basic spatial
and temporal prepositions were located in the
largest strong component (12 in Table 1) or were
derived from it and (2) many of the senses of these
spatial and temporal prepositions have ?than? as
hypernym. This suggests that a considerable
amount of the meaning of such prepositions lie
principally in describing relative position in a
spatio-temporal continuum.
6 Developing an Inheritance
Hierarchy
As suggested earlier, the next stage of digraph
analysis involves disambiguating the hypernymic
preposition, so that individual nodes of the digraph
represent senses or concepts. As suggested in
(Litkowski, 1978), these nodes will consist of a
gloss and the various lexicalizations the concept,
much like the synsets in WordNet (Fellbaum
1998). A prototypical case would be strong
component 23 which may be lexicalized as {by
reason of, because of, on account of}; our
analysis suggests that, in this case, some further
characterization of the usage of this concept by the
lexicographers would be desirable, since otherwise
we have only a vicious definitional cycle.
The creation of the hierarchy would involve
assigning a label or type to the individual concepts
and then characterizing the information that is to be
inherited. The typology can be developed from the
bottom up, rather than developing some a priori
structure. In other words, since the digraph
analysis has identified primitive senses, these
provide an appropriate starting point. Each sense
can be examined on its own merits with an initial
assignment of a type and later examination of the
full set of primitives for organization into a data-
driven set of types and subtypes.
As to what gets inherited, we begin with the
fact that in general, each preposition has two
arguments, arg1 (the object of the preposition) and
arg2 (the attachment point, or head, of the
prepositional phrase). We may take these as the
two slots associated with each representation and
we may give the slots names according to the type
(or just implicitly understand that a type has
particular types of arguments). When considering
the general structure of a non-primitive preposition
definition (a prepositional phrase with an ending
preposition), the NP of the prepositional phrase is
the value of arg2. This value will be useful in
disambiguating the hypernymic preposition (as
described in the next section). In considering the
slots for prepositions whose hypernym is a verb (as
identified in Table 2), arg1 will be the object of the
verb.
7 Definition Use
To describe the process by which preposition
senses will be disambiguated and also how the
representations of their meaning will be used in
processing text, Table 4 shows the definitions for
?of?, the most frequently used hypernym and
perhaps the second most frequent word in the
English language. In the table, we have assigned a
type to each of nine main senses. In the definition
column, the main sense is given first, with any
subsenses given in parentheses, separated by
semicolons if there is more than one subsense.
First, we consider the disambiguation of
hypernyms in preposition definitions, that is, those
whose final word is ?of?. One sense of ?after? is
?in imitation of? (e.g., ?a mystery story after
Poe?); examining the table suggests that this is a
deverbal use of ?of?, where the object of ?after?
would be the object of the underlying verb of
?imitation?, so that when ?after? is used in this
sense, its arg1 is the object of the verb ?imitate?. A
sense of ?on behalf of? is ?as a representative of?;
this is the partitive sense, so that arg1 of ?on
behalf of? is a ?whole?. Finally, one sense of ?like?
is ?characteristic of?; this is the predicative
deverbal. Carrying out this process throughout the
preposition definitions will thus enable us not only
to disambiguate them, but also to identify
characteristics of their arguments when the
prepositions they define are used in some text.
In addition, prepositions very often appear at
the end of the definitions of transitive verbs. For
example, one sense of ?accommodate? is ?provide
lodging or sufficient space for?, where the sense of
?for? is ?to the benefit of?, where ?of? is used in
the genitive sense (i.e., ?someone?s or something?s
benefit). With this interpretation, we can say that
the object of ?accommodate? is a benefactive and
that a benefactive role has been lexicalized into the
meaning of ?accommodate?. With disambiguation
of the final preposition in such definitions, we will
be able to characterize the objects of these verbs
with some theta role.
The ultimate objective of this analysis of
prepositions is to be able to characterize their
occurrences in processing text. Specifically, we
would like to disambiguate a preposition, so that
we can assign each instance a type and characterize
its arguments. In this way, processing a text would
identify the semantic relations present in the text.
We have performed some initial investigations into
the viability of this goal.
We have begun implementing a discourse
analysis of encyclopedia articles. At the base of
this analysis, we are identifying and characterizing
discourse entities, essentially the noun phrases. Our
Table 4. Definitions of ?of?
Type Definition (Subsense(s))
1. Partitive relationship between a part and a whole (part functioning as head; after a number, quantifier, or
partitive noun, with the word denoting the whole functioning as the head of the phrase)
2. Scale-Value relationship between a scale or measure and a value (an age)
3. Genitive association between two entities, typically one of belonging (relationship between an author, artist, or
composer and their works collectively)
4. Direction relationship between a direction and a point of reference
5. Hypernym relationship between a general category and the thing being specified which belongs to such a
category (governed by a noun expressing the fact that a category is vague)
6. Deverbal relationship between an abstract concept having a verb-like meaning and (a noun denoting the subject
of the underlying verb; the second noun denotes the object of the underlying verb; head of the phrase
is a predicative adjective)
7. Indirect Object relationship between a verb and an indirect object (a verb expressing a mental state; expressing a
cause)
8. Substance the material or substance constituting something

analysis includes identification of the syntactic role
and semantic type of the noun phrases, along with
attributes such as number and gender. The analysis
also includes resolution of anaphora, coreferences,
and definite noun phrases. The modules analyzing
the discourse entities come after a full parse of
each sentence. We have now introduced a module
to examine prepositions and build semantic
relations. The results of these analyses generate an
XML representation of discourse segments,
discourse entities, and semantic relations, each with
an accompanying set of attributes.
Our implementation of the semantic relation
module has identified several issues of interest.
First, the characterization of the semantic relation
needs to come after the object of the prepositional
phrase has been analyzed for its discourse entity
properties. For example, if the object is an
anaphor, the antecedent needs to be established.
Second, the attachment points of the prepositional
phrase need to be identified; our parser establishes
a stack of possible attachment points (index
positions in the sentence), with the most likely at
the top of the stack. (Attachment tests could be
implemented at this point, although we have not yet
done so.) The attachment point is necessary to
identify the arguments to be analyzed.
Having identified the arguments, the
information subject to analysis includes the literal
arguments (both the full phrase and their roots), the
parts of speech of the arguments, any semantic
characterizations of the arguments that are
available (such as the WordNet file number), and
access to the dictionary definitions of the root
heads. The analysis for the semantic relation is
specific to the preposition. We are encoding a
semantic relation type and one or more tests with
each sense.  Some of these tests are simple, such as
string matches, and others are complex, involving
function calls to examine semantic relationships
between the arguments.
In the case of ?of?, the first test was whether
arg2 is an adjective, in which case we assigned a
type of ?predicative?. Next, if arg2 was a vague
general category (?form?, ?type?, or ?kind?), we
set the type to ?hypernymic?. If neither of these
conditions was satisfied, we looked up the root of
arg2 in WordNet to determine if the word had a
?part-of? relation (resulting in a ?partitive? type)
or ?member-of? relation (resulting in a
?hypernymic? type). If a type had not been
established by this point, we used the WordNet file
number to establish an intermediate type. Thus, for
example, if arg2 was an ?action? or ?process?
word, we set the type for the semantic relation to
?deverbal?; for a ?quantity?, we set the type to
?partitive?. Finally, we can make use of the
definition for arg1 (parsed to identify its
hypernym) to determine if arg2 is the hypernym of
arg1. When these criteria are not sufficient, we
label the type ?undetermined?.
In our encyclopedia project, we parse and
process the articles to generate XML files. We then
apply an XSL transformation to extract all the
semantic relations that were identified, including
the preposition, the type assigned, and the values of
Figure 1. Basis Digraph of NODE Prepositions
arg1 and arg2. We can sort on these fields to
facilitate analysis of our success and to identify
situations in need of further work.
After the initial implementation, we were able
to assign semantic relations to 50 percent of the
instances of ?of?, although many of these were
given incorrect assignments. However, the method
is useful for identifying instances for which
improved analysis is necessary. For example, we
can identify where improved characterization of
discourse entities is needed, or where additional
lexical information might be desirable (such as how
to identify a partitive noun).
8 Conclusions and Further Work
We have shown that a digraph analysis of
preposition definitions provides a useful organizing
principle for analyzing and understanding the
meanings of prepositions. The definitions
themselves provide sufficient information for
developing an inheritance hierarchy within a typed-
feature structure arrangement and also provide a
rich set of criteria for disambiguating among the
many senses. By incorporating these criteria in a
text processing system, it is possible to develop
semantic triples that characterize intrasentential
relationships among discourse entities. Further, the
characterization of meanings may prove useful in
identifying theta roles implied by the ending
prepositions of transitive verb definitions 
Much work remains to be done to develop the
full set of information for all prepositions. We
believe we have established a suitable framework
for carrying out this work.
