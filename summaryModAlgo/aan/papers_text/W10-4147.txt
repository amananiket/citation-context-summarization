Abstract 
This paper gives an overview of China 
Center for Information Industry Devel-
opment(CCID) participating in the 2th 
Evaluation on Chinese parsing. CCID 
has taken part in the subtask of the 
analysis of complete sentences. The sys-
tem participating in the above Evaluation 
is a rule-based Chinese parser, and its 
basic information is described in the pa-
per, and its experimental situation for the 
Evaluation has been analyzed. 
1 Introduction 
Parsing is one of key issues in natural language 
processing, and its main task is to automatically 
identify the syntactic structure of sentences (syn-
tactic units and their syntactic relations between 
units). The study of parsing is of critical impor-
tance for machine translation, natural language 
understanding, information extraction and auto-
matic summarization of natural language proc-
essing systems. Syntactic analysis methods in-
clude methods of use of corpus annotation in-
formation in syntactic analysis and the rule-
based methods such as: Shift-Reduce Parsing 
and Chart Parsing technology to study the Chi-
nese syntactic structure[1]. In this paper, the 
Chinese parser which China Electronic Informa-
tion Industry Development (CCID) uses to par-
ticipate in the 2th Evaluation on Chinese Parsing 
is described. 
2 System 
The Chinese parser which CCID uses to 
participate in the 2th Evaluation on Chinese 
Parsing serves as a component of a practical 
Chinese-English machine translation system, 
and uses rule-based method, and uses statistical 
approach for unknown word recognition. The 
Chinese parser includes the following three 
modules: 1) Chinese word segmenting, 2) 
Chinese POS tagging, 3) Chinese parsing. The 
form of rules in the Chinese parser is production 
rule. The rules include general rules and specific 
rules. The general rules are indexed by POS or 
phrase types, and specific rules are indexed by 
Chinese word or Chinese phrase. There are 
multi-passes during Chinese parsing, and the 
result of the parsing of a Chinese sentence is a 
Chinese syntactic tree. The CCID?s Chinese 
parser includes 1,930,000 entries in the basic 
dictionaries and 6,000 rules in knowledge base. 
Parts of speech and syntactic elements of the 
output of the CCID?s Chinese parser are marked 
by its own set of markup symbols, and these 
markup symbols are mapped to parts of speech 
tags and syntactic component tags defined by 
CIPS-ParsEval-2009 by a conversion function. 
The CCID?s tag set is mainly same as the set of 
CIPS-ParsEval-2009 except the used tag 
characters. For example, in the CCID?s tag set, 
the tag of noun phrase is NP, and the tag of verb 
phrase is VP, and the tag of preposition phrase is 
IP; for the tags in CIPS-ParsEval-2009, the tag 
of noun phrase is np, and the tag of verb phrase 
is vp, and the tag of preposition phrase is pp. 
3 Experiment 
CCID participated in the 2th Evaluation on Chi-
nese Parsing, and timely submitted parsing out-
put of test sentences of the syntactic analysis. 
The Test Group returned to a very unfortunate 
message: "find that the results presented in the 
original segmentation of data are automatically 
merged, so can not give the appropriate evalua-
tion of data." 
Here are two specific examples: 
 
Original input 1: 
1  ??  ???  ?  ?  ??  ???  ?  ?
?  ???  ?  ???  ?  ??  ??  ?  ?
?  ?  ??  ?  ?  ??  ?  ??  ?  ??  
??  ?  ?  ?  ??  ???  ?   
 
Parsing output 1: 
1 [zj [dj [dj [np ?????/n ] [vp [pp ?/p 
[np [np [np ?????/n ] ?/c [np ????
?/n ] ] ?/uO [np ???/n ] ] ] [vp [vp ??/v ] 
[np [np [np [np [np ??/n ] ?/wD [np ??/n ] 
?/c [np ??/n ] ] ?/uO ] ?/uJDE [np ??
/n ] ] ?/wD [np [np ??/n ] ?/uJDE [np ??
??/n ] ] ] ] ] ] ?/wP [dj ?/r [vp [vp [dp ?/d ] 
[vp ??/v ] ] [np ???/n ] ] ] ] ?/wE ]  
 
Original input 183: 
183  ????  ?  ???  ???  ??  ?
?  ?  ??  ??  ??  ?  ??  ??  ?  ?  
?  ?  ???  ??  ??  ?  ??  ?  ??  
??  ???  ??  ?   
 
Parsing output 183: 
183 [zj [dj [dp [dp ????/d ] ?/wP ] [dj 
[np [np [np [ap ???/a ???/a ] [np ???
?/n ] ] ?/wD [np [ap ??/a ] [np ????
/n ] ] ?/wD [np ????/n ] ] ?/uO ] [pp ?/c 
[dj [np [np ?/n ] [np ???????/n ] ] [vp 
[dp ??/d ] [vp [dp ?/d ] [vp [vp ??/vM [vp 
??/v ] ] [np ?????/n ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ?/wE ]  
 
Reasons for these phenomena are: ?????
???????????????????
??????????????????
??????????????????
??and some other entries have already existed 
as separate entries in the basic dictionaries of the 
CCID?s Chinese parser. In parsing, these entries 
act as separate entries and the results also show 
up as separate entries. This occurs because of the 
larger basic dictionary(1.93 million entries), and 
these entries have the corresponding English 
translations on the expression. For a practical 
Chinese parser, a large number of phrases that 
already exist in the basic vocabularies can re-
duce the burden of parsing, and are useful for 
improving the success rate of Chinese syntactic 
analysis. But this adds extra burden to evaluation 
programs. When participating in the next Chi-
nese parsing evaluation, some phrases that have 
existed in the basic dictionaries of Chinese 
parser will be divided to further analyze their 
internal syntactic structures to facilitate the 
evaluation process. 
After receiving the notice that a re-evaluation 
can be done by the Evaluation Group to help 
CCID to evaluate the effectiveness of the modi-
fication of the parsing model, the following steps 
are carried out for the convenience of the evalua-
tion programs: 
1) Compare all words in the test task with 
CCID?s Chinese parser, and find out the 
information for the words from CCID?s 
Chinese parser, and delete all other 
words from the Chinese parser to avoid 
the situation that some Chinese words 
are combined when parsing. 
2) Modify parsing rules that contain opera-
tions of deleting words to avoid the de-
letion of Chinese words in the parsing 
results. 
3) Re-parse Chinese sentences in the test 
task. 
4) Submit the result of the parsing to the 
Evaluation Group to evaluate. 
The re-evaluation result is as the following:

4 Discussion 
Chinese parsing is an important basic research 
for Chinese information processing research, and 
gets the attention of many researchers. Current 
research focuses on the research on syntactic 
knowledge acquisition based on the corpus, and 
its goal is to use statistical methods from a good 
tree bank annotation to learn the parsing needed 
knowledge, and the trained parser also promotes 
the work of automatic/semi-automatic annota-
tion to corpus. Statistical methods have an ad-
vantage for fine-grained knowledge of the lan-
guage than the rule method, and can automati-
cally learn knowledge from the annotated corpus, 
and is attractive and worthy of research. 
 Meanwhile, many Chinese parsers that have 
the background for the practical application use 
the rule-based approach, and, in addition to the 
accumulation of knowledge in the process of 
manual knowledge acquisition, also use statisti-
cal methods to help get the phrases from the 
corpus, and also include the translation equiva-
lents acquired automatically for machine transla-
tion. An important direction of development for 
these systems is to find ways to learn a lot of 
phrase knowledge from the corpus, which can 
greatly reduce the difficulties encountered in the 
ambiguity resolution to improve the accuracy of 
syntactic analysis. For Chinese-English machine 
translation system, the difficulty will be signifi-
cantly lower after adding a large number of 
phrases and their translation to the system, and 
as a result, some syntactic structure ambiguities 
are eliminated, and many phrases are translated 
as a whole and the readability of the translation 
also are improved. 
An important development trend of natural 
language processing is that corpus is considered 
as processing objects and sources of knowledge 
acquisition. Rule approach has proven to be dif-
ficult to the task of processing large-scale real 
corpus, so the researchers turn to the help of sta-
tistical methods, and many experiments prove 
that statistical methods indeed have made great 
progress. But the statistical method has its inher-
ent shortcomings, and statistical methods alone 
can hardly reach expectations of the perfect goal 
of natural language processing. Thus, Many re-
searchers begin to explore ways of combination 
of statistical methods and rules, and have made 
some progress, but there is still a long way to go 
from the ultimate goal of natural language proc-
essing (computer can fully understand the nature 
of human language). The current trend of inte-
gration of empiricism and rationalism in natural 
language processing is a significant phenomenon, 
and its development will produce a lot of valu-
able results, and natural language processing 
research and applications will benefit from it.  
The CCID?s future research will focus on 
methods of automatically extracting knowledge 
of Chinese phrases and their translations. These 
methods will be mainly statistical methods, 
combining with some of the rules means to fa-
cilitate access to single-language knowledge and 
improve the correct translation rate. Progress of 
the research in this regard will be helpful for our 
practical machine translation system to improve 
the quality of translation. At the same time, it 
has a direct role in improving the quality of Chi-
nese parser.
