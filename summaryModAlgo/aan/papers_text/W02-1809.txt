Abstract 
For readers of English text who know some 
Chinese, Pinyin codes that spell out Chinese 
names are often ambiguous as to their 
original Chinese character representations if 
the names are new or not well known.  For 
English-Chinese cross language retrieval, 
failure to accurately translate Pinyin names 
in a query to Chinese characters can lead to 
dismal retrieval effectiveness. This paper 
presents an approach of extracting Pinyin 
names from English text, suggesting 
translations to these Pinyin using a database 
of names and their characters with usage 
probabilities, followed with IR techniques 
with a corpus as a disambiguation tool to 
resolve the translation candidates. 
Introduction 
It is important for many applications to be able 
to identify and extract person names in text.  For 
English, capital letter beginning of a word is an 
important clue to spot names, in addition to 
other contextual ones.  When an English story 
refers to a foreign person, it is relatively easy to 
represent the person?s name if the alphabets 
have approximate correspondences between the 
languages. When it refers to a Chinese person, 
this is not possible because Chinese language 
does not use alphabets. The most popular 
method for this purpose is Pinyin coding (see, 
for example, the conversion project at the 
Library of Congress website (2002)), China?s 
official method of using English to spell out 
Chinese character pronounciations according to 
the Beijing Putonghua convention. Chinese 
characters are monosyllabic, and the large 
majority of them has one sound (ignoring tones) 
and hence one code. However, given a Pinyin it 
usually maps to multiple characters. Such an 
English Pinyin name raises ambiguity about the 
original Chinese characters that it refers to and 
hence the person.  If the name is well known, 
such as Mao ZeDong, this is not an issue; if the 
name is less frequently seen, one would like to 
see or confirm the actual Chinese characters.  
    The situation is similar to many Chinese word 
processing systems that use Pinyin as one of 
their input methods.  When a Pinyin is typed 
(sometimes with tonal denotation), many 
candidate characters will be displayed for the 
user to select.  The character list can be ordered 
based on a language model, Chen & Lee (2000), 
or on the user?s past habit.  When one comes 
across names as input however, a language 
model is not as helpful because practically any 
character combination is possible for names.   
    Pinyin names also present difficulties in a 
cross language information retrieval (CLIR) 
scenario.  Here, an English query is given to 
retrieve Chinese documents, and Pinyin names 
could be present as part of the query.  In general, 
one can have three approaches to CLIR as 
discussed in Grefenstette (1998): translate the 
Chinese documents to English and do retrieval 
matching in English; translate the English query 
to Chinese and do matching in Chinese; or 
translate both to an intermediate representation. 
With the first approach, one could use standard 
table lookup to map the characters of a Chinese 
name to Pinyin after identifying a name for 
extraction. Chen and Bai (1998), Sun et.al. 
(1994) have shown that this extraction process is 
not trivial since Chinese writing has no white 
space to delimit names or words. A more 
general difficulty is that the document collection 
may not be under a user?s control, but available 
for retrieval purposes only. This makes 
document translation to the query language (or 
to an intermediate language) not suitable.  A 
more flexible approach is to translate a query to 
Chinese and do retrieval in Chinese.  This has 
been the more popular method to use for CLIR 
in TREC experiments: Voorhees and Harman 
(2001). Whichever translation direction one 
chooses, a bilingual dictionary is essential. This 
dictionary however can be expected to be 
incomplete, especially with person names. 
Missing their translations can adversely impact 
on CLIR effectiveness.  This raises the question 
of how to render Pinyin names into Chinese 
characters for translingual retrieval purposes. 
    In the recent NTCIR-2 English-Chinese cross 
language experiments, Eguchi et.al. (2001), 
quite a few queries have names.  Kwok (2001) 
found that these lead to good monolingual 
retrieval because the names are quite specific 
and have good retrieval properties.  On the other 
hand, for CLIR that starts with English queries, 
not being able to translate Pinyin names 
correctly leads to substantial deficit in 
effectiveness. This causes comparisons with 
monolingual results particularly dismal. 
    In this paper, we propose an approach to 
resolve the characters from a Pinyin code.  It is 
based on: 1) a rule-based procedure to extract 
Pinyin codes for Chinese person names in 
English text; 2) a database for proposing 
candidate Chinese character sequences for a 
Pinyin code based on usage probabilities; and 3) 
a target collection and IR techniques as a 
confirmation tool for resolving or narrowing 
down the proposed candidates. These are 
described in Sections 1, 2, and 3 respectively.  
Section 4 presents some CLIR results and a 
measure of the effectiveness of our procedures. 
    We like to stress that even if one obtains the 
correct Chinese characters for a Pinyin, they can 
still refer to different persons with the same 
name. We do not address this issue here. 
1 Pinyin Name Extraction 
Chinese person names in Pinyin have fairly 
predictable formats such as: first alphabet of the 
family name (surname) is capitalized, as is the 
first word (or second word) of a given name. 
Two-syllable given names may appear as one 
word or two. The latter may be hyphenated, a 
practice popular in places such as Taiwan or 
Hong Kong. Thus, one may find Chairman 
Mao?s name in any of the following formats: 
Mao Ze Dong  
Mao ZeDong  Mao Zedong 
Mao Ze-Dong  Mao Ze-dong 
Some publications also place the given name in 
front of the surname to agree with Western name 
convention. This style is supported but not used 
in this paper.  
    While the surname character is pretty much 
closed, the given name is not.  It is well known 
that the most popular Chinese surnames number 
to about 100. Including less frequent ones bring 
the number to about 400 which we use: see 
Hundred Surname website (2002). Sun, et.al. 
(1994) reported over 700 surnames in their 
studies when additional infrequent ones are 
included.  Other than for a few exceptions, this 
set al have unique Pinyin codes. These surname 
codes constitute an important clue for spotting a 
name sequence. The capitalized word(s), and the 
monosyllabic nature of words immediately after 
(or before) the surname give further support of 
its existence.  We also loosen name definition to 
detect entries that have a hyphen but without a 
surname. Some rare surnames can be two 
syllables long, and often pair with one syllable 
given names. A woman may include her own 
family name in addition to her husband?s. For 
our current study, we limit testing to a sequence 
of two to three Pinyin syllables only. This seems 
sufficient for the large majority of names 
encountered. Fig.1 shows our procedure to 
identify possible Pinyin names without the need 
of a training corpus or a name dictionary. 
2 Mapping Pinyin Name to Chinese 
To suggest Chinese characters for the detected 
Pinyin, we downloaded about 200K Chinese 
names. This is augmented with another ? 
million Chinese name usage isolated from the 
TREC-6 Chinese collection using BBN?s 
S G G
GG / G-G
Gg / G-g
S-G / S-g
Figure 1: Pinyin Name Detection Algorithm
(S,G = surname & given name syllable with upper-case  
first character; Gg, G-g = concatenated or hyphenated
syllables, second one with lower-case)
IdentiFinder (see Section 4). Last name and 
given name/characters are stored separately to 
form a database of name usage with frequencies. 
Two-character given names are stored both 
ways: as a single entry (observed) and as two 
separate characters. Observed usage items have 
their frequencies muliplied by a large factor to 
separate it from the unobserved type. A potential 
Pinyin surname is mapped to a set of possible 
characters. Existence of such characters in this 
surname database is the first step to decide that 
one may have a possible name sequence.  
Otherwise, we assume the Pinyin is not a name.   
    Knight and Graehl (1997) have proposed to 
compose a set of weighted finite state 
transducers to solve the much more complicated 
problem of back-transliteration from Japanese 
Katakana to English. Their concern includes all 
types of source Katakana terms (not just names), 
corruptions due to OCR, approximations due to 
modeling of English, Japanese pronunciations, 
and a language model for English.  Proposing 
Chinese characters for Pinyin is like back-
transliteration and can also be viewed 
probabilistically. Some unique considerations 
however lead to a much simpler problem.  
    Given an English Pinyin name E=EsEg 
(surname Es, given name Eg), our concern is to 
find the best Chinese name character sequence 
C=CsCg that maximizes P(C|E), or equivalently 
P(E|C)*P(C). Since surnames (Es,Eg) and given-
names (Cs,Cg) can be considered independent, 
this probability can be re-written as: 
P(Es|C)*P(Cs)*P(Eg|C)*P(Cg).The conditioning 
on C can be replaced by Cs and Cg respectively 
since Chinese given names Cg should not 
influence English surname Es, and Cs should not 
influence Eg.  As discussed before, other than a 
few exceptions Chinese characters have unique 
Pinyin, and hence P(Es|Cs) and P(Eg|Cg) is 
deterministic. Maximizing P(C|E) is equivalent 
to maximizing P(Cs?)*P(Cg?), where Cs? and 
Cg? are sets of characters mapping from Es and 
Eg respectively. These probabilities are 
obtainable from frequencies in our database.  
Given names are limited to one or two syllables. 
In the latter case, the two characters are also 
assumed independent, and estimates of P(Cg?) 
are smoothed between character pairs and their 
corresponding singles. 
    To illustrate, we use the Pinyin: Jiang ZeMin 
(correct Chinese name is 4??) as an example. 
This spelling is confirmed as a name because 
?Jiang? maps to five possible surnames, and 
?ZeMin? obeys given-name format, and have 
corresponding characters. Each surname 
character and all possible combinations of the 
given name characters are considered and 
probabilities evaluated based on the database of 
name usage frequencies. The top 16 candidates 
and estimated probabilities produced from our 
procedure are shown below: 
 
.763 
 .119  .110  .005  
.001  .001  .001  .000  
.000  .000  .000  .000  
.000        .000  .000   .000   
 
The probabilities are skewed because the first 
(correct) name has large usage frequency in the 
training data. However, every candidate is a 
possible name irrespective of probabilities 
because of the idiosyncracies of name forming. 
    Quite often, some places or organizations also 
sound like names.  These will also be translated 
(see example in Section 4).  A couple of notable 
failures are strings like ?So China?, which our 
procedure decodes as a name ?So Chi-na?, ?So? 
being a legitimate surname in Wade-Giles 
convention. ?Hong Kong? also passes our test 
with  candidates: ?) w? O etc. A 
?stoplist? of such string patterns is employed to 
partially alleviate these errors. 
3 Pinyin Name Resolution 
Once candidate names for a Pinyin are available, 
one may output the top n ranked items as 
answers. However, selecting names based on 
probability may not be the best strategy. Quite 
often, people deliberately choose rare characters 
for naming purpose because they want to be 
differentiated from the usual run-of-the-mill 
names. Our strategy is to use IR techniques with 
a text collection to help in name selection.  For 
cross language retrieval, it is especially helpful 
to use the target retrieval collection for 
resolution.  This ensures that a translated name 
exists in the collection for retrieval.  For general 
application, one could employ domain-relevant 
collections. Moreover, one can also use the 
occurrence frequency of the names in the 
collection to help narrow down the candidates: 
i.e. the higher the frequency, the more probable 
that the name is the intended one.  This has the 
advantage that selection is tailored more to the 
application, and less dependent on the name 
character database of Section 2. When the 
collection is well chosen, this process can 
whittle down the candidates to just a few with 
good accuracy. 
4 Experimental Studies 
We performed two studies to demonstrate our 
Pinyin resolution strategy.   The first is to repeat 
retrieval on some queries in NTCIR-2 cross 
language experiments to see how Pinyin name 
resolution can affect effectiveness. A second 
experiment is to use BBN?s IdentiFinder as a 
reference, and to compare how our procedures 
succeed in extracting Pinyin names and 
translating them with respect to a reference set. 
4.1 CLIR with Pinyin Names 
One of the NTCIR-2 cross language retrieval 
experiments (Eguchi, et.al. 2001) consists of 50 
English topics and a Chinese target collection of 
about  200  MB.  The  purpose  is  to  retrieve 
relevant Chinese documents using English text 
(topics) as queries. The Chinese counterparts to 
the English topics were also given so that CLIR 
results can be compared to monolingual. The 
original topics are lengthy; we limit our queries 
to a few words from the ?title? section of the 
topics. Three queries have Pinyin names and  
two contain non-person Pinyin entities that 
satisfy our Pinyin name detection format.   
    On running these ?title? queries through our 
procedure, the Pinyin codes were identified, 
candidates suggested, and resolved using the 
target collection. Listed in Table 1 are the 
queries. The Pinyin name in each ?Original 
English? and ?Original Chinese? query is bolded. 
Under   the   column   ?Selected   Names   with  
Occurrence Frequency? are the resolved Pinyin 
names in Chinese, together with their occurrence 
frequencies  in  the  retrieval  collection.  As 
discussed in Section 3, these selections are 
narrowed down from a large number of 
candidates in the intermediate step. 
    The Pinyin in Query 33 is for a kind of bean, 
while Query 44 has the name for a well known 
mountain, but they satisfy our definition of a 
name pattern. It can be seen that except for 
Query 46, the name with the largest occurrence 
agrees with the one intended in the monolingual 
query.  In Query 46, the given name ?Yo-yo? is 
non-standard Pinyin, with suggested candidates 
like ? ? or ? ?, and there are no such 
entries in the collection.  If it were spelt ?You-
you?, the correct characters ???? will be 
among the candidates and selected by the 
collection. When these Pinyin names with 
frequency>=5 were added to our MT software 
concatenated with dictionary translation 
procedure, Kwok (2001), the initial retrieval 
results in Table 2 are obtained.  Here we follow 
the TREC convention to evaluate retrieval using 
the measures RR (relevant documents in top 
1000 retrieved), Av.P (average precision), and 
P@20 (precision at the top 20 documents 
retrieved). 
    Substantial improvements were obtained for 
four of the queries when the names are correctly 
picked, and come closer to or even surpass the 
monolingual result. This demonstrates that our 
approach to Pinyin name resolution can work, 
but we need more queries of this type to confirm 
the effect.  Query #15 has very high Av.P of 
.3287 because dictionary translation brought in 
useful content words not present in the 
monolingual query like:  (kidnapping), 
,  (murder criminal case). These

expand the query and combine synergistically 
with the Pinyin name to provide precision 
surpassing the monolingual result.  As a 
candidate name, ?? in Query #47 has very low 
probability compared to others because the 
character ? (meaning ?mediocre?) is rarely used 
in names. It was pulled out by high occurrence 
frequency in the target collection. Thompson & 
Dozier (1997) have also shown that correctly 
indexing names in monolingual English retrieval 
leads to better retrieval.   
4.2 Resolving Pinyin Names in Text 
   
 In another experiment we intended to test our 
Pinyin procedure with parallel collections that 
contain many paired names, but failed to locate 
one. We intend to evaluate how well our 
extraction procedure works, and whether 
candidate suggestion can recover correct 
Chinese names. A pair of collections was 
downloaded from the Peoples? Daily website 
(2001) Year 2001 English version (~17MB) and 
the Chinese version (~70MB) as our test 
collections. A sampling shows that they have 
very different content. Our aim is to isolate 
Pinyin names from the English collection, and 
create a list of their Chinese counterparts. We 
can then compare our Pinyin extraction against 
the English list. We also like to see how our 
database suggest Chinese candidates for this 
fairly recent name set. The evaluation is more 
approximate compared to doing an evaluation 
using parallel corpora with lots of names paired.  
    BBN?s Identifinder, described in Weischedel 
et. al. (1996) was employed to process both 
collections independently. When given  English 
or Chinese texts, IdentiFinder can bracket 
enttities  of  different  types  such  as:  PERSON, 
LOCATION, ORGANIZATION, etc. for later 
extraction. PERSON entities were isolated and 
two unique person name lists were produced: 
4840 in English and 47621 in Chinese. They 
include Pinyin, non-Chinese and Chinese person 
names. The Chinese list contains many entries 
with one character (such as a surname ), 
translitered foreign names, and some with 
symbols. These we want to avoid.  By capturing 
entries of length >=2 characters, without 
symbols, and having legitimate surnames, a 
filtered list of 23,863 Chinese entries were 
obtained. They were mapped into Pinyin and 
intersected with the English list. A total of 897 
COMMON entries resulted, forming our 
reference set (Fig. 2). These are Chinese names 
obtainable by translating from the 4840-entry 
English list and which occur on the filtered list.  
     The original English collection was next 
processed through our Pinyin identification 
procedure, and 1769 unique entries were 
detected to satisfy our criteria. Comparison with 
IdentiFinder?s English list shows that 1467 
(83%) are the same, and 302 (17%) different. 
The non-overlap can be due to: i) non-person 
entities that sound like names on our list; ii) 
non-Chinese names on the IdentiFinder list; iii) 
legitimate Chinese names detected by one and 
not the other; or iv) errors on either procedures. 
Candidate Chinese names were suggested for 
our 1769-entry Pinyin list, and afterwards 
resolved with the Chinese COMMON list. This 
tests how well our database suggests names for 
Pinyin. The result is shown in Table 3. We show 
suggestions of 1, 5, up to 50 candidates, and 
recall of the reference set improves steadily from 
35.3% to 93.9% (missing 55 of those 897 in 
COMMON) at 50 suggested. This shows the

difficulty of suggesting a correct name: only 
~35% recall at top 1,  ~68% at top 5.  In 
general, small ?top n? is not sufficient to recover 
a correct name translation, while using too many 
lead to noise. Hence there is a need to resolve 
candidates on a relevant collection. 
     We further compare the suggested       
Chinese names for the 1769 Pinyin against the 
filtered Chinese list (23863 entries) to see 
whether our Pinyin extraction can recover 
additional Chinese names not obtained by 
IdentiFinder (from the same English text).  We 
found that at each suggestion level (Tables 4 & 
3), more names were found by our Pinyin 
procedure that were missing in IdentiFinder: 30 
at suggestion level 1, up to 174 (~19%) more 
names at the level of 50.  These 174 are names 
in the filtered portion of the Chinese list but not 
included in COMMON because the English list 
from IdentiFinder does not have their 
corresponding Pinyin. The rest (1769-1016=) 
753 on our list could be non-person entities that 
sounded like names, wrongly identified entries, 
or person names that do not exist in 
IdentiFinder?s Chinese list.  IdentiFinder may 
fail to extract some Chinese names as well.  For 
example, some Pinyin names with ?An? as 
surname were missed.  This study demonstrates

Conclusion and Discussion 
A procedure to translate any Pinyin name into 
possible Chinese characters with probabilities 
based on usage frequencies is proposed.  
Candidates can further be resolved against a text 
collection to narrow down the possibilities. This 
leads to better CLIR results. For a recent English 
news collection, 83% of Pinyin names identified 
agrees with names found by BBN?s 
IdentiFinder. Chinese name candidates for these 
Pinyin cover between 35.3 to 93.9% of a 
COMMON name set for the IdentiFinder names 
when suggestions varies between 1 to 50.  But 
additional Chinese names not extracted by 
IdentiFinder can be located using our procedure. 
Pinyin is an official coding used in China and 
getting popular elsewhere.  Names from other 
places such as Taiwan use different Pinyin 
conventions like Wade-Giles.  We had some 
provision for them, but plan to expand our 
coverage for these names more completely in the 
future.   
    Some web search engines offer advanced 
techniques that allow users to input English key 
terms and display results from Chinese 
documents, selecting items that have the English 
term and Chinese counterpart. These engines 
serve like giant bilingual dictionaries providing 
for entity translation.  However, web pages 
usually contain current data and popular names 
only (like Ma Yo-yo).  Lesser known names 
(like Bai Xiao-yan) are not available.  Our 
approach can suggest Chinese names for Pinyin 
even if web search fails, or the relevant 
collection employed does not further resolve the 
suggested translations. For CLIR, our procedure 
ties translated names to the retrieval collection. 
We envisage each of these approaches has its 
own advantages, and that employing both 
together may help provide more accuracy for the 
issue of how to translate Pinyin names.
