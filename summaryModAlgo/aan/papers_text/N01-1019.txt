Abstract 
This paper describes an approach to Machine 
Translation that places linguistic information 
at its foundation. The difficulty of translation 
from English to Japanese is illustrated with 
data that shows the influence of various 
linguistic contextual factors. Next, a method 
for natural language transfer is presented that 
integrates translation examples (represented 
as typed feature structures with source-target 
indices) with linguistic rules and constraints. 
The method has been implemented, and the 
results of an evaluation are presented. 
Introduction 
High-quality automatic translation requires the 
disambiguation of common, highly ambiguous 
verbs, such as to have, to take, or to get. It also 
requires the correct handling of 
non-compositional, idiomatic expressions with 
varying degrees of ?fixedness?. We view 
Machine Translation in terms of linguistic 
information represented as typed feature 
structures.  By integrating translation information 
represented as example pairs with other types of 
linguistic information represented as rules, our 
approach extends the capabilities of current 
machine translation methods, and solves a 
number of key problems. 
1.  Linguistic Context for Translation 
In translating different words, phrases, and 
expressions, different types and amounts of 
information from the context need to be 
considered. (Only the sentential context is 
considered here.) So far, a systematic solution to 
this problem has not been found. This section 
illustrates the extent of this problem, and the 
remainder of this paper describes our approach.  
1.1. Expressions with to have 
We examined the problem of translating the 
English main verb to have into Japanese.  The 
verb to have was selected because it is quite 
common in colloquial English, yet forms a large 
variety of senses, collocations, and idioms. 615 
different expressions containing the English verb 
to have were extracted from a 7000-sentence 
corpus from the ?international travel? domain.  
Each English expression was manually translated 
into Japanese in the most general way possible. 
1.2. Target-language Distinctions 
The most general translation for the construction 
?X have Y? in this domain was found to be 
 (X-ni Y-ga aru):  
 
The copy shop next door has a fax machine. 
	
 
tonari-no  kopiiya-ni fakkusu-ga arimasu. 
next-ATT copy shop-LOC fax-NOM  exist 
 
Other translations are often necessary when the 
target language imposes finer semantic 
distinction on the state or on the action that is 
described. For example, if the object noun phrase 
refers to one or more human beings, the Japanese 
verb aru is changed into iru.  Similarly, the word 
pet or a pet animal as the object noun phrase 
triggers the translation of to have as katteiru, a 
Japanese verb for keeping an animal as a pet : 
 
We have two sons. 
 
musuko-ga futari  imasu.  
son-NOM two-CONTR exist 
 
Do you have pets? 
 ! 
anata-wa petto-wo katte-imasu-ka 
you-TOP pet-ACC keep-ST-Q 
 
Other examples of finer target-language 
distinctions include a symptom/disease as the 
object of to have.  While many physical 
symptoms and minor diagnoses (e.g. pain, cavity, 
fever, allergy) use the default translation (X-ga 
aru), a serious illness or diagnosis is translated 
into the copula construction. Many other to have 
constructions with a symptom/disease object 
require verbs that are specific to the object noun 
phrase in Japanese: 
 
I have diabetes. 
"#$%& 
watashi-wa toonyobyoo desu. 
I-TOP diabetes  COP 
 
My wife had a stroke last year. 
'()*+,&-./

My husband had a heart attack. 
0123456// 
otto-ga shinzoohossa-wo okoshi-mashita 
husband-NOM heart attack-ACC cause-PST 
 
1.3. Adjuncts in the Source Language 
Some verbal adjuncts can affect the translation of 
the to have construction, not by altering the basic 
sense of ?existing?, but by adding further 
information to specify the way in which 
something ?exists?.  One example of such an 
adjunct is a prepositional phrase (PP) whose 
object noun phrase shares its referent with the 
SUBJ of  have.  For example, the utterance below 
expresses that the map is held or carried by the 
speaker, and the Japanese translation uses the 
verb motte-iru, literally meaning to be 
carrying/holding. 
  
I have the map with me. 
"789:  
watashi-wa sono chizu-wo motte-imasu. 
TOP the map-ACC hold-ST 
 
If the subject noun phrase is inanimate, the 
Japanese translation uses the verb tsuite-iru, 
which literally means to be attached. 
 
The main dish has a salad with it. 
	
 
meindisshu-ni-wa sarada-ga tsuite-imasu. 
main dish-LOC-TOP salad-NOM attach-ST 
 
Similarly, a construction with an on-PP is 
translated into the Japanese construction 
notte-iru, which literally means to be 
written/placed on.  A construction with an in-PP 
is translated into the Japanese construction 
haitte-iru, which literally means to be placed in: 
  
Does the map have subway lines on it. 
789	8;<= ! 
Sono chizu-ni chikatetsusen-ga notte-imasu-ka.

kurozetto-ni yobun-no hangaa-ga  haitte-imasu. 
closet-LOC extra-ATT hanger-NOM placed-in-ST 
 
Adjunct adjectival phrases and past participles 
also specify the way something exists.  For 
example, available in the have construction 
generally changes the translation to aite-iru, to be 
open or available: 
 
We have one twin room available. 
>?@ABCD  
tsuin-no heya-ga  hitotsu aite-imasu 
twin-ATT room-NOM one-CONTR open-ST 
 
1.4. Source Language Ambiguities 
In some cases, the to have construction in English 
carries more than one sense, and some linguistic 
contexts can bring out one of the senses as the 
preferred meaning. For example, the construction 
X has a Y taste is ambiguous between to be 
exercising Y (personal) taste and to taste X.  This 
ambiguity is usually resolved by looking at the 
semantic properties of the subject noun phrase, as 
illustrated in the examples below:  
  
He has simple tastes. 
EF@GHIJ/ K 
kare-ga shinpuru-na shumi-wo shiteiru 
he-NOM simple taste-ACC do-ST 
 
This wine has a very clean taste. 
6L?@ MNO!JK 
kono wain-wa totemo sawayaka-na aji-ga  suru 
this wine-TOP very refreshing taste-NOM do 
 
When the object refers to a specific type of 
information, such as number or address, the 
construction is inherently ambiguous between to 
know (the number), to be carrying (the number), 
and (for the number) to exist. The construction 
usually carries the meaning of to know, but if the 
construction is negated, then the sense of to be 
carrying becomes more preferred, since the 
negative construction is more specific and only 
negates the proposition that the object is 
accessible: 
  
I don?t have his phone number. 
"EPQRS:  
watashi-ga kare-no denwabangoo-wo motteinai 
I-NOM he-GEN phone number-ACC hold-ST-NEG 
 
On the other hand, if the object noun phrase is an 
indefinite noun phrase, it is more likely to mean 
to exist : 
 
 Do you have an extension number? 
 T=RS! 
 naisen bangou-ga  arimasu-ka 
 extension number-NOM exist-Q 
  
Another example of the ambiguities of to have 
concerns the two senses to have something 
available and to eat, when the object noun phrase 
refers to an edible entity.  Our corpus analysis 
shows that some of the linguistic contexts bring 
out one of the two senses as clearly preferred.  
For example, the past tense or the perfective 
aspect brings out the to eat sense, whereas the 
present tense without any aspect markers 
suppresses this sense: 
 
I had raw fish for dinner. 
UVWXY	YZ/

fish-ATT  raw-ACC    dinner-GOAL eat-PST 
 
I don?t have any American beer on tap. 
[\]^_`Hab 
amerika-no  namabiiru-wa  arimasen. 
America-ATT draft beer-TOP exist-NEG 
1.5. Support Verb Constructions and Idioms 
In some of the constructions, to have functions as 
a support verb.  In the support verb construction 
the object noun phrase constitutes a part of the 
verbal predicate rather than an argument of the 
verb.  If the target language does not have an 
equivalent support verb construction, such an 
expression with a support verb construction has 
to be translated into the corresponding single 
verb construction. 
 
Idiomatic expressions in the source and target 
languages, and their varying degrees of 
?fixedness?, also play a role. For example, the 
word (kentoo), the Japanese translation of  
a clue in I don?t have a clue, requires the special 
verb 	
  (tsuku), to constitute an idiomatic 
expression 	
 (kentoo-ga tsuku). As 
another example, the English expression Have a 
good one does not allow a compositional 
translation into a Japanese construction with a 
main verb plus an object. 
1.6. Discussion 
From the data described above, it is clear that 
there are various factors that contribute to the 
different patterns of translation.  In order to 
handle these different translations correctly, it is 
necessary to identify the linguistic features of the 
context that trigger different translations, and to 
determine how the different features and contexts 
interact. In the case of the English to have 
construction, the following surface linguistic 
features are identified that can be interpreted as 
?triggers? for translations other than the default 
translation: 
 
? past tense 
? interrogative or imperative constructions 
? negative  
? modal auxiliaries 
? progressive and/or perfective aspect 
? adjectival modifiers for the object  NP 
(noun phrase) 
? prepositional phrase modifiers for the 
object NP 
? adjectival modifiers for the VP (verb 
phrase) 
? prepositional phrase modifiers for the VP 
? adverbial modifiers for the VP 
? constructions that carry a pragmatic force 
(request, suggestion, etc.) 
 
We found that some of the factors have stronger 
influence on the translation than others. For 
example, consider the following expression: 
 
Can I have a look at the room? 
7Acd.! 
sono heya-wo mi-raremasu-ka. 
the  room-ACC look-PTN-Q 
 
The source-language expression contains more 
than one factor that can trigger a different 
translation.  The first factor is the construction 
that usually carries the pragmatic force of 
?request?, Can I have X?, which usually triggers 
the X  (X-wo o-negai 
dekimasu-ka) construction.  At the same time, the 
object noun phrase a look means that the verb to 
have is used as a support verb. For this reason, the 
combination of the verb have and the object noun 
phrase a look has to be translated into Japanese as 
the verbal predicate  (miru).  This shows that 
the translation preference that is triggered by the 
root string of the object noun phrase is stronger 
and should take preference over the translation 
preference that is triggered by the pragmatic 
force.  
2. Information-based MT 
We argue that the sorts of complex translation 
correspondences that were illustrated in the 
previous section are best represented as 
translation examples, but that the transfer 
procedure must use qualitative linguistic 
constraints in order to choose the correct 
examples.  Given the types of linguistic features 
that influence translation, a highly expressive 
linguistic representation for both input and 
translation examples is required.  We employ 
typed feature structures throughout all stages of 
translation. 
 
Since there are complex interactions among 
different contextual factors, a single quantitative 
matching function that calculates a distance 
between the input and the examples is not 
sufficient.  Multiple steps of matching are needed, 
each considering a small number of linguistic 
dimensions, with the steps executed in the 
appropriate order.  This is best achieved with a 
rule-based linguistic transfer procedure that 
controls the example matching procedure.   
2.1. Transfer Component Architecture 
The transfer component for information-based 
MT consists of two main procedures, the 
linguistic transfer procedure and the example 
matching procedure. This is illustrated in Figure 
1. The input to this component is the 
source-language typed feature structure; this is 
created by an analysis component that is not 
described further here. Similarly, the output of

the transfer component is a target-language typed 
feature structure, from which the  target-language 
expression is generated by the generation 
component (also not described further). 
2.2. Linguistic Transfer  
The linguistic transfer procedure is implemented 
as a rewrite-grammar using the special-purpose 
Grammar Programming Language (GPL)  (Duan, 
et al 2000, Franz, et al 2000a).  The general role 
of the transfer grammar is to operate on the input 
feature structure in a recursive manner, and to 
perform source-to-target transfer by invoking the 
example matching procedure, and by using the 
translation examples to construct a 
target-language feature structure.   The transfer 
grammar implements the principle  of ?large to 
small? in covering the input feature structure.  
 
When the transfer procedure invokes the example 
matching procedure, it implements the principle 
of ?specific to general?.  Since the linguistic 
features interact with each other when they are 
combined, and since some of the features have 
more influence on the translation than others, it is 
necessary to specify a number of separate 
invocations of the example matching procedure, 
and to pay particular attention to their order. The 
invocations of the example matching procedure 
are arranged so that each call focuses on one or 
two features, making sure that both the input and 
the example contain the same feature(s).  
Different invocations of the matching procedure 
are ordered so that the system checks the 
existence of the most important factors first, 
gradually progressing to the least important 
factors. 
2.3. Example Matching  
The example matching procedure matches the 
input feature structure against the example 
feature structures, and it returns the most 
appropriate example. The architecture of this 
module is shown in Figure 2. 
 
When the transfer procedure invokes the example 
matching procedure, it specifies a set of linguistic 
constraints on which examples may be 
considered. This is used to narrow down the 
search space from all the examples to a much 
smaller set. The examples that satisfy these 
constraints are matched in detail against the input 
feature structure. The detailed match is a 
recursive process operating on the two feature 
structures that is based on costs for inserting, 
deleting, or altering features, and on certain 
constraints for particular features. Lexical 
similarity is calculated from the thesaurus on the 
basis of the information content of the thesaurus 
nodes. 
 
During example matching, the input feature 
structure is aligned with the example feature 
structure.  The alignment information is used by 
the transfer procedure to handle differences 
between the input and the example. For example, 
if the input contains grammatical features, 
modifiers, adjuncts, or sub-constituents that are 
not in the examples, then they are transferred to 
the target-language representation. Similarly, if 
the example feature structure contains 
information that is not present in the input, then 
the transfer procedure deletes the relevant 
information. 
3. Example Database  
The example database contains a large set of 
translation examples represented as pairs of 
typed feature structures in the source and target 
languages. Using a Treebanking tool, the 
examples are disambiguated, and indices that 
show corresponding constituents are added. In 
addition to the type and complexity of the 
example feature structures, there are three 
methods for identifying the degree of linguistic

specificity of an example: marked examples, 
example indices, and semantic constraints. This 
information is used by the transfer procedure and 
the matching procedure to select the best example, 
using the mechanism of linguistic matching 
constraints that was described above. 
3.1. Marked Examples  
Some of the features that were shown in Section 2 
to influence the translation have been 
traditionally described as ?marked?. Examples 
include negation, interrogative, and also the 
presence of certain adjuncts. The transfer 
procedure regards these examples as more 
specific than unmarked examples, and (via the 
linguistic constraints passed to the matching 
procedure) only allows such examples when 
appropriate. 
3.2. Example Indices  
Examples can contain two types of indices 
linking a source-language sub-feature-structure 
with a target-language sub-feature-structure. A 
CORRESPOND-INDEX signals that the two 
constituents correspond to each other, while a 
REPLACE-INDEX signals that two constituents 
correspond to each other and can be replaced by 
similar constituents.  
 
The absence of such indices in a major argument 
phrase (such as the subject or object) indicates 
that the example is more specific. A 
CORRESPOND-INDEX is more specific than a 
REPLACE-INDEX, since a CORRESPOND- 
INDEX indicates that although the head of the 
constituent allows modifiers, the constituent can 
not be substituted. For example, the object the 
bucket in the example for the idiom to kick the 
bucket does not contain any indices, since the 
idiom does not allow substitution or modification. 
On the other hand, a heart attack in to have a 
heart attack allows modifiers (e.g. a severe heart 
attack), so the example for the idiomatic 
translation carries a CORRESPOND-INDEX. 
3.3. Semantic Constraints  
The example database also contains certain 
semantic constraints on source-language 
sub-feature-structures. When an input feature 
structure is matched with such an example, the 
matching procedure checks whether the input 
satisfies the semantic constraint. If it does, then 
that example is preferred over other examples, 
since it is more specific than other examples that 
do not carry a semantic constraint. On the other 
hand, if the input does not match the constraint, 
then the match is rejected.  
3.4. Sample Entry 
Figure 3 shows the example pair for the 
expressions Can I have your name? 
	
  (o-namae-wo o-negai 
dekimasu-ka). This example has a number of 
marked features. The mood of the sentence is 
yes-no question, the modal auxiliary can is 
present, and the subject does not contain an index. 
These features are used by the transfer procedure 
to ensure that the example is only used to 
translate appropriate input.  
 
4. Implementation and Evaluation  
A prototype implementation of this translation 
method has been created by the Sony USRL 
Speech Translation group (Franz et al 200b). The 
prototype was developed for the ?overseas travel 
domain?, which includes utterances and 
expressions useful for travel between e.g. Japan 
and the USA.  
4.1. Lexicon and Example Database  
The English-to-Japanese translation system 
includes an English dictionary with 6483 unique 
English root forms, and the English-to-Japanese 
example database contains 14,281 separate 
example pairs.  These entries consist of 
constructions of various sizes, ranging from

Figure 3: Excerpt from the example database entry for  
Can I have your name? 
 
conjoined sentences to individual words. For 
some example pairs, the system automatically  
extracts corresponding parts from the source and 
target expressions, and creates a new example 
pair. As a result, the system has a total of 24,072 
example database entries available. 
4.2. Development Set 
We developed, tested, and refined the system 
until all of the main predicates of the 615 
development set sentences with to have were 
translated correctly. For this, the system used 129 
distinct example pairs with the main verb to have.  
Many example pairs encode a specific 
translation: 68 out of the 129 entries were used to 
translate only one expression from the 
development set.  On the other hand, some entries 
are very general, and are used to translate a large 
number of expressions.  The most frequently 
used entry is Do you have sushi?  
 (sushi-ga arimasu-ka), which is used 
to translate 113 out of the 615 development set 
expressions.    
4.3. Linguistic Transfer  
The transfer grammar contains 153 context-free 
rules.  Each rule includes a rule-body with GPL 
statements, which can include calls to the 
example matching procedure, and calls to 
sub-transfer rules. To translate the 615 
expression in the to have development set, the 
system performed an average of 3.4 
match-and-transfer steps.  (In many cases, more 
than one transfer path was pursued.)  Only 26 out 
of the 615 expressions were translated with only 
one match-and-transfer step.  Examples of such 
expressions include Have a good one! and You 
can have it. At the other extreme, the maximum 
number of match-and-transfer steps required to 
translate a single input expression was 9.  One of 
the expressions that required 9 
match-and-transfer steps was The double on the 
third floor has a really nice view of the ocean.   
4.4. Evaluation 
The system was evaluated using a new corpus of 
unseen expressions with the verb to have. The 
evaluation data was collected from three different 
travel phrase books published by Barron, Berlitz, 
and Lonely Planet. The English expressions 
containing to have as a regular verb (and have got 
as a main predicate) were manually extracted 
from the phrase books.  There were 405 unique 
expressions with have in the resulting evaluation 
corpus, with an average of 5.5 words. The 
evaluation corpus was translated by the 
translation system, and each of the output 
expressions was examined and manually 
categorized according to its translation quality. 
The result is shown in the table below: 
. 
Flawless Translations 351 86.7% 
Incomplete Translations 
due to OOV 48 11.8% 
Wrong Translations 6 1.5% 
Total 405 100% 
The category ?flawless translation? refers to 
translations without any obvious flaws or 
problems.  ?Incomplete translations due to OOV? 
refers to translations where the main predicate 
was correctly translated, but due to some 
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) nouns or modifiers, 
parts of the source-language input words were 
carried through to the target language expression.  
The category ?wrong translation? refers to 
translations where the main predicate is 
incorrectly translated, with or without 
out-of-vocabulary words.   
4.5. Discussion 
Some of the wrong translations are due to 
ambiguities in the object noun phrase, such as a 
fall in My child has had a fall, which the system 
translated as watashi-no kodomo-wa aki-ga 
arimashita (meaning My child had an autum).  
There were also a number of expressions that 
should have been translated into different 
predicates in Japanese, but which were not 
covered in the example database.  Examples of 
these include the following : 
 
Input:    I?ve got a nosebleed. 
Output: ef 
g g g    hanaji-ga ari-masu 
               nosebleed-NOM exist 
Appropriate Translation: 
efh  
        hanaji-ga dete-imasu 
             nosebleed-NOM come out-ST 
 
The evaluation shows that the information-based 
translation method works reliably for translating 
short, single-clause utterances.  In support of the 
generality of this method, we found that 
translation accuracy could be improved by 
adding more examples, and that the features that 
mark specificity of example entries are 
applicable to expressions with other common 
verbs besides have.  
4.6. Future Work 
One difficult problem remains in the treatment of 
support verb constructions.  When the object has 
a modifier, the modifier has to be transferred as a 
verbal modifier in the target language if the target 
language requires a single verb construction.  For 
example, to have a close look is translated as to 
look closely, and to have another look is 
translated as to look again.  There are, however, 
not enough data in the development set to draw 
any conclusions about how general these 
modifiers can be treated across different support 
verb constructions. 
 
One hypothesis is that there are different degrees 
of proximity between the support verb and the 
object noun phrase.  In some cases, there might 
be only one fixed phrase to be interpreted as the 
support verb construction, while other cases may 
allow many different modifiers for the object 
noun phrase.  This is suggested by the case of to 
have a seat in the development set. This phrase 
allows the interpretation of to sit only if the 
object noun phrase is exactly a seat.  The 
expression to have another seat cannot be 
translated as to sit again, but more like for 
another seat to exist.  Further analysis of support 
verb construction data, including instances with 
other verbs besides have, will be necessary to 
determine how these constructions can best be 
handled in the current framework.  
 
Another avenue for future work is the use of 
Machine Learning techniques to select linguistic 
features, and statistical methods (such as 
loglinear models) to model the effect of feature 
combinations.  
Conclusion 
The approach described in this paper is based on 
the conviction that natural language transfer must 
be driven by qualitative, linguistic information.  
The analysis of the problem of translating one 
construction from English to Japanese has shown 
that a significant amount of linguistic 
information is necessary for achieving 
high-quality translation of something as simple 
as single-clause input.  The transfer method that 
this paper described as one possible solution can 
integrate translation examples with linguistic 
rules and constraints in an effective manner. 
 
The linguistic information used in this approach 
is general and domain-independent; 
domain-specific translation knowledge is 
confined to the example database.  This modular 
system architecture presents significant 
advantages for developing, maintaining, and 
extending a practical machine translation system.
