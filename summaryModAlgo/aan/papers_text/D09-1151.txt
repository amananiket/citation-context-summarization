Abstract
This paper proposes a probabilistic model
for associative anaphora resolution in
Japanese. Associative anaphora is a
type of bridging anaphora, in which the
anaphor and its antecedent are not coref-
erent. Our model regards associative
anaphora as a kind of zero anaphora and
resolves it in the same manner as zero
anaphora resolution using automatically
acquired lexical knowledge. Experimen-
tal results show that our model resolves
associative anaphora with good perfor-
mance and the performance is improved
by resolving it simultaneously with zero
anaphora.
1 Introduction
The correct interpretation of anaphora is vital
for natural language understanding. Bridging
anaphora (Clark, 1975) represents a special part of
the general problem of anaphora resolution, which
has been studied and discussed for various lan-
guages and domains (Hahn et al, 1996; Murata et
al., 1999; Poesio et al, 2004; Gasperin and Vieira,
2004; Gasperin and Briscoe, 2008).
Usually bridging anaphora considers two
types:
1
associative anaphors are noun phrases
(NPs) that have an antecedent that is necessary
to their interpretation but the relation between the
anaphor and its antecedent is different from iden-
tity; and indirect anaphors are those that have
an identity relation with their antecedents but the
anaphor and its antecedent have different head
1
The terminology that we use here is introduced by
Hawkins (1978), which is also used in (Vieira et al, 2006).
nouns. In this paper, we focus on associative
anaphora in Japanese.
Associative anaphora resolution is decomposed
into two steps: acquiring lexical knowledge for as-
sociative anaphora resolution, and resolving asso-
ciative anaphora using the acquired knowledge.
Grammatical salience plays a lesser role for
resolving anaphors with full lexical heads, than
for pronominal anaphora (Strube and Hahn, 1999;
Modjeska, 2002). Furthermore, since associative
anaphors and their antecedents usually have differ-
ent head nouns, string matching technique cannot
be applied. Therefore, a large and diverse amount
of lexical knowledge is essential to understand as-
sociative anaphora. For example, to recognize the
meronymic relation between ?a house? and ?the
roof? in (1), such knowledge as ?a roof? is a part
of a building or vehicle is required. To recognize
the attributive relation between ?Prius? and ?the
price? in (2), such knowledge as ?price? is a price
of some goods or service is required.
(1) There was a house. The roof was white.
(2) Toyota launched the hybrid car Prius in
1997. The price was 21.5 million yen.
To acquire such lexical knowledge, various
studies have been carried out. Early studies used
hand-crafted lexical knowledge such as Word-
Net (Strube and Hahn, 1999; Vieira and Poe-
sio, 2000; Meyer and Dale, 2002), but obtained
poor or mediocre results. Hence, Poesio et al
(2002) proposed to exploit ?N
h
of N
m
? phrases
in large corpora to resolve associative anaphora
in English; Murata et al (1999) proposed to ex-
ploit ?N
m
no N
h
? phrases to resolve associative
anaphora in Japanese. Here, the Japanese postpo-
sition ?no? roughly corresponds to ?of,? but it has
1455
much broader usage. These studies obtained rea-
sonable results, but the coverage of the acquired
knowledge was not sufficient. Recently, a num-
ber of researchers argued for using the Web as a
source of lexical knowledge, and theWeb has been
shown to be a useful resource for anaphora resolu-
tion (Bunescu, 2003; Markert et al, 2003; Poesio
et al, 2004).
Hence, in this study, we acquire the lexi-
cal knowledge for associative anaphora resolution
from ?N
m
noN
h
? phrases in the Web by using the
method described in (Sasano et al, 2004). We pro-
posed a method for acquiring such lexical knowl-
edge, called nominal case frames (NCFs), using
an ordinary language dictionary and ?N
m
no N
h
?
phrases, and constructed NCFs from newspaper
corpora. In this study, we aim to acquire a suffi-
cient amount of lexical knowledge by constructing
NCFs from the Web.
As for associative anaphora resolution itself, we
propose an integrated probabilistic model for zero
anaphora and associative anaphora resolution, in
which associative anaphora is regarded as a kind
of zero anaphora and resolved by using the same
model as zero anaphora. Our model assumes zero
pronouns that represent indispensable entities of
target noun phrases, which are called zero adnom-
inal in (Yamura-Takei, 2003), and conducts zero
pronoun resolution.
Let us consider the associative anaphoric re-
lation between ?Prius? and ?kakaku? (price).
Although ?kakaku? itself is considered as the
anaphor from a conventional point of view (3a),
our model assumes a zero pronoun ? and consid-
ers it as the anaphor (3b).
(3) a. Prius - kakaku (price)
[antecedent: Prius, anaphor: kakaku (price)]
b. Prius - (?-no) kakaku (price (of ?))
[antecedent: Prius, anaphor: ?]
The point of this study is three-fold: the ac-
quisition of the lexical knowledge for associative
anaphora resolution from the Web, the application
of zero anaphora resolution model to associative
anaphora resolution, and the integrated resolution
of zero anaphora and associative anaphora.
2 Construction of Nominal Case Frames
Most nouns have their indispensable entities:
?price? is a price of some goods or service, ?roof?
is a roof of some building, and ?coach? is a coach
of some sports. The relation between a noun and
its indispensable entities is parallel to that between
a verb and its arguments or obligatory cases. In
this paper, we call indispensable entities of nouns
obligatory cases. Note that, obligatory does not
mean grammatically obligatory but obligatory to
interpret the meaning of the noun. Associative
anaphora resolution needs comprehensive infor-
mation of obligatory cases of nouns. Nominal case
frames (NCFs) describe such information, and we
construct them from the Web.
2.1 Automatic Construction of NCFs
First, we briefly introduce our method for con-
structing NCFs from raw corpora proposed in
(Sasano et al, 2004).
Whereas verbal case frame construction uses ar-
guments of each verb (Kawahara and Kurohashi,
2002), nominal case frame construction basically
uses adnominal constituents of each noun. How-
ever, while the meaning of a verbal argument can
be distinguished by the postposition, such as ?ga?
(nominative), ?wo? (accusative), and ?ni? (dative),
the meaning of an adnominal constituent can not
be distinguished easily, because most adnominal
constituents appear with the same postposition
?no? (of). Thus, we first conduct a semantic anal-
ysis of adnominal constituents, and then construct
NCFs using the results as follows:
1. Collect syntactically unambiguous noun
phrases ?N
m
no N
h
? from the automatic re-
sulting parses of large corpora.
2. Analyze the relation between N
m
and N
h
by Kurohashi and Sakai?s method (1999) that
exploits an ordinary language dictionary.
3. Depending on the results, classify N
m
, and
obtain preliminary case slots for N
h
.
4. Merge case slots if two preliminary case slots
of N
h
are similar.
5. Consider frequent case slots as obligatory
cases of N
h
. The frequency thresholds are
varied according to semantic analyses.
6. For each meaning of N
h
, collect case slots
and construct case frames.
The point of this method is the integrated use of
an ordinary dictionary and example phrases from
1456

large corpora. Dictionary definition sentences are
an informative resource to recognize obligatory
cases of nouns. However, it is difficult to resolve
associative anaphora by using a dictionary as it is,
because all nouns in a definition sentence are not
an obligatory case, and only the frequency infor-
mation of noun phrases tells us which is the oblig-
atory case. On the other hand, a simple method
that just collects and clusters ?N
m
no N
h
? phrases
based on some similarity measure of nouns cannot
construct comprehensive nominal case frames, be-
cause of polysemy and multiple obligatory cases.
For details see (Sasano et al, 2004).
It is desirable to use a probability distribution
for deciding whether a case slot is obligatory or
not. However, it is difficult to estimate a prob-
ability distribution, since we construct nominal
case frames not by using the examples of associa-
tive anaphora itself but by using the examples of
noun phrases ?N
m
no N
h
? (N
h
of N
m
). We use
such noun phrases because indispensable entities
of noun ?N
h
? often appear as ?N
m
.? However, we
can say neither frequently appeared ?N
m
? is an in-
dispensable entity of ?N
h
.? nor an indispensable
entity frequently appears as ?N
m
.? For example,
the name of a country is considered as an indis-
pensable entity of ?shusho? (prime minister), but
does not frequently appear as ?N
m
.?
2
Thus, it is
difficult to estimate a probability distribution and
we use a hard decision.
2.2 NCF Construction from the Web
We constructed nominal case frames from theWeb
Corpus (Kawahara and Kurohashi, 2006), which
comprises 1.6 billion unique Japanese sentences.
In this corpus, there were about 390 million noun
phrases ?N
m
no N
h
,? about 100 million unique
noun phrases, and about 17 million unique head
nouns ?N
h
.? There were about 4.07 million head
nouns that appeared more than 10 times in the cor-
pus, and we used only such head nouns.
The resultant nominal case frames consisted of
about 564,000 nouns including compound nouns.
We show examples of constructed nominal case
frames in Table 1. The average number of case
frames for a noun that has case frames was 1.0031,
and the average number of case slots for a case
frame was 1.0101. However, these statistics dif-
fered with the frequency of the noun. Therefore,
we investigated the statistics of constructed nom-
inal case frames for each group classified by the
frequency of the nouns. Table 2 shows the re-

tioned by simply ?the prime minister? in Japanese.

sult. As for the 10,000 most frequently appeared
nouns, which occupied about 70% of all noun ap-
pearances, the average number of case frames for
a noun was 1.11, and the average number of case
slots for a case frame was 1.17.
For evaluating the resultant case frames, we ran-
domly selected 100 nouns from the 10,000 most
frequent nouns, and created gold standard case
frames for these nouns by hand. For each noun,
case frames were given if the noun was considered
to have any indispensable entity, and for each case
frame, obligatory case slots were given manually:
70 case frames were created that had 84 case slots;
56 case frames had only one case slot, the other 14
case frames had two case slots. 30 nouns had no
case frames.
We then evaluated the automatically con-
structed case slots for these selected nouns. The
evaluation result is shown in Table 3: the sys-
tem output 70 case slots, and out of them, 62 case
frames were judged as correct. The F-measure was
0.81. Since the boundary between indispensable
cases and optional cases of a noun is not always
obvious, this score is considered to be reasonable.
2.3 Generalization of Examples
By using nominal case frames constructed from
the Web, sparseness problem was alleviated to
some extent, but still remained. For instance, there
were thousands of named entities (NEs), which
could not be covered intrinsically. To deal with
this sparseness problem, we generalized the exam-
ples of case slots.
First, we used the categories that Japanese mor-
phological analyzer JUMAN
3
adds to common
nouns. In JUMAN, about twenty categories are
defined and tagged to common nouns. For ex-
ample, ?kuruma (car),? ?niwatori (chicken),? and
?tatemono (building)? are tagged as ?VEHICLE,?
?ANIMAL? and ?FACILITY,? respectively. For
each category, we calculated the rate of catego-
rized examples among all case slot examples, and
added it to the case slot as ?[CT:VEHICLE]:0.13.?
We also generalized NEs. We used a com-
mon standard NE definition for Japanese pro-
vided by IREX workshop (1999). We first rec-
ognized NEs in the source corpus by using an
NE recognizer (Sasano and Kurohashi, 2008), and
then constructed NCFs from the NE-recognized
corpus. As well as categories, for each NE
class, we calculated the NE rate among all case
slot examples, and added it to the case slot as
?[NE:PERSON]:0.22.? The generalized examples
are also included in Table 1.
3 Probabilistic Model
In this study, we apply a lexicalized probabilis-
tic model for zero anaphora resolution proposed in
(Sasano et al, 2008) to associative anaphora reso-
lution.
3.1 A Lexicalized Probabilistic Model for
Zero Anaphora Resolution
In English, overt pronouns such as ?she? and
definite noun phrases such as ?the company?
are anaphors that refer to preceding entities (an-
tecedents). On the other hand, in Japanese,
anaphors are often omitted, which are called zero
pronouns, and zero anaphora resolution is one of
the most important techniques for semantic analy-
sis in Japanese.
Here, we introduce our model for zero anaphora
resolution (Sasano et al, 2008). This model first
resolves coreference and identifies discourse enti-
ties; then from the end of each sentence, analyzes
each predicate by the following steps:
1. Select a case frame temporarily.
2. Consider all possible correspondences be-
tween each input argument and a case slot of
the selected case frame.
3. Regard case slots that have no correspon-
dence as zero pronoun candidates.

1458
4. Consider all possible correspondences be-
tween zero pronoun candidates and existing
entities.
5. For each possible case frame, estimate each
correspondence probabilistically, and select
the most likely case frame and correspon-
dence.
Figure 1 shows an example of correspondences
between case frames and discourse entities.
The probabilistic model gives a probability to
each possible case frame CF and case assignment
CA when target predicate v, input arguments IA
and existing discourse entities ENT are given,
and outputs the case frame and case assignment
that have the highest probability. That is to say,
their model selects the case frame CF

and the
case assignment CA

that maximize the proba-
bility P (CF,CA|v, IA,ENT ):

By decomposing case assignment (CA) into
direct case assignment (DCA) and the indirect
case assignment (ICA) and using several inde-
pendence assumptions, Equation (i) is transformed
into the following equation:

ments when a case frame is given, and estimated
by using case structure analysis of large raw cor-

direct case assignments are given, and estimated
by using several preferences on the relation
between a zero pronoun and an antecedent, such
as a lexical preference, a surface case preferences,
and a locational preference.
For example, the lexical preference represents
how likely an entity that contains n

tent part is considered to be an antecedent and is
estimated by the following equation.

of a zero pro-
noun, when a case frame and a case slot are given
and the case slot is filled with an antecedent of a
zero pronoun.
3.2 Extension to Associative Anaphora
Resolution
We then extend this probabilistic model to associa-
tive anaphora resolution. In this model, associative
anaphora is regarded as a kind of zero anaphora,
that is, the relation between a noun and its oblig-
atory cases is considered to be parallel to that be-
tween a verb and its arguments. Omitted obliga-
tory cases are considered to be zero pronouns and
resolved by the same process as zero anaphora res-
olution.
We conduct associative anaphora resolution for
only non-coreferent noun phrases. This is because
most of the relationships between coreferent noun

phrases and its obligatory entities are easy to rec-
ognize by following up the coreference chains.
For example, the second appearance of ?the roof?
in (4) means ?the roof of the house,? and it is
easy to recognize by looking the first appearance
of ?the roof.?
(4) I saw the roof of the house. The roof was
painted dark green.
While verbal case frames describe both obliga-
tory and optional cases, nominal case frames de-
scribe only obligatory cases. Therefore, we con-
sider all case slots of nominal case frames as the
target of associative anaphora resolution.
Let us consider following example:

overseas in 2000. The initial price
of ?
2
was 21.5 million yen.)
?Kakaku? (price) in this example has an omitted
obligatory case ?[something]? as shown in Table
1. Therefore, our model assumes a zero pronoun
and identifies the antecedent from the existing dis-
course entities, such as {Toyota}, {hybrid-car,
Prius},
5
and {kaigai}. Figure 2 shows an exam-
ple of correspondences between the nominal case
frame of ?kakaku? (price) and discourse entities.
In addition, as well as zero anaphora resolution,
we exploit generalized examples to estimate lexi-
cal preference. When one mention of an entity is
5
?Hybrid car? and ?Prius? are in apposition and these two
phrases are considered to refer to the same discourse entity.
tagged any category or recognized as an NE, our
model also uses the category or the NE class as the
content part of the entity. Specifically, for estimat-
ing Equation (iii), our model also calculates:
P (NE :ARTIFACT |kakaku(1), no, A
?
(no)=1)
P (NE :ARTIFACT )
besides:
P (Prius|kakaku(1), no, A
?
(no) = 1)
P (Prius)
and uses the geometric mean of them.
3.3 Salience Score Filtering
Previous work has reported the usefulness of
salience for anaphora resolution (Lappin and Le-
ass, 1994; Mitkov et al, 2002). In order to con-
sider the salience of a discourse entity, we intro-
duce the concept of salience score, which is calcu-
lated by the following set of simple rules, and only
consider the entities that have the salience score no
less than 1 as candidate antecedents of an associa-
tive anaphor.
? +2 : mentioned with topical marker ?wa,? or
at the end of a sentence.
? +1 : mentioned without topical marker ?wa.?
? +1 : assigned to a zero pronoun.
? ?? : beginning of each sentence.
We call ? a decay rate. If ? ? 1, we do not
filter out any entities. If ? = 0, we only consider
the entities that appears in the same sentence as
candidate antecedents. For example, we consider
the salience score of the discourse entity {hybrid-
car, Prius} in the example (5) when using ?=0.6.
In the first sentence, since {hybrid-car, Prius} is
mentioned twice, the salience score is 2.0. At the
beginning of the second sentence it becomes 1.2,
and after the zero anaphora resolution of ?hanbai?
it becomes 2.2. At the beginning of the third sen-
tence it becomes 1.32.
Note that, this is an ideal case. Practically, some
zero pronouns are not detected and some pronouns
are assigned wrong antecedent; thus the salience
score varies according to the preceding analysis.
In addition, the salience score also depends on
whether we resolve only associative anaphora or
resolve associative anaphora simultaneously with
zero anaphora. If zero pronoun resolution is not
1460
conducted, zero pronouns that represent omitted
cases of verbs are not considered.
For example, in case of {hybrid-car, Prius}
with ? = 0.6, if zero anaphora resolution is not
conducted, the salience score at the beginning of
the third sentence becomes 0.72, because the zero
anaphora resolution of ?hanbai? is not considered;
and thus {hybrid-car, Prius} is not considered as
an antecedent candidate.
In order to recognize discourse structure more
properly, our model basically resolves associa-
tive anaphora simultaneously with zero anaphora,
and aims to consider zero pronouns that represent
omitted cases of verbs.
3.4 Summary of Our model
Our model is summarized as follows:
1. Parse an input text using the Japanese parser
KNP
6
and recognize NEs.
2. Resolve coreference, and link each mention
to an entity or create a new entity.
3. From the end of each sentence, zero anaphora
and associative anaphora resolution is con-
ducted for each verb and non-coreferent noun
by the following steps:
(a) Select a case frame temporarily.
(b) Consider all possible correspondences
between each input argument and a case
slot of the selected case frame.
(c) Regard case slots that have no corre-
spondence as zero pronoun candidates.
(d) Consider all possible correspondences
between zero pronoun candidates and
existing entities that has a salience score
no less than 1.0.
(e) Estimate each correspondence proba-
bilistically, and select the most likely
case frame and a correspondence.
4 Experiments
4.1 Setting
We created an anaphoric relation-tagged corpus
consisting of 186 web documents (979 sentences),
in which all predicate-argument relations and re-
lations between nouns were manually tagged. We
show some examples:

2
overseas in 2000.)
TAG: hatsubai ? ga:Toyota, wo:Prius,
(NOM) (ACC)
hanbai ? ga:Toyota, wo:Prius
(NOM) (ACC)
For the predicate ?hatsubai? (launch), ?Toyota?
is tagged as ga (nominative) case and ?Prius? is
tagged as wo (accusative) case. For the predicate
?hanbai? (sell), ?Toyota? is tagged as omitted ga
(nominative) case and ?Prius? is tagged as omit-
ted wo (accusative) case, which are indicated in
bold, and such omitted cases are the target of zero
anaphora resolution.
As for relations between nouns, both overt and
implicit relations are tagged with the Japanese
case marker ?no? (adnominal). In addition, rela-
tions between nouns are classified into three cate-
gories: indispensable, possible, and adjunct. Since
it is not always obvious whether the relations are
indispensable or not, borderline relations between
indispensable and adjunct are tagged possible. We
consider only the implicit relations that are tagged
indispensable as the target of associative anaphora
resolution.

We used 62 documents for testing and used the
other 124 documents for calculating several prob-
abilities. In the 62 test documents, 110 associa-
tive anaphoric relations were tagged. Each param-
eter for the proposed model was estimated using
maximum likelihood from raw corpora, the tagged
corpus, and case frames. As verbal case frames,
we used the case frames constructed from the Web
corpus comprising 1.6 billion sentences (Sasano et
al., 2009).
In order to concentrate on associative anaphora
resolution, we used the correct morphemes, named
entities, syntactic structures, and coreference re-

rect coreference relations were given, the number
of created entities was the same between the gold
standard data and the system output because zero
anaphora and associative anaphora resolution did
not create new entities.
4.2 Results
Figure 3 shows the experimental results of asso-
ciative anaphora resolution, in which we used gen-
eralized examples, resolved zero anaphora auto-
matically, and varied the decay rate ? introduced
in Section 3.3 from 0 to 1. When we used the de-
cay rates smaller than 0.5, the recall score wors-
ened clearly. On the other hand, although we ex-
pected to obtain higher precision with small decay
rate, the highest precision was achieved by the de-
cay rate 0.5. Consequently, we obtained the high-
est F-measure of 0.427 with the decay rate 0.5. In
the following experiments, we fixed the decay rate
0.5.
We utilized two baseline models for demon-
strating the effectiveness of our approach: a ran-
dom model and a salience-based model. The ran-
dom model selects a case frame and its correspon-
dence randomly from all possible case frames and
correspondences. The salience-based model se-
lects a case frame and its correspondence that as-
sign a zero pronoun candidate the existing entity
that have highest salience score. In addition, in or-
der to confirm the effectiveness of generalized ex-
amples of NCFs, we conducted experiments with-
out using generalized examples. Table 4 shows
the experimental results. We can confirm that our
proposed model outperforms two baseline mod-
els. Without using any generalized examples, the

* The average of 10 trials is shown.
F-measure was about 0.14 lower than the method
using generalized examples, and we can also con-
firm the effectiveness of the generalized examples.
While generalization of categories much improved
the F-measure, generalization of NEs contributed
little. This is because the NE rate was smaller than
the common noun rate, and so the effect was lim-
ited. This tendency was also seen in zero anaphora
resolution (Sasano et al, 2008).
In order to investigate the effects of zero
anaphora resolution, we tested our model under
three conditions: without zero anaphora resolu-
tion (no resolution), with zero anaphora resolution
(automatically resolved), and with using correct
zero anaphora relations that are manually tagged
(manually identified). The performance of auto-
matic zero anaphora resolution resulted in a recall
of 0.353, a precision of 0.375, and an F-measure of
0.364. Table 5 shows the experimental results. To
resolve associative anaphora simultaneously with
zero anaphora improved F-measure by 0.072; us-
ing correct zero anaphora relations improved F-
measure by 0.103. We can confirm that the per-
formance of associative anaphora resolution is im-
proved by considering zero anaphora.
Note that, strictly speaking, these comparisons
are not fair because we set the decay rate ? to max-
imize the performance when using generalized ex-
amples and resolving zero anaphora automatically.
However, these tendencies described above were
also seen with other decay rates.

4.3 Discussion
By using generalized examples and resolving
simultaneously with zero anaphora, our model
achieved a recall of 0.518 (57/110), but there were
still 53 associative anaphoric relations that were
not recognized. Table 6 shows the causes of them.
22 false negatives were caused by salience score
filtering. Note that, it does not mean that these 22
associative anaphoric relations were always recog-
nized correctly if the correct antecedents were not
filtered by salience score.
Case frame sparseness caused only 5 false neg-
atives. Considering that the recall of nominal case
frames was 74% as shown in Table 3, this seems to
be too few. This is because we do not considered
the relations that tagged possible, and only con-
sidered obviously indispensable relations. From
this result, we can say that coverage of nominal
case frames for nouns that have obviously indis-
pensable entities is much higher than 74%, which
is considered to achieve a coverage of about 95%
(105/110).
4.4 Comparison with previous work
Murata et al (1999) proposed a method of utiliz-
ing ?N
m
no N
h
? phrases for associative anaphora
resolution.
7
They basically used all ?N
m
no N
h
?
phrases from corpora as a lexical knowledge, and
used rule-based approach. They obtained a recall
of 0.63 and a precision of 0.68 by using exam-
ples of ?X no Y? (Y of X), a recall of 0.71 and a
precision of 0.82 by assuming ideal nominal case
frames. One reason of such high performance may
be that they considered referential properties of
noun phrases, such as generic, indefinite, and defi-
nite, while our model does not. We can also say
that their experiments were conducted on small
and supposedly easy corpora. Half of their corpora

Murata et al (1999) and we (Sasano et al, 2004) used
the terminology indirect anaphora, but concerned with the
same phenomena as we concerned with in this paper.

were occupied by fairy tale, against which domain
specific rules are considered to be effective.
We proposed a rule-based approach for asso-
ciative anaphora resolution based on automati-
cally acquired nominal case frames (Sasano et al,
2004).
7
We obtained a recall of 0.633 and a pre-
cision of 0.508 against news paper articles. How-
ever, we regarded some additional relations that
can be interpreted by considering coreference re-
lations as associative anaphoric relations.
(9) Chechen Ky?owakoku-no shuto-ni ...
Chechen Republic capital
... shuto seiatsu-no saishu dankai-ni ...
capital conquer last stage
(... to the capital of Chechen Republic ... in the last
stage to conquer the capital ...)
For example, although the second mention of
?shuto? (capital) in example (9) means ?Chechen
Ky?owakoku-no shuto? (the capital of Chechen Re-
public), it can be interpreted by recognizing the
coreference relation between the first and second
mentions of ?shuto? (capital). Therefore, as men-
tioned in Section 3.2, we do not consider such re-
lations as associative anaphora in this study; we
included such relations as associative anaphora in
(Sasano et al, 2004). The relatively high score is
caused by this criterion.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed a probabilistic model
for associative anaphora resolution. Our model
regards associative anaphora as a kind of zero
anaphora and resolves it in the same manner as
zero anaphora resolution that uses automatically
acquired case frames. We also showed that the
performance of associative anaphora resolution
can be improved by resolving it simultaneously
with zero anaphora. As future work, we plan to
consider referential properties of noun phrases in
associative anaphora resolution.
