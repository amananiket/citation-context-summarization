ABSTRACT 
This paper describes a field grammar for 
Danish and its implementations in a Prolog 
version with predeclared types. In compa- 
r ison to the ususa l  S -> NP VP schema, 
this kind of grammar, where the first rule 
is S -> CNF FF NF CF enhances  ana lys i s  
effeciency because the f ields specify 
constituents and syntactic function at the 
same time. The field grammar tradition is 
outl inedand an overv iew of the major rules 
of the Prolog program, which implements 
the grammar, is given. 
FIELD GRAMMAR 
A Syntactic Strategy 
In terms of computational l inguistics, 
field grammar may be viewed as a syntactic 
strategy, which offers the user the imme- 
diate constituents whi le at the same time 
giving their syntactic functions and the 
functional sentence perspective, in part 
at least. Field grammar furthermore faci- 
l itates the handl ing of discontinuous con- 
stituents, as wil l  be shown. 
Background 
The field grammar of the Danish linguist 
Paul Diderichsen adequately describes con- 
stituent structure in Danish, while at the 
same time capturing both topical izat ion 
and syntactic roles. Diderichsens grammar 
"Elementmr dansk grammatik" (1946) was 
developed from the 1940's onwards with the 
in tent ion  that it shou ld  be used as a 
common framework for grammar teaching in 
secondary school as well  as on university 
level. This grammar has since served as 
one cornerstone of Danish grammatical 
thought. 
Diderichsen's grammar is distinguished 
by a high degree of formalization, and it 
is one of the aims of the work presented 
in this paper to see how much of the 
original formalism can be implemented 
direct ly as a Prolog program, and whether 
it is necessary to make substantial chan- 
ges in the definit ion and inventory of 
f ields in order to make an executable 
program. 
Prolog Dialect 
The Prolog dialect used is the Danish 
prototype of Borland's TurboProlog. This 
is a typed prolog, and may be termed a 
hybrid between Prolog and Pascal. When 
seeing a sample grammar written in this 
dialect, one is impressed by the clarity 
it achieves: grammatical structures are 
stat ical ly  described in the declarat ion of 
types. The dynamic part which enables one 
to get at these s t ruc tures  are the ru les  
of the program. A further aim of this 
work, then, is to explore whether this 
clar ity wi l l  prevai l  a lso in an elaborate 
grammar program. 
Other Purposes 
Apart from the purpose implicit in the 
aims we bel ieve that field theory offers a 
sound (read: economic) starting point for 
a great variety of parsing purposes. As 
mentioned, the theory offers a combina- 
tion of constituent structure analysis 
with syntactic and thematic analysis. 
This wi l l  not only hold for the Scandi- 
navian languages, but presumably also for 
other Germanic language like English, 
where one might  abandon the S -> NP VP in 
favour  of someth ing  on the l ines  of the 
SVC SVA SV SVO etc. clause patterns of 
Quirk (1972) et al 
In the work presented here, however, 
there is no exploitat ion of the topical i-  
zation faci l it ies offered by the grammar. 
A DANISH FIELD GRAMMAR 
According to Diderichsen, the Danish 
sentence structure has four major fields, 
the connector field, the fundament field, 
the nexus field and the content field. 
The four types are present in main sen- 
tences 
167 
S -> CONN FF NF CF 
and three of them in subordinate ones: 
SS -> CONN S-NF CF 
where all  f ields except the nexus field 
(NF or S-NF) may be empty. 
The CONN is the field for conjunctions. 
The FF (for Fundament Field, which is 
the Danish topical izat ion device) may 
contain any complete constituent, which is 
there as a resu l t  of a movement  from its 
f ield in the sentence: 'Moderen giver 
drengen gaven' vs. 'Gaven giver moderen 
drengen', ('The mother gives the boy a 
gift') where the second version differes 
in its thematical content only: it stres- 
ses the direct object as the theme. 
The NF, for Nexus Field, contains a 
finite verbform, a possible subject plus 
adverbia ls  modifying the verb; the inter- 
nal structure of the nexus field differs 
in main and subordinate clauses. 
The CF, for Content Field, contains two 
possible infinite verbforms, the objects 
and predicates plus adverbial  and other 
modifiers. 
The Grammar Declaration 
So far the project has implemented field 
analysis of both main and subordinate 
sentences. However, not al l  topical iza-  
tions are handled yet: in questions, the 
fundament f ield may be empty too, but this 
is not incorporated in the program, as it 
remains to be seen whether an anlysis with 
the finite topicalized, that is moved into 
the fundament field, would be more fit for 
the purpose. 
Clause  structure 
The fol lowing declarat ions describe main 
and subordinate clauses and furthermore 
the internal structure of the major 
fields: 
S : s( CONN, FUNDF, NEXUSF, CONTENTF ); 
nil; 
s_s( CONN, NEXUSF_S, CONTENTF ) 
CONN = 
nil; 
konj( KONJ ) 
FUNDF = fundf n( NOMINAL ); /* No nil */ 
fundf--a( ADVERBIAL ); 
fundf--i( INF ); 
fundfZc( CONTENTF ) 
NEXUSF : nexusf( FINIT, SUBJ, NADV ) 
NEXUSF_S : nexusf_s( SUBJ, NADV, FINIT ) 
CONTENTF = nil; 
contentf( INFFLD, OBJFLD, 
CADVFLD ) 
These are the major fields. They may in 
turn be divided into subfields: 
INFFLD : nil; 
inffld( INFI, INF2 ) 
means that Danish has a possibi l i ty of two 
auxil iaries, (the finite + one infinite), 
and impl ic i t ly  that if INF2 is fi l led, 
then this w i l l  be the content  verb. This 
treatment is not quite adequate, actual ly, 
but it follows Diderichsen's schema. 
OBJFLD : nil; 
obJfld( NOMINAL, PREPG, NOMINAL ) 
the object field, which at the moment con- 
tains a quick-and-dirty solut ion to the 
problem that the indirect object may be 
expressed by a preposit ional phrase in 
Danish, the solut ion being the incorpora- 
tion of an unwarranted PREP subfield. 
It should be noted in passing, that the 
connector field in Diderichsen's formal ism 
is one of the p laces  where the system wi l l  
not be ab le  to ho ld  on to the or ig ina l .  
Th is  f ie ld  is part of scemata not on ly  for 
sentences, but also for noun- and adver-  
bial phrases, where it may contain i.a. 
preposition. The system thus has to di- 
stinguish between the two types of connec- 
tor f ields in order to avoid the genera- 
tion of spurious analysis results. 
Discontinuous Verbal Particles 
In Danish some verbs are either prefi- 
gated or obl igator ly  constructed with a 
particle, a preposit ion actually, which 
moves  to the end of the sentence  with a l l  
f in i te  forms: 'oplade' ('charge') but 'han 
lader batteriet op', ('he charges the 
battery'); ' lukke op' ('open up') but 'ban 
lukker  d~ren op' ('he opens the -door  up'). 
The same phenomenon exists in German: 
'Peter gab sein rauchen auf'. This is one 
of the places where field grammar shows 
its force as a syntactic strategy, because 
the phenomenon of discontinuity is handled 
in a straightforward way at the first 
level  of analysis: 
ADVFLD = nil; 
cadvfld( CADF, CADF ) 
with 
CADF = nil; 
prep( PREP ); 
cadf( ADVERBIAL ) 
where CADF is the field for i.a. conten- 
tial adverbs, but also for disjunct verbal  
168 
particles. These are acommodated by split- 
ting the original Diderichsen subfield for 
content adverbials into two further sub- 
fields, one of which wil l  contain the 
verbal particle (if any) the other the 
regular content adverbials. This is suffi- 
cient for the declaration of the grammar; 
how our analysis handles the various 
fields wil l  be shown in a later section. 
Phrasal structure 
Syntagmatic structures are also divided 
into fields. As the system stands it is 
implemented for adverbial  phrases, but not 
yet for noun phrases. These are at the 
moment structured in a way, that is pretty 
much on the NP -> Det AdjP N l ines. As 
regards adverbials, the structure given is 
only one of several possible: 
NOMINAL = nil; 
nominal( ART, ADJEKTIVAL, SUBKERN 
PREPP, CS ) 
ADVERBIAL : nil; 
adverbial( CONN, 
DEGREEF, SITUATF, ADVKERN, 
PREPP, CS ) 
The CS is a symbol representing subordi- 
nate sentences, which have the form: 
CS = nil; 
cs( S, SYNT ) 
where S is the field structure, and SYNT 
the corresponding syntactical structure of 
the subordinate sentence represented by 
the token of the symbol type CS. 
Verb phrases, on the other hand, do not 
exist as such. Instead we have: 
FINIT = finit( VERB, VERB, TEMPG ) 
INFINIT = infinit( VERB, VERB, TEMPG ) 
VERB = Symbol 
which means that a verb, whether it be 
finite or infinite, is described by a 
structure, which consists of I) the verbal 
form i t se l f  as it is found in the sentence 
(the first 'VERB'), 2) a lexical unit, 
(the second 'VERB', which wil l  be found as 
a resu l t  of the ana lys i s  of the sentence,  
and which will leave the fields for infi- 
nite form empty) and 3) a complex descrip- 
tion, TEMPG, of tense, aspect, voice, 
modal i ty and the tel ic/atel ic  property of 
the situation described by the verb. This 
TEMPG is used of the sentence as a who le  
also. 
In this way a 'FINIT' in a sentence wil l  
have either an auxiliary, a finite verb- 
form missing the verbal prefix or the 
full, finite form of the content verb in  
the first 'VERB' slot when field analysis 
is carried out. The result of the syntac- 
tical analysis which follows, wil l  be in 
the second 'VERB' slot. 
Syntax 
The system also comprises a syntactic 
part, based on traditional school grammar: 
SYNT = synt( SUBJ, VERB, NADV, SUBJPRED, 
OBJ, OBJPRED, IOBJ, CADV, 
TEMPG ) 
where NADV and CADV are the adverbial 
modifiers of the nexus and the con- 
tentfield respectivi ly. The other mnemo- 
nics should be self  evident. 
The Dictionary 
As the dictionary of the system has not 
been given much attention yet, and as it 
works on a pure ly  ad hoc basis, it w i l l  
not be treated in this paper. 
ANALYSIS 
Analysis runs in two steps, one carrying 
out the field analysis, the other handling 
the syntactical interpretation of the 
result of the field analysis. 
Field Analysys 
Field analysis is carried out by a call  to 
the fol lowing major rule: 
is_s( I, O, s( CONN, FUNDF, NEXUSF, 
CONTENTF  ) ):- 
is forb( I, II, CONN, FEATC ), 
FEATC <> subord, 
is fundf( II, I2, FUNDF ), 
is--nexusf( I2, I3, NEXUSF ), 
is--contentf( I3, O, CONTENTF ). 
which applies the fol lowing rules in order 
to succeed (or fail): 
is_fundf( I, O, fundf n( NOMINAL ) ):- 
is nomen( I, O, NOMINAL  ), I <> O. 
is_fundf( I, O, fundf a( ADVERBIAL ) ):- 
is adverbial( I, O, ADVERBIAL, ), 
I~> O. 
is_nexusf( I, O, nexusf( FINIT, NOMINAL, 
ADVERBIAL ) ):- 
is f init( I, II, F INIT ), 
is -nomen( II, I2, NOMINAL,  _, _ ), 
is~adverbial( I2, O, ADVERBIAL, _ ). 
and 
169 
is contentf( I, O, contentf( INFFLD, 
-- OBJFLD, CADVFLD ) ):- 
is inffld( I, II, INFFLD ), 
is--objfld( II, I2, OBJFLD ), 
is--cadvfld( I2, O, CADVFLD ), 
I~> O. 
is contentf(  I, I, ni l  ). 
As a consequence of having a possible nil- 
f i l l ing for a major field, the content 
field, it becomes necessary to explode the 
number of rules which identify and col lect 
compound verb forms, or in other words 
what is gained in the s impl i c i ty  of the 
grammar is lost again by the number of 
rules. 
Discontinous Verbal Particles 
As an example of the rules handling the 
major  f ields,  we sha l l  take a look at the 
rule, which picks out discontinous verbal 
particles. 
The rules which handle the adverbial  sub- 
field of the content field contain a spe- 
cification for the particles, as they 
a l low for the class of preposit ional ad- 
verbs: 
is cadvfld( I, O, cadvfld( PREPG, 
- -  C ADVERBIAL ) ):- 
is_advprep( I, II,--PREPG ), 
is c adverbial( II, O, C ADVERBIAL ), 
I <> O. 
is cadvfld( I, O, cadvfld( C ADVERBIAL, 
- PREPG ) ) :- 
is c adverbial( I, 11, C ADVERBIAL ), 
is--advprep( II, O, PREPG- ), 
no~_nom( 0 ), I <> O. 
The prepositional adverbs are then picked 
up by the rule: 
is advprep(  I, O, prep( PREP ) ):- 
f ronttoken(  I, PREP, 0 ), 
d ic_prep( X ), X = PREP. 
which in fact is an ad hoc ru le to c i rcum- 
vent the restrictions posed on the system 
be the typing facility. During syntactic 
analysis the disjunct particles are col- 
lected with the verb by the rule 
extract disco vpart, as wil l  be demon- 
strated-in th~ following. 
Syntactic Analysis 
There is one major clause for syntactic 
analysis, 'is_syn', which is cal led by the 
top level anlysis clause 'start': 
start:- 
write("Skriv en smtning"),nl, 
readln( Line ), 
is s( Line, "", S ), 
is~syn( S, SYNT ), 
nl, write("Feltanalyse:"),nl,  
skriv s( S, 0 ), nl, 
nl, w~ite("Syntaktisk analyse:"), nl, 
skriv( SYNT, 0 ), nl, fail. 
is_syn( S, SYNT ):- 
extract_vg( S, VERBI, TEMPG ), 
extract disco vpart( VERBI, S, VERB ), 
extract~advg(--S, NADV, CADV ), 
interpret_nominals( S, VERB, SUBJ, 
SUBJPRED, OBJ, 
OBJPRED, IOBJ ), 
col lect_synt( VERB, NADV, SUBJ, 
SUBJPRED, OBJ, OBJPRED, 
IOBJ, CADV, TEMPG, SYNT ). 
is_syn( nil, nai ). 
The claim was that field grammar faci l i -  
tates syntactic analysis, and we shall  now 
endeavour to support this claim by looking 
at the handling of the noun phrases. 
The major rule is ' interpretnominals' ,  
which has the form: 
interpret nominals( 
s( _, FUNDF, NEXUSF, CONTENTF ), 
VERB, SUBJ, SUBJPRED, 
OBJ, OBJPRED, IOBJ ):- 
syn_nomfund( FUNDF, NEXUSF, CONTENTF, 
VERB, SUBJ, SUBJPRED, 
OBJ, OBJPRED, IOBJ). 
For transit ive verbs the fol lowing 
version of a 'synnomfund'  rule 
generates the f i l ler in the fundament 
field as subject, and two f i l lers to the 
object and indirect object slots; if there 
is only one f i l ler in the object subfield 
this wi l l  be the object: 
syn nomfund( 
~undf n( FUNDFN I ), 
nexus~( _, nil, _ ), 
CONTENTF, 
VERB, subj( FUNDFN 0 ), nil, 
OBJS, nil, IOBJS )T- 
trans verb( VERB, DITRANS ), 
check--sentcomp( FUNDFN I, FUNDFN 0 ), 
extra~t_obj( nil, DITRANS, CONTENTF, 
OBJS, IOBJS ),!. 
where the interesting call is the one to 
'extract obj', where the fol lowing wil l  
match (the 'check_sentcomp' in the fol lo-  
wing rules should be disregarded, as it 
has noth ing to do with the ana lys i s  of the 
arguments proper, it only activates a 
syntactic analysis of a possible clausal 
complement to the given nominal kernels): 
170 
extract obj( nil, _, 
contentf( _, objfld( NOM_I, nil, nil ), 
), 
obj( NOM O--), nil ):- 
check~sentcomp( NOM I, NO~O ),!, 
is_noprep( NOM_O ). 
extract_obJ( nil, DITRA, 
contentf( _, 
objfld( NOMI_I, nil, NOM2_I ), 
), 
obj( NOM20 ), iobj( NOMI O ) ):- 
DITRA--<> nil, 
is noprep( NOMI I ), 
check_sentcomp(--NOM1 I, NOMI 0 ), 
check_sentcomp( NOM2~I, NOM2~O ),l. 
extract_obj( nil, DITRA, 
contentf( _, 
objfld( NOMI_I, prep( PREP ), 
NOM2 I ), 
), 
obj( NOMI O ), iobj( NOM20 ) ):- 
DITRA--<> nil, 
is_noprep( NOMI I ), 
check tilfor( PREP ), 
check~sentcomp( NOMI I, NOMI 0 ), 
check_sentcomp( NOM2~I, NOM2ZO ),!. 
extract_obJ( nil, _, 
contentf()_, nil, _ ), 
nil, nil . 
extract_obJ( nil, _, nil, nil, nil ). 
Even if s imp l i c i ty  is in the eye of the 
beholder, we are confident that the rules 
above are not very complicated. 
It is evident, however, that at least 
one necessary modification to the claim 
must be that the two structures for 'The 
mother gives the boy a present' example: 
s(fundf n(X),nexusf(f init(Y),ni l ,_),  
conte~tf(obJfld(nominal(XX)i , 
nominal(YY) 
s(fundf n(X),nexusf(f init(Y),subj(Z), ), 
contentf(objf ld(obJ1(XX),_,ni l)) 
can only be distinguished from each other 
in ana lys is  by a ca l l  to a rule that 
operates at the lexical level of the verb 
and its arguments. 
Discontinouos Verbal Particles 
In the syntactic analysis, a possible 
discontinous verbal particles is disco- 
vered by the rule extract disco vpart, 
which has the form: 
extract disco_vpart( 
VERBIN, 
S(  _ ,  , __, 
contentf(  , _, 
cadvfld( prep( PREPIN ), 
))), 
VERBOUT ):- 
dic v( VERB, _,_,_,_, ,_,_, discon, _ ), 
VERB = VERBIN, 
dic v discon( VERB, PREP, , ), 
VER~ ~ VERBIN, PREPIN = PREP,- 
concat( VERB, " ", X ), 
concat( X, PREP, VERBOUT ). 
PERFORMANCE 
The system consists of 35 complex gramma- 
tical objects, eg. FUNDF, NOMINAL, with a 
total of 69 possible internal structu- 
rings. There are 18 simple grammatical 
types, eg. INF, ADV. 
There are 77 predicate types for the 
analysis proper, and another 36 types used 
for prettyprinting the results of the 
analysis. 
There are 72 ru les  for the hand l ing  of 
the field grammar analysis, and 74 rules 
for the syntactic analysis. 
F inal ly there are 70 actual rules to the 
36 types of prettyprinting. 
This reflects on one of the shortcomings 
of the typing system: you need a separate 
predicate for each object type you want to 
type out. Up to a certain point one may 
have one predicate type handle several 
object types, but what happens is that 
instead the compiler generates different 
predicate types behind your back. All in 
a l l  one must say, that running on an IBM 
XT you wil l  very soon hit the upper limits 
of the various tables in the compiler, 
when you attempt to exploit the typing 
facil it ies offered. 
The sentence 'den meget gode dreng som 
giver moderen gaven lukker ?i op med et 
redskab' ('The very good boy who gives 
the-mother the-gift opens beer up with a 
tool') takes a total of 21.13 seconds in 
field and syntactic analysis:

Experience has also shown that typed 
Pro log  is a h indrance  for the wr i t ing  of 
rules, which handle different construc- 
tors: the compiler generates separate 
rules for each cnstructor, and that leaves 
you with a severe problem of adequacy of

an IBM XT.

CONCLUSIONS 
As the project is sti l l  running, it is 
too early to propose any firm conclusions. 
It has been seen ,though, that a field 
analysis for Danish is easi ly implemented 
in Prolog, that for the most part short- 
cuts are merely programming conveniences, 
and that typed Prolog using mnemotecnic 
var iable names enhance readabil i ty and 
thereby adaptability. 
On the other hand, our experience has 
shown that expanding the system is easy 
but expensive in process time. When eg. 
subordinate clauses were introduced to 
noun phrases and adverbial  phrases, this 
was a very simple operation in the grammar 
(it required the addition of a single 
symbol) but it had severe consequenses for 
execution time: roughly a 25% increase in 
analysis time for the sentence 'den meget 
gode dreng vil gerne f~ givet moderen den 
gode gave' ('The very good boy wi l l  be- 
happy-to manage-to give the-mother the-
