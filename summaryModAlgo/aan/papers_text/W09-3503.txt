Abstract
Automata theory, transliteration, and machine
translation (MT) have an interesting and inter-
twined history.
Finite-state string automata theory became a
powerful tool for speech and language after
the introduction of the AT&T?s FSM software.
For example, string transducers can convert be-
tween word sequences and phoneme sequences,
or between phoneme sequences and acoustic se-
quences; furthermore, these machines can be
pipelined to attack complex problems like speech
recognition. Likewise, n-gram models can be cap-
tured by finite-state acceptors, which can be re-
used across applications.
It is possible to mix, match, and compose trans-
ducers to flexibly solve all kinds of problems. One
such problem is transliteration, which can be mod-
eled as a pipeline of string transformations. MT
has also been modeled with transducers, and de-
scendants of the FSM toolkit are now used to im-
plement phrase-based machine translation. Even
speech recognizers and MT systems can them-
selves be composed to deliver speech-to-speech
MT.
The main rub with finite-state string MT is word
re-ordering. Tree transducers offer a natural mech-
anism to solve this problem, and they have re-
cently been employed with some success.
In this talk, we will survey these ideas (and their
origins), and we will finish with a discussion of
how transliteration and MT can work together.
