MEANING NEGOTIATION IN DIALOGUE

For  the  sake  o f  e f fec t ive  conmmicat ion  o f  man-mach ine  
type ,  what  seems necessary  i s  to  f ind  means to  dea l  w i th  
complex  language prob lems in  ways that  would  guarantee  i t s  
cor rect  ana lys i s  and synthes is .  Such prob lems can  be  bet ter  
unders tood  when language i s  v iewed not  as  a s ta t i c  p roduct  o f  
in teract ion  but  as  a dynamic ,  mean ing  produc ing  process  in  
ac t ion .  The impor tance  o f  look ing  a t  ongo ing  conmmicat ion  in  
o rder  to  ach ieve  a fu l le r  unders tand ing  o f  the  numerous  l ing -  
u i s t i c  and non l ingu is t i c  dev ices  employed in  the  process  o f  
human communication has been recently emphasized by manyauthors. 
(Clark and Clark'68, Hallday an~ Hasan "76, Garfinkel "72, 
Churchill "78) ? 
The mean ing  o f  an  u t terance :  can  be  cons idered  to  be a 
complex  that  cons is ts  o f  the  semant ic  leve l  a t  the  assumpt ion  
o f  some idea l i za t ion  o f  data ,  the  pragmat ic  leve l ,  e l i c i ted  by 
the  context  and represented  as  a set  o f  ru les  o f  language use ,  
as  we l l  as  the  mater ia l  re fer r ing  to  the  knowledge o f  the  
wor ld .  
A cor rect  ana lys i s  o f  language texts  shou ld  make i t  
poss ib le  to  per fo rm the  c losest  recovery  both  o f  what  was sa id  
and o f  what  was ta lked  about .  The in fo rmat ion  requ i red  to  
in terpret  and  reproduce  an  ut terance  i s  not  fu l l y  and  unambig -  
uous ly  encoded in  the  speech  s igna l ,  but  i s  completed  by the  
mater ia l  conta ined  in  sets  o f  const ra in ts  fami l ia r  to  each  o f  
the  in ter locutors .  I f  the  re la t ions  between the  s igna l  and  the  
'~ - 182 - 
i 
content  correspond to genera l ly  accepted  ru les  ( syntact i c ,  
semant ic ,  p ra~at ic ) ,  fu r thermore ,  i f  the re la t ions  in tended 
by the sender  are  ident i ca l  to  those apprehended by the rece iv -  
e r ,  the co~nun icat ion  i s  convent iona l  (Al lwood?76).  Conversat -  
ion ,  and most exp l i c i t l y ,  d ia logue ,  i s  a cont inuous  recover -  
ing  of  the above re la t ions .  The i ssue  o f  whether  those fac tors  
are ent i re ly  or  par t ly  ident i ca l  or  d i f fe rent  to  the par t i -  
c ipants  i s  be ing es tab l i shed  in  the process  o f  the whole 
in teract ion .  Hence, meaning o f  an u t te rance  i s  not  a constant  
but a variable the value of which is negotiated in the course 
of interaction. Applying Ninsky "s terms (~insk~7 "75) what 
takes place there is the process of filling in "default"val-  
ues in prototypes, u~derstood here as hiersrchically organized 
data structures, representing partial but "constant" knowledge, 
with the variable defaults, empty, prior to the concrete act 
of perception. This, in turn, leads either to activating 
familiar conventional or stereotypical conceptual frames or 
stimulates instantiating new data structures if the higher 
"constant" nodes in the structure are replaced. A number of 
man-machine communication systems (FRL-Roberts, Goldstein, 
KRL - Bobrow, Winograd, Norman, Kay - cf. Jirk~ "81 for deta- 
ils) work accord ing  to  s imi la r  schemes,  which makes i t  poss ib -  
le  fo r  them to inc lude  sets  o f  in fe rence  ru les  in  the i r  
systems.  
In fe rence  ru les  under ly ing  human as we l l  as man-machine 
co~nmicat ion  can be represented  in  terms of  data  s t ruc ture  
reconf igurat ions  accord ing  to known typo log ica l  c r i te r ia  such 
as hyponymy, quant i f i ca t ion ,  de le t ions ,  add i t ions ,  e tc .  Such 
changes can be perce ived  as opaque by par t i c ipants  due to the 
lack of transparency in the linguistic form of the utterance. 
Another problem in this connection is that even in the simpl- 
est forms of dialogue, question answering, the chain maxim, 
i.e. respondlng with a direct answer to the question, is 
- 183  - 
s t r i c t ly  fo l lowed in  only a smal l  percentage of cases (12 - 
24 % of oases - Church i l l  op. o i t . ) .  Other responses exh ib i t  
a number of forms andpat terns  rangin8 from most convent iona l  
(conforming) to most devtant .  Dev iat ions  from the d i rec t  
pat terns  can be h ie rarcb /ca l ly  c lass i f ied  accord ing to breach-  
es of conversat iona l  maxims. 
In  order  then,  to cor rec t ly  ana lyse  such and s imi la r  
d ia logues  as the fo l low ing  (a f te r  Church i l  op .o i t . ;  103): 
Speaker1: rny  are we go ingw~7 out in  the middle? 
I'll get sunburned 
Speaker2: What 's  the d i f fe rence  whether you ' re  in  the middle 
or not?  
Speaker1: You get  more re f lec t ion  in  the middle 
Speaker2: Oh.
