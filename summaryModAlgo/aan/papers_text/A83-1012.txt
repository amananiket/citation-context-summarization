ABSTRACT 
The natura l  language database query system 
incorporated  in the KNOBS in teract ive  p lanning 
system comprises a d ic t ionary  dr iven parser ,  
APE-II ,  and sc r ip t  in te rpreter  which y ie ld  a 
conceptual  dependency conceptua l i za t ion  as a 
representat ion  of the manning of user  input .  A 
conceptua l i za t ion  pat tern  matching product ion 
system then determines and executes  a procedure for  
ext rac t ing  the des i red  in format ion from the 
database .  In cont ras t  to syntax dr iven Q-A 
systems,  e .$ . ,  those based on ATH parsers ,  AFE-II

word ~ean ings .  The procesa in  K of a query i s  based 
on the contents  of severa l  knowledge sources 
inc lud ing the d ic t ionary  ent r ies  (par t ia l  
conceptua l i za t ions  and the i r  expectat ions ) ,  frames 
represent ing  conceptual  dependency pr imi t ives ,  
sc r ip ts  which conta in  s te reotyp ica l  knowledge about

resu l t ing  from act ions ,  and two product ion system 
ru le  bases for the in ference  of imp l i c i t  case

of which are cur rent ly  at leas t  par t ia l l y  achieved,  
inc lude u t i l i z ing  s imi la r  representat ions  for  
quest ions  with s imi la r  meanings but widely vary ing 
sur face  s t ruc tures ,  developing a powerful mechanism 
for the d isambiguat iou of words with mul t ip le  
meanings and the determinat ion  of pronoun 
re ferents ,  answering quest ions  which requ i re  
in ferences  to be understood,  and in terpret ing  
e l l ipses  and unBra--nat ical  u t te rances .  
THE SETTING 
The KNOBS \[Engelman, 1980\] demonstrat ion 
system is an exper imenta l  expert  system provid ing 
consu l tant  services to an Air Force tactical air 
mission planner. The KNOBS database consists of 
severa l  nets  of f rames,  implemented with in  an 
extens ion  of FRL \ [Roberts,  1977\], represent ing  both 
i nd iv idua l  and gener ic  c lasses  of ta rgets ,  
resources ,  and planned miss ions .  The KNOBS system 
supports a planner by checking the consistency of 
plan components, enumerating or ranking poss ib le  
choices for plan components, or automatically 
generating a complete  plan. Because these 
activities are accomplished by means of rules and 
constraints expressible in English, KNOBS will 
hopefully be a relatively easy system to learn. 
For the same reasons ,  it is  a l so  being cons idered 
as an a id to t ra in  mission p lanners .  The natura l  
language subsystem of KNOBS p lays  severa l  ro les  
inc lud ing  those of database query,  database update,  
co~uand language,  plan de f in i t ion ,  and the add i t ion  
or modification of production system ru les  
represent ing  domain knowledge. The moat developed 
of these is  database query,  upon which th i s  paper 
w i l l  focus .  
The balance of th i s  paper will f i r s t  out l ine  
the use of conceptual  dependency and mention some 
pr io r  re la ted  work and then descr ibe  the severa l  
knowledge sources and the par ts  they p lay in the 
pars ing  of the input  query .  F ina l ly ,  i t  w i l l  
descr ibe  the method of der iv ing  the appropr ia te  
database search and output  response as wel l  as a 
sc r ip t -based  approach to  i n te rpret t ing  COmmands. 
USE OF CONCEPTUAL DEPENDENCY 
APE-If ut i l i zes  Conceptual  Dependency theory 
\[Schank, 1972\] to  represent  the meaning of 
questions. Once the meaning of a question has been 
found, the quest ion  is  answered by a ru le  based 
system whose teats  are CD pat terns  and whose 
act ions  execute database quer ies .  
We fee l  i t  i s  important to represent  the 
meaning in th i s  manner for  severa l  reasons .  F i r s t ,  
the canonica l  meaning representat ion  enables 
quest ions  which have d i f fe rent  sur face  express ions ,  
but the same meanins,  to be answered by the same 
mechanikm. This is  not only of theoret i ca l  
s i sn i f i cance ,  but is  a lso  a prac t i ca l  mat ter  as i t  
requ i res  less  e f fo r t  to  produce a robust  system. 
Because people do not always say prec i se ly  
what they mean, in fe rences  may be requ i red  to 
exp l i ca te  miss ing  in format ion .  This in ference 
process  can a lso  u t i l i ze  the canonica l  meaning 
representat ion .  F ina l ly ,  f ind ing  the re fe rent  Qf a 
nominal which is  modified by a relative clause is, 
in some cases, similar to question answering 
although the syntactic constructions used differ. 
As a result of this similarity, the question 
answering productions can also be used for 
determining the referents of a relative clause. 
The conversation with KNOBS (whose database is 
fictional) in Fig. 1 illustrates these points. 
The first question is represented in the same 
manner as "Does Ramstein have F-4G's?" and would 
be answered by the same rule. The second question, 
73 
USER: Are there F-4G's at Ramatein? 
KNOBS: RAMSTEIN has F-4Ga. 
USER: Can i t s  fighters reach the target? 
KNOBS: F-15e can reach SE50301 from RA~SIEIN. 
F-4Ge and F-dCa can not reach BEb0301 from RA~STEIN. 
USER: Which SCL which are carried by an F-dC contain ECM? 
KNOBS: Sl, S7 and BB. 
F~guve i. A Question Answering Interchange withi, KN08S. 
after resolving the pronominal reference, requires 
an inference to find the location from which the 
F-4G's will be leaving. This inference states that 
if the source of the object of a physical transfer 
is missing, then the source could be the initial 
location of the object. The third question can be 
thought of as two questions: "Which SCL (Standard 
Configuration Load - a predefined weapons package) 
are carried by an F-dC?" and "Which of those 
contain ECM (Electronic Counter Measures - radar 
jamming equipment)?". The first part requires a 
scr ip t  based  in fe rence :  In o rder  fo r  an SCL to be 
car r ied  by an a i rc ra f t ,  the  a i rc ra f t  must  be 
capab le  of  hav ing  the  SCL as a par t .  A f te r  the  
f i r s t  par t  i s  answered  as a quest ion ,  the  second 
part is answered as a second question to discover 
which contain ECM. 
The sys tem of  representat ion  used fo r  nomina ls  
(or  p ic ture  producers )  d i f fe rs  from that  normal ly  
p resent  in a CD sys tem.  Typ ica l ly ,  an ob jec t  such  
as an F-4C would be represented  as a p ic ture  
producer with a TYPE case filled by VEHICLE, a 
SUBTYPE case filled by aircraft, and, perhaps, a 
MODEL case filled by F-4C. In KNOBS, the meaning 
representation produced by the parser is F-dC, the 
name of a frame. The set membership of this frame 
is indicated by links to other frames. F-dC is a 
kind of FIGHTER which is a kind of AIRPLANE which 
is an A IRCR~T which is a VEHICLE which is a 
PICTURE PRODUCER. We feel that representing 
nominals in this manner allows a finer degree of 
discrimination than explicitly labeled cases to 
denote a conceptual hierarchy. 
Many o f  the  a t t r ibutes  of  ob jec ts  in the  
database  (which are  s to red  as va lue  facets  of  s lo ts  
in FRL) a re  represented  as k inds  of  RELATIONS in 
the  KNOBS sys tem.  For example ,  the  representat ion  
of "Hahn's Latitude" is (LATITUDE ARGUMENT (HAHN)). 
Note, however, chat the representation of "Hahn's 
aircraft" is (AIRCRAFT LOC (AT PLACE (HAHN))). 
PREVIOUS WORK 
We would like to distinguish the KNOBS natural 
language facility from such familiar natural 
language query systems as LADDER \[Hendrix, 1978\] 
and LUNAR \[Woods, 1972\] in both function and 
method. The functional model of the above systems 
is that of someone with a problem to solve and a 
database containing information useful in its 
solution which he can access via a natural language 
interface. KNOBS, by contrast, integrates the 
natural language capability with multi-faceted 
problem solving support including critiquing and 
Benerating tactical plans. Our approach differs in 
method from these  prev ious  sys tems in  i t s  
bot tom-up ,  d ic t ionary  dr iven  pars ing  which resu l t s  
in  a canon ica l  representat ion  of  the  mean ing  of  the  
query ,  i t s  ab i l i ty  to per fo rm context  dependent  
in fe rences  w i th  th i s  representat ion  dur ing  quest ion  
answer ing ,  and the  use  o f  a dec la ra t ive  
representat ion  o f  the  domain to ass i s t  pars in  S,  
quest ion  answer ing ,  p lan  updat ing ,  and in fe renc ing .  
A sys tem s imi la r  to APE- I f  in  both  i t s  
d icc ionarydr iven  approach  to pars ins  and ice  
d i rec t  a t tack  on word sense  d i sambiguat ion  i s  the  
Word Expert Parser (WEP) \[Small, 1980\]. This 
parser associates a discrimination net with each 
word to guide the meanin 8 selection process. Each 
word in a sentence is a pointer to a coroutine 
called a word expert which cooperates with 
neighboring words to build a meanin S representation 
of the sentences in a bottom-up, i.e., data driven, 
fashion. At each node in the discrimination net a 
multiple-choice test i s  executed which can query 
the lexical properties or expectations, 
(selectional restrictions \[Katz, 1963\]) of 
neighboring words, or proposed FOCUS, ACTIVITY, and 
DISCOURSE modules. The sense selection process of 
WEP requ i res  that  each  word know a l l  o f  the  
contexts in which its senses can occur. For 
example, to find the meaning of "pit", the pit 
expert can ask if a MINING-ACTIVITY, EATING-ACTION, 
CAR-RACINC, or MUSIC-CONCERT-ACTION is active. 
APE- I I  evo lved  from APE (A Pars ing  
Exper iment ) ,  a parser  used  by the  DSAM 
(D is t r ibutab le  Scr ip t  App ly ing  Mechanism) and ACE 
(Academic Counse l ing  Exper t )  p ro jec ts  a t  the  
University of Connecticut \[Cullingford, 1982\]. APE 
is based on the CA parser \[Birnbaum, 1981\] with the 
addition of a word sense disambiguation algorithm. 
In CA, word definitions are represented as 
requests, a type of test-action pair. The test 
part of a request can check lexical and semantic 
features of neighboring words; the actions create 
or connect CD structures, and activate or 
deactivate other requests. 
The method available to select the appropriate 
meaning of a word in CA is to use the test part of 
separate requests to examine the meanings of other 
words and co build a meaning representation as 
function of this local context. For example, if 
the objeet of "serve" is a food, the meaning is 
"bring to"; if the object is a ball, the meaning is 
"hit toward". This method works well for selecting 
a sense of a word which has expectations. However, 
some words have no expectations and the intended 
sense is the one that is expected. For example, 
the proper sense of "ball" in "John kicked the 
ball." and "John attended the ball." is the sense 
which the central action expects. 
The word definitions of APE are also 
represented as requests. A special concept called a 
VEL is used to represent the set of possible 
meanings of a word. When searching for a concept 
which has certain semantic features, an expectation 
can select one or more senses from a VEL and 
74 
d iscard  those that  are not appropr ia te .  In 
add i t ion ,  APE can use expectat ions  from a 
contextua l  knowledge source such as a sc r ip t  
app l ie r  to se lec t  a word sense .  Each sc r ip t  i s  
augmented w i th  parser  executab le  expectat ions  
ca l led  named requests .  For example, aCa  cer ta in  
po in t  in unders tand ing  a res taurant  s to ry ,  leav ing 
? t ip  fo r  the wa i te r  i s  expected.  The parser  is  
then g iven a named request  which could help 
disambiguate the words "leave" and "tip", should 
they appear .  
APE-II 
A word de f in i t ion  in APE-I I  cons is ts  of  the 
set  of  a l l  of i t s  senses .  Each sense conta ins  ? 
concept ,  i .e . ,  ? par t ia l  CD s t ructure  which 
expresses  the meaning of th i s  sense ,  and a set  of 
conceptua l  and lex ica l  expectat ious .  
A conceptua l  expectat ion  ins t ructs  the parser  
to look for  a concept in s cer ta in  re la t ive  
pos i t ion  which meets a se lec t iona l  res t r i c t ion .  
The expectat ion  a l so  conta ins  a se lec t iona l  
p re ference ,  a more spec i f i c ,  p re fer red  category  fo r  
the expected concept (c f .  \[Wilkg, 1972\]) .  I f  such 
a concept is found, the expectat ion  conta ins  
in fo rmat ion  on how i t  can be combined wi th  the 
concept which in i t ia ted  the expectat ion .  A lex ica l  
expectat ion  ins t ructs  the parser  to look fo r  a 
cer ta in  word and add a new, favored sense to i t .  
This p rocess  is  use fu l  for  p red ic t ing  the funct ion  
of a prepositiou \[Reisbeck, 1976\ ] .  The definition 
of a pronoun utilizes a context and focus mechanism 
co f ind the set  of poss ib le  re ferents  which agree 
with i t  in number and gender .  THE PRONOUN IS THEN 
TREATED LIKE A WORD WITH MULTIPLE SENSES. The 
definitions of the words "fly", "eat" and "A/C" are 
shown in F ig.  2. 
The definition of "A/C" states that it means 
AIRCRAFT or AIR-CONDITIONER. APE-If uses 
se lec t iona l  restrictions to choose the proper sense 
of "A/C" in the question "What A/C can fly from 
Hahn?". On the other hand, in the sentence "Send 4 
A/C to BE70701.", APE-II utilizes the facts that 
the OCA script is active, and that sending aircraft 
to a target is a scene of that script, Co determine 
that "A/C" means AIRCRAFT. In the question "What 
is  an A/C?", APE-II  uses  a weaker argument to 
reso lve  the potent ia l  ambigu i ty .  I t  u t i l i zes  the 
fact  that  AIRCRAFT is  an ob ject  that  can perform a 
ro le  in the OCA scr ip t ,  whi le an AIR-CONDITIONER 
cannot. 
The definition of "fly" states that it means 
FLY which is a kind of physical transfer. The 
expectations associated with fly state the 
actor of the sentence (i.e., a concept which 
precedes the action in a d~clarative sentence, 
follows "by" in a passive sentence, or appears in 
var ious  p laces in quest ions ,  e tc . )  is  expected to 
be an AIRCRAFT in which case it is the OBJECT of 
FLY or is expected to be a BIRD in which case it is 
both the ACTOR and the OBJECT of the physical 
transfer. This is the expectation which can select 
the intended sense of "A/C". If the word "~o" 
75 
appears ,  i t  might serve  the funct ion  of ind icat ing  
the filler of the TO case of FLY. The word "from" 
is given a similar definition, which would fill the 
FROM case with the object of the preposition which 
: shou ld  be a PICTURE-PRODUCER but is pre fer red  to be 
a LOCATION. 
The definition of "eat"  conta ins  an 
expectat ion  with s se lec t iona l  p re ference  which 
i nd icates  that  the ob jec t  i s  p re fer red  to be food.  
This pre ference  serves  another  purpose a l so .  The 
ob jec t  w i l l  be converted to a food i f  poss ib le .  
For example, if the object were "chicken" then this 
convers ion  would asser t  that  i t  i s  a dead and 
cooked ch icken.  
We v i l i  f i r s t  d i scuss  the pars ing  process  as 
i f  sentences  could be parsed in i so la t ion  and then 
exp la in  how i t  i s  augmented to account  fo r  context .  
The s impl i f ied  pars ing  process  cons is ts  of  adding 
the senses  of  each word to an ac t ive  memory, 
cons ider ing  the expectat ions ,  and removin E concepts  
( senses)  which are not connected to o ther  concepts .  
Word sense d i sambiguat ion  and the reso lu t ion  
of  pronominal  re ferences  are achieved by severa l  
mechanisms. Se lec t iona l  res t r i c t ions  can be 
he lp fu l  to reso lve  m-b igu i t ies .  For example, many 
act ions  requ i re  an animate ac tor .  I f  there  are 
severa l  cho ices  fo r  the ac tor ,  the inanimate ones 
w i l l  be weeded out .  Converse ly ,  i f  there  are 
severa l  cho ices  fo r  the main ac t ion ,  and the ac tor  
has been es tab l i shed  as an imate,  then ~hose act ions  
which require an inanimate actor will be discarded. 
Se lect iona l  p re ferences  are  used in add i t ion  to 
se lec t ioua l  res t r i c t ions .  For example, i f  "eat"  
has an ob jec t  which is  a pronoun whose possible 
re ferents  are a food and a co in ,  the food w i l l  be 
pre fer red  and the coin d i scarded  as a poss ib le  
re ferent .  
A conf l i c t  reso lu t ion  mechanism is  invoked i f  
more than one concept sa t i s f ies  the res t r i c t ions  
and pre ferences .  This cons is ts  of us ing 
"conceptua l  const ra in ts"  to determine i f  the CD 
s t ructure  which would be bu i l t  is  p laus ib le .  These 
const ra in ts  are pred icates  assoc ia ted  wi th  CD 
pr imi t ives .  For example, the locat iona l  spec i f ie r  
INSIDE has a const ra in t  which s ta tes  that  the 
contents  must be smal le r  than the conta iner .  
The d i snmbiguat ion  process  can make use of the 
knowledge s t ructures  which represent  s tereotyp ica l  
domain in fo rmat ion .  The conf l i c t  reso lu t ion  
a lgor i thm a lso  determines  i f  the CD s t ructure  which 
would be bu i l t  re fe rs  to a scene in an ac t ive  
script and prefers to build this type of 
conceptualization. At the end of the parse, if 
there is an ambiguous nominal, the possibilities 
are matched against the roles of the active 
scripts. Nominals which can be a script role are 
preferred. 
A planned extension to the parsing algorithm 
consists of augmenting the definition of a word 
sense with information about whether it is an 
uncommonly used sense, and the contexts in which i? 
could be used (see \[Charniak, 1981\]). Only some 
senses will be added to the active memory and if

QUESTION ANSWERING 
Af ter  the meaning of a quest ion  has been 
represented ,  the quest ion  is  answered by means of 
pat tern - invoked ru les .  Typ ica l ly ,  the pat tern  
matching process  b inds var iab les  to the major 
nominals  in a quest ion  conceptua l i za t ion .  The 
re ferents  of these  nominals  are  used in execut ing  a 
database query which f inds  the answer to the user ' s  
quest ion .  A l though the quest ion  conceptua l i za t ion  
and the answer could be used to generate  a natura l  
language response  \[Goldman, 1975\],  the cur rent  
response  fac i l i ty  merely subst i tu tes  the answer and 
re ferents  in a canned response  procedure  assoc ia ted  
with each quest ion  answer ing ru le .  
The question answering rules are organized 
according to the context in which they are 
appropriate, i.e., the conversational script 
\[Lehnert, 1978\], and according to the primitive of 
the conceptualization and the "path to the focus" 
of the question. The path to the focus of a 
question is considered to be the path of conceptual 
cases which leads to the subconcept in question. 
A quest ion  answer ing  product ion  is  d i sp layed  
in F ig .  3. I t  i s  a de fau l t  pat tern  des igned to 
answer quest ions  about  which ob jec ts  are at  a 
locat ion .  This  pat tern  is  used to answer the 
quest ion  "~hat f ighters  do the a i rbasee  in West 
Gerlmny have?" .  In  th i s  example,  the pat tern  
var iab les  &LOC is  bound to the meaning 
representat ion  of  " the  a i rbases  in West Germany" 
and &OBJECT is bound to the meaning representation 
of "fighters". The action is then executed and the 
referent of &OBJECT is found to be (FIGHTER) and 
the referent of &LOC is found to be (HAHN SEMBACH 
BITBURG). The fighters at each of these locations 
is found and the variable ANSWER is bound to the 
value of MAPPAIR: 
((HAHN . (F-4C F-15)) (SEMBACH . NIL) 
(BITBURG . (F -~ F-15))). 
The response facet of the question answering 
production reformats the results of the action to 
merse locations with the same set of objects. The 
answer "There are none at Sembach. Hahn and 
Bitburg have F-4Cs and F-15s." is printed on 
success ive  i te ra t ione  of  PMAPC. 
The product ion  in F ig.  3 is  used to answer 
most quest ions  about ob jec ts  aC a locat ion .  I t  
invokes a genera l  funct ion  which f inds  the subset  
of ~he par ts  of a locat ion  which belong to a 
certain class. The OCA (offensive counter air) 
script used by the KNOBS system contains a more 
specific pattern for answering question about the 
defenses of a location. This production is used to 
answer the question "What SAMe are at BE70701?". 
The action of this production executes a procedure 
which finds the subset of the surface to air 
missiles whose range is greater than the distance 
to the location.

requ i red  to in fe r  the f i l l e rs  of conceptua l  cases .  
Our conceptua l  complet ion in fe rences  are expressed  
as ru les  represented  and organized in a manner 
analogous to quest ion  answer ing ru les .  The path  to 
the focus of a conceptua l  complet ion in fe rence  ie 
the conceptua l  case which i t  is  intended co 
exp l ioate .  Conceptual  complet ion in fe rences  are 
run only when necessary ,  i .e . ,  when requ i red  by the 
pat tern  m4tcher to enable a quest ion  answer ing 
pat tern  (or  even another  in fe rence  pat tern)  to 
match success fu l ly ,  
An example conceptua l  complet ion in fe rence  is  
i l l us t ra ted  in FiE. 4. I t  is  des igned to in fe r  the 
miss ing  source of a phys ica l  t rans fer .  The pat tern  
binds the var iab le  &OBJECT co the f i l l e r  of the 
OBJECT ro le  and thq act ion  executes  a funct ion  
which looks at the LOCATION case of &OBJECT or 
checks the database for the known location of the 
referent of &OBJECT. This inference would not be 
used in processin E the question "Which aircraft at 
Ramstein could reach the target from Hahn?" because 
the source has been explicitly stated. It would be 
used,  on the o ther  hand, in p rocess ing  the 
quest ion ,  "Which a i rc ra f t  at Ramstein can reach the 
ta rget?" .  I t s  e f fec t  would be to f i l l  the FROM 
s lo t  of the quest ion  conceptua l i za t ion  with

Ftgure 4; A Concelat Completion Inference. 
If a quest ion  answer ing product ion  cannot be 
found to respond to a quest ion ,  and the quest ion  
re fers  Co a scene in an ac t ive  sc r ip t ,  causa l  
in fe rences  are used CO f ind  an answerable  quest ion  
vh ich  can be const ructed  as a s ta te  or  ac t ion  
~upl iad by the or ig ina l  quest ion .  These in fe rences  
are  represented  by causa l  links \[CullinKford, 1978\] 
which connect the lC l te l  and act ions  of a 
s tereotyp ica l  s i tuat ion .  The causa l  l inks  used fo r  
th i s  type of in fe rence  are RESULT (ac t ions  can 
resu l t  in s ta te  changes) ,  ENABLE (s ta tes  can enable  
ac t ion) ,  and EESULT-ENA3LE (an act ion  resu l t s  in a 
s ta te  which enab les  an ac t ion) .  This las t  
in fe rence  is  so coumon that  i t  is  g iven a spec ia l  
l i nk .  In  soma cases ,  the in termed ia te  s ta te  is  
un impor tant  or  unknown. In  add i t ion  to causa l  
l inks ,  temporal  l inks  are a l so  represented  to 
reason  about the sequencing of ac t ions .  
The causal inference process consists of 
locating a script paCtern of an active script which 
represents  the scene of the sc r ip t  re fer red  to by a 
quest ion .  The pat tern  matchfnE a lgor i thm assures  
that  the constants  ~n the pat tern  are a super -c lass  
of the constants in the conceptual hierarchy of FRL 
frames. The variables in script patterns are the 
script roles which represent the common objects and 
actors of the script. The binding of script roles 
to subconcepts of a question conceptualization is 
subject to the recursive matching of patterns which 
indicate the common features of the roles. (This 
will be explained in more detail in the section on 
interactive script instantiation.) After the scene 
referenced by the user question is identified, a 
new question concept is constructed by substituting 
ro le  b ind ings  in to  pat terus  represent ing  s ta tes  or 
actions linked to the identified scene.

At-HIT-TARGET represents  the prope l l ing  of a weapon 
toward the ta rget .  It resu l t s  in the dest ruct ion  of 
the ta rget ,  and i s  followed by the a i rc ra f t  f l y ing  
back Co the a i rbase .  
The knowledge represented  by these  sc r ip t  
pat terns  is  needed to answer the quest ion  "What 
aircraft at Hahn can strike BE70701?". The answer 
produced by KNOBS, "Y-15s can reach BE70701 from 
Hahn.", requires a causal inference and a concept  
completion inference. The first step in producing 
this answer is to represent the meaning of the 
sentence .  The conceptua l i za t ion  produced by APE-I f  
i s  shown in F ig .  6a. A search  fo r  a quest ion  
answering pat tern  to answer this fails, so causal 
inferences are tried. The question concept is 
identified Co he the AC-HIT-TARGET scene of the 0CA 
script, and the scene which RESULT-ENABLEs it, 
AC-FLY-TO-TARGET is instantiafied. This new 
question conceptualization is displayed in Fig 6b. 
A question answering pattern whose focus is (OBJECT 
IS-A) is found which could match the inferred 
question (Fig. 6c). To enable this pattern to match 
the inferred question, the FROM case must be 
inferred. This is accompl ished by a concept  
completion inference which produces the complete 
conceptualization shown in Fig. 6d. Finally, the 
action and response of the question answering are 
executed to calculate and print ~n answer. 
INTERACTIVE SCRIPT INSTANTIATION 
The script patterns which describe the 
relationships among the scenes of a situation are 
also used by the KNOBS system to guide a 
conversation about that domain. The conversation 
with KNOBS in Fig. 7 illustrates the entering of 
plan components by interactively insCantiating 
script patterns. 
The first user sentence instantiaces two 
script patterns (the flying of aircraft, and the 
s t r i k ing  of a ta rget )  and binds the sc r ip t  ro les :  
TARGET Co BE70501, WING to 109TFW, AIRCRAFT-NUMBER 
to 4,  and TIME-OVER-TARGET to 0900. KNOB~ asks the 
user  to se lec t  the AIRCRAFT. Because the user  
replied with a question whose answer is an 
aircraft, KNOBS asks if the user would like would 
like to use chat  aircraft am a component of the 
deve lop ing  p lan .  This i s  accompl i shed by a ru le  
that  i s  ac t ivated  when KNOBS asks  the user  to 
spec i fy  a p lan  component.  The in terpretat ion  of  the 
user  s negat ive  answer is  handled by s ru le  
ac t ivated  when KNOBS asks a yes -no  quest ion .  KNOBS 
checks the cons is tency  of the user ' s  answer and 
exp la ins  a const ra inc  which has fa i led .  Then, the 
user  cor rects  th i s  problem,  and KNOBS processes  the 
ext ra  information supp l ied  by matching the meaning 
of the user ' s  input  to a sc r ip t  pat tern .

TRANSFERRING DOMAINS 
To demonstrate  the i r  domain independence,  the 
KNOBS System and APE-II have been prov ided wi th  
knowledge bases to plan and answer quest ions  about 
naval  "show of f lag"  miss ions .  This  vers ion  of 
KNOBS a lso  uses FRL as a database language.  
A l a rge  por t ion  of the quest ion  answer ing 
capab i l i ty  was d i rec t ly  app l i cab le  fo r  a number of 
reasons .  F i r s t  of all, d ic t ionary  ent r ies  fo r  
frames are const ructed  automat ica l ly  when they 
appear in a user  query.  The de f in i t ions  of the 
a t t r ibutes  ( s lo ts )  of a frame which are represented  
as RELATIONs are a l so  const ructed  when needed. The 
definitions of many common words such as "be", 
"have", "a", "of", etc., would be useful in 
understanding questions in any domain. The 
question answering productions and concept 
completion inferences are separated into default 
and domain specific categories. Many of the simple 
but common queries are handled by default patterns. 
For example, "Which airbases have fighters?" and 
"What ports have cruisers?" are answered by the 
same default pattern. Currently, the Navy version 
of KNOBS has 3 domain specific question answering 
pat terns ,  compared to 22 in the Air  Force vers ion .  
(There are  46 de fau l t  pat terns . )  The most 
impor tant  knowledge s t ructure  miss ing  in the Navy 
domain is the sc r ip ts  which are  needed to per form 
causa l  in fe rences  and d ia log  d i rec ted  p lann ing .  
There fore ,  the system can answer the quest ion  "What 
weapons does the Nimitz have?" ,  but  can ' t  answer 
'~ihat weapons does the NimiCz car ry?" .  
CONCLUSION 
We have argued that  the process ing  of natura l  
languaae database  quer ies  should be dr iven  by the 
meaning of the input ,  as determined pr imar i ly  by 
the emaninss  of the const i tuent  words.  The 
zuechanisms prov ided for  word sense se lec t ion  and 
fo r  the in fe rence  of miss ing  meaning e lements  
u t i l i ze  a var ie ty  of  knowledge sources .  I t  i s  
be l ieved  Chat th i s  approach w i l l  prove more genera l  
and extens ib le  than those based ch ie f ly  on the 
sur face  s t ruc ture  of  the natura l  language query .
