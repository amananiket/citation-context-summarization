Abstract
This paper investigates the roles of named
entities (NE?s) in annotated biomedical text
classification. In the annotation schema of
BioCaster, a text mining system for pub-
lic health protection, important concepts that
reflect information about infectious diseases
were conceptually analyzed with a formal
ontological methodology. Concepts were
classified as Types, while others were iden-
tified as being Roles. Types are specified
as NE classes and Roles are integrated into
NEs as attributes. We focus on the Roles
of NEs by extracting and using them in
different ways as features in the classifier.
Experimental results show that: 1) Roles
for each NE greatly helped improve perfor-
mance of the system, 2) combining informa-
tion about NE classes with their Roles con-
tribute significantly to the improvement of
performance. We discuss in detail the effect
of each Role on the accuracy of text classifi-
cation.
1 Introduction
Today, the Internet is a powerful tool for discov-
ering novel information via news feed providers.
This is becoming increasingly important for the
public health domain because it can help to de-
tect emerging and re-emerging diseases. In infec-
tious disease surveillance systems such as the Global
Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN) sys-
tem (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2004) and
ProMed-Mail (International Society for Infectious
Diseases, 2001), the detection and tracking of out-
breaks using the Internet has been proven to be a
key source of information for public health work-
ers, clinicians, and researchers interested in com-
municable diseases. The basis for such systems is
the monitoring of a large number of news articles
simultaneously. The classification of news articles
into disease-related or none disease-related classes
is the first stage in any automated approach to this
task. In practice though there are a large number of
news articles whose main subject is related to dis-
eases but which should not necessarily be notified
to users together with a relatively small number of
high priority articles that experts should be actively
alerted to. Alerting criteria broadly include news re-
lated to newly emerging diseases, the spread of dis-
eases across international borders, the deliberate re-
lease of a human or engineered pathogen, etc. The
use of only raw text in the classification process in-
evitably fails to resolve many subtle ambiguities, for
example semantic class ambiguities in polysemous
words like ?virus?, ?fever?, ?outbreak?, and ?con-
trol? which all exhibit a variety of senses depending
on context. These different senses appear with rela-
tively high frequency in the news especially in head-
lines. A further challenge is that diseases can be de-
noted by many variant forms. Therefore we consider
that the use of advanced natural language process-
ing (NLP) techniques like named entity recognition
(NER) and anaphora resolution are needed in order
to achieve high classification accuracy.
Text classification is defined as the task of as-
signing documents into one or more predefined cat-
17
egories. As shown by (Cohen and Hersh, 2005),
an accurate text classification system can be espe-
cially valuable to database curators. A document in
the biomedical domain can be annotated using NER
techniques with enriched semantic information in
the form of NEs such as the disease, pathogen, loca-
tion, and time. NER and term identification in gen-
eral have been recognized as an important research
topic both in the NLP and biomedical communities
(Krauthammer and Nenadic, 2004). However, an in-
vestigation into the contribution of NEs on the per-
formance of annotated biomedical text classification
has remained an open question until now. There are
two main reasons for this: Firstly there are a small
number of open annotation schema for biomedical
text, and secondly there is no benchmark annotated
data for testing.
The BioCaster project (Collier, 2006) is working
towards the detection and tracking of disease out-
breaks from Internet news articles. Although there
are several schema for biomedical text (Wilbur et al,
2006), little work has been done on developing one
specifically for public health related text. BioCaster
therefore provides an annotation schema that can fill
this gap. Our schema, which is based on discussions
with biologists, computational linguists and public
health experts, helps identify entities related to in-
fectious diseases which are then used to build up a
detailed picture of events in later stages of text min-
ing. One significant aspect of the schema is that it
is based on conceptual analysis with a formal on-
tological methodology. As discussed in (Kawazoe
et al, 2006), by applying meta-properties (Guarino
and Welty, 2000a; Guarino and Welty, 2000b), our
?markable? concepts are classified into ?Type? and
?Role?. Information about Role concepts is inte-
grated into the schema as attributes on NEs. This
work takes the investigation one step forward by
showing empirical evidence for the usefulness of
Role concepts in a practical application.
In this paper, we focus on the task of text classifi-
cation, proceeding under the simplifying assumption
that given enough annotated training data for NEs
and their Roles both can be automatically tagged
with high accuracy. In recent years there have been
many studies on text classification using general
methods (Sebastiani, 2002; Yang and Liu, 1999)
semi-structured texts (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2004),
and XML classification (Zaki and Aggarwal, 2003).
Other research has investigated the contribution of
semantic information in the form of synonyms, syn-
tax, etc. in text representation (Bloehdorn and
Hotho, 2004; Hotho et al, 2003; Fru?rnkranz et al,
1998). Feature selection (Scott and Matwin, 1999)
has also been studied. The contribution of this paper
is to provide an analysis and evaluation on the Roles
of NEs in annotated text classification.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in
Section 2, we outline the BioCaster schema for the
annotation of terms in biomedical text; Section 3
presents a description of the BioCaster gold standard
corpus; Section 4 provides details of the method
and experimental results of classification on the gold
standard corpus. Finally we draw some conclusions
in Section 5.
2 BioCaster Schema for Annotation of
Terms in Biomedical Text
The BioCaster annotation schema is a component of
the BioCaster text mining project. We have iden-
tified several important concepts that reflect infor-
mation about infectious diseases, and created guide-
lines for annotating them as target entity classes
in texts. Based on the conceptual analysis using
meta-properties (rigidity, identity, and dependency)
developed by Guarino and Welty (2000a; 2000b),
categories of important concepts were classified as
Types, i.e., properties which are rigid1 and supply
identity conditions, while others were identified as
being Roles, properties which are anti-rigid2 and
dependent. The 18 categories of Type concepts
are specified as NE classes which we denote here
in upper case. These include PERSON, LOCA-
TION, ORGANIZATION, TIME, DISEASE, CON-
DITION (status of patient such as ?hospitalized?
or ?in stable condition?), OUTBREAK (event of
group infection), VIRUS, ANATOMY (body part),
PRODUCT (biological product such as ?vaccine?),
NONHUMAN (animals), DNA, RNA, PROTEIN,
CONTROL (control measures to contain the dis-
ease), BACTERIA, CHEMICAL and SYMPTOM.
The three Role concepts we explore are case (dis-
1A property is rigid if every instance of that property neces-
sarily has the property, i.e. in every possible world.
2A property is anti-rigid if no instance of that property nec-
essarily has the property.
18
eased person), transmission (source of infection)
and therapeutic (therapeutic agent). These are inte-
grated into the annotation schema as XML attributes
which are associated with some XML elements de-
noting Type concepts. PERSON takes a case at-
tribute, NONHUMAN and ANATOMY take trans-
mission, PRODUCT takes transmission and thera-
peutic and CHEMICAL takes therapeutic. For PER-
SON we added another attribute number (number
of people). Each attribute has only one value, the
value of number is one or many, and the value of
case, transmission, therapeutic is true or false. This
is summarized in Table 1. In the rest of this paper,
we call case, transmission, and therapeutic ?Role at-
tributes? (or ?Role? for short) and number a ?Qual-
ity attributes? (or ?Quality? for short).
A NE in a biomedical text is annotated following
the BioCaster annotation schema in XML format as
follows,
<NAME cl="Named Entity"
attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2"
... </NAME>,
where "Named Entity" is one of the names for the
18 BioCaster NEs and attribute1, attribute2,
... are the names of the NE?s Role/Quality at-
tributes, "value1", "value2", ... are values cor-
responding to Role/Quality attributes. Further de-
tails of the annotation guidelines are discussed in
(Kawazoe et al, 2006).
3 BioCaster Gold Standard Data Corpus
The BioCaster gold standard corpus was collected
from Internet news and manually annotated by two
doctoral students. The annotation of a news article
proceeded as follows. Firstly, NEs are annotated fol-
lowing the BioCaster schema and guidelines. Sec-
ondly, each annotated article is manually assigned
into one of four relevancy categories: alert, publish,
check, and reject. The assignment is based on guide-
lines that we made following discussions with epi-
demiologists and a survey of World Health Organi-
zation (WHO) reports (World Health Organization,
2004). These categories are currently being used op-
erationally by the GPHIN system which is used by
the WHO and other public health agencies. Where
there were major differences of opinion in NE anno-
tation or relevancy assignment between the two an-
notators, we consulted a public health expert in order
to decide the most appropriate assignment. Finally
we had a total of 500 articles that were fully anno-
tated. While this is small compared to other data
sets in text classification, we consider that it is large
enough to obtain a preliminary indication about the
usefulness of Role attributes.
The following is an example of an annotated arti-
cle in the BioCaster gold standard corpus.

We grouped the 500 articles into 2 categories: re-
ject and relevant. The reject category corresponds
simply to articles with label reject while the relevant
category includes articles with labels alert, pub-
lish, and check. We conflated the alert, publish and
check categories because we hypothesized that dis-

would require higher level semantic knowledge such
as pathogen infectivity and previous occurrence his-
tory which is the job of the text mining system and
the end user. Finally we had a total of 269 news
articles belong to the reject category and 231 news
articles belong to the relevant category. The statis-
tical information about NEs is shown in Table 2. In
the table, ?+? stands for the frequency of NEs in the
relevant category and ?-? stands for the frequency of
NEs in the reject category.
4 Experiments
4.1 Method
We used the BioCaster gold standard corpus to in-
vestigate the effect of NE classes and their Role at-
tributes on performance of classification. In order
to avoid unnecessary data, we removed the first line
containing DOC tag of all article in the corpus. The
validation is as follows. We randomly divided the
data set into 10 parts. Each of the first 9 parts has 23
articles belonging to the relevant category and 27 ar-
ticles belonging to the reject category; the 10th part
has 24 articles belonging to the relevant and 26 arti-
cles belonging to the reject categories. Then, we im-
plemented 10-fold cross validation: 9 parts for train-
ing and 1 part for testing sets. For the training set we
extracted NEs classes and their Roles as features to
build a classifier. The remaining part was used for
testing.
The classifier we use in this paper is the standard
Na?ive Bayes classifier (Mitchell, 1997). In the pre-
processing we did not use a stop list and no word
stemming. The experiments were implemented in
Linux OS, using the Bow toolkit (McCallum, 1996).
The details of extracting NEs and their Roles
from annotated texts are the followings. For the
sake of convenience, we divided features into 3
groups: Features for each NE, features for NEs with
Role/Quality, and features for combined NEs with
Role/Quality.
1. Features for each NE: Each NE is extracted and
used with raw text as features. We denoted NE1
as features extracted from named entity NE1.
For example, DISEASE1 means features are
raw text and DISEASE class, VIRUS1 means
features are raw text and VIRUS class. An ex-
ample of features for PERSON1 is shown in
Table 3.
2. Features for NEs with Role/Quality: We inves-
tigated the effect of NEs with Roles/Qualities,
i.e., case, number, therapeutic, and transmis-
sion. Features are chosen as follows.
- PERSON+case+number: Raw text and
PERSON class with both Role case and
Quality number are used as features.
- PERSON+case: Raw text and PERSON
class with Role case are used as features.
- PERSON+number: Raw text and PER-
SON class and Quality number are used
as features.
- NONHUMAN+trans: Raw text and
NONHUMAN class and Role transmis-
sion are used as features.
- ANATOMY+trans: Raw text and
ANATOMY class and Role transmission
are used as features.

3. Features for combined NEs with Roles. We
investigate features for disease-related NEs
which include DISEASE, VIRUS, BACTE-
RIA, SYMPTOM, CONDITION, CONTROL,
DNA, PROTEIN, RNA, OUTBREAK, PROD-
UCT, ANATOMY, NONHUMAN, CHEMI-
CAL and features for all NEs with their Roles,
i.e., therapeutic and transmission. We investi-
gated 5 different features as follows:
- Text only: Only raw text is used as fea-
tures.
- Text+DiseaseNEs: Raw text and all 14
NEs disease-related classes are used as
features.
- Text+DiseaseNEs+Roles: Raw text and
all 14 NEs disease-related classes with
Roles are used as features. We note that
there are two Roles therapeutic and trans-
mission in this case.
- Text+AllNEs: Raw text and all NE classes
are used as features.
- Text+AllNEs+Roles: Raw text and all NE
classes with Roles are used as features. In
this case we have all 3 Roles case, thera-
peutic and transmission.

4.2 Results and Discussions
The details of experimental results are shown in the
following sections. We use two performance mea-
sures, standard Precision/Recall and accuracy. They
are calculated based on the two-way contingency ta-
ble in Table 4. In the table, a counts the assigned
and correct cases, b counts the assigned and incor-
rect cases, c counts the not assigned but incorrect
cases, and d counts the not assigned and correct
cases (Yang, 1999). Then,
Precision = aa + b , and Recall =
a
a + c .
Accuracy is defined as accuracy=(a + d)/(a + b +
c + d).
4.2.1 Effectiveness of Each NE Class
In order to investigate the effect of NEs on per-
formance, we consider the baseline as the method
using text only. In experiment the baseline achieved
a performance of 74.40% accuracy and 64.35% Pre-
cision, 100% Recall. We can see that Recall always
achieves 100% in all cases. This may be due to the
small size of data. However it is interesting that we
can observe the change of Precision measure - an
important measure in our case. Hereafter we discuss
accuracy and Precision only.
The effectiveness of each NE class is shown in Ta-
ble 5. The results show that each NE does not have
the same effect. Compared to the baseline, nearly
half the total NEs (7/18) help improve performance
while the others do not have a significant affect.
Looking at the distribution of NE frequency in Ta-
ble 2, it seems that the higher the frequency of the
NE class, the better the performance it provides. For
example, PERSON achieved the best of all (76.80%
accuracy, 66.57% Precision compared to 74.40% ac-
curacy and 64.35% Precision when using raw text).
However this trend is not always followed, for ex-
ample, the TIME class tends to reduce performance
when compared to raw text. This is natural as there
is no obvious correlation between time and rele-
vancy. From the result tables we can conclude that
the effectiveness of each NE on the performance of
classification in our corpus is decreased in the fol-
lowing order.
PERSON > LOCATION > ORGANIZATION >
DISEASE > CONDITION = VIRUS = OUT-
BREAK > NONHUMAN = ANATOMY = SYMP-
TOM = CONTROL = BACTERIA = PRODUCT =
PROTEIN > CHEMICAL = DNA = RNA > TIME
In particular, 7 NEs, i.e., PERSON, LO-
CATION, ORGANIZATION, DISEASE, CONDI-
TION, VIRUS, OUTBREAK improve performance,
while TIME significantly reduces it. Two NEs DNA
and RNA that have low frequency weakly reduce
performance.
4.2.2 Effectiveness of Roles on Classification
In this Section we investigate the effect of each
Role on performance. The experimental results are
shown in Table 6. We can easily observe that Roles
in NEs improved both the accuracy and Precision
significantly.
We first consider the Role case. This Role is as-
sociated to PERSON which has highest frequency
in the corpus. Role case helped improve the ac-
curacy from 76.8% to 80.60%, and Precision from
66.57% to 74.43% for PERSON. This is significant
when we compare to the baseline with 74.4% ac-
curacy and 64.35% Precision. We note that PER-
SON has another attribute, the Quality number. Role
case helps PERSON with Quality number improve
the accuracy from 78.00% to 81.80% and Precision
from 67.74% to 71.74%. Moreover, we can obvi-
ously draw the relative comparison about effective-
ness between Role case and Quality number from
these results, it yields that case > number.
We proceed to investigate the effect of Roles ther-
apeutic and transmission. Obviously we see that
their effects on performance are positive. Specifi-
cally, transmission help NONHUMAN improve the
accuracy from 74.40% to 74.60%, therapeutic helps
CHEMICAL improve the accuracy from 74.20% to
74.40%. They both have not effects on some mi-
nor NE classes like ANATOMY and PRODUCT. If
we had more training data with more of these mi-
nor NE classes we hope to see a positive effect from

Roles on them. Interestingly, while NEs associated
to Roles do not improve the accuracy like NONHU-
MAN and CHEMICAL, their Roles helped improve
the accuracy. Based on the improvements of trans-
mission and therapeutic in Table 6, we can draw
their effectiveness are the same on their NEs, that
is therapeutic = transmission.
When we compare the effect of all Roles on per-
formance, we can see that the improvements of Role
case and also Quality number are much higher than
the improvements of Roles therapeutic and trans-
mission. We think this is because the frequency of
PERSON (NE associated to Role case and Quality
number) is higher than the frequency of NEs which

4.2.3 Effectiveness of Combined NEs with
Roles
We continue to investigate the effectiveness of
Roles for combined NEs. The experimental re-
sults are given in Table 7. We note that there are
two Roles therapeutic and transmission in disease-
related NE classes, and all 3 Roles case, therapeutic
and transmission in all NE classes.
We can easily see that Roles improved perfor-
mance of text classification significantly. In de-
tails, for disease-related NE classes, Roles thera-
peutic and transmission helped to improve the ac-
curacy from 74.40% to 76.20%, and Precision from
64.35% to 66.% compared to the baseline. For all
NE classes, all 3 Roles case, therapeutic, and trans-
mission help to improve the accuracy from 74.40%
to 84.40% and Precision from 64.35% to 74.76%.
We conclude that all 3 Roles achieved the best re-
sults in performance.

5 Conclusion
This paper has focused on the contribution of Roles
in biomedical annotated text classification. The ex-
perimental results indicated that:
1. Roles of each NE greatly help improve perfor-
mance of the system.
2. The effect of Role/Quality attributes on classi-
fication was decreased in the order as follows:
case > number > therapeutic = transmission.
3. Combined NE classes with Roles contribute
significantly to the improvement of perfor-
mance.
