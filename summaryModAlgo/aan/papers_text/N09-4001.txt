Overview?
This?half?day?tutorial?introduces?participants?to?data?intensive?text?processing?with?the?MapReduce?
programming?model?[1],?using?the?open?source?Hadoop?implementation.?The?focus?will?be?on?scalability?
and?the?tradeoffs?associated?with?distributed?processing?of?large?datasets.?Content?will?include?general?
discussions?about?algorithm?design,?presentation?of?illustrative?algorithms,?case?studies?in?HLT?
applications,?as?well?as?practical?advice?in?writing?Hadoop?programs?and?running?Hadoop?clusters.?
Amazon?has?generously?agreed?to?provide?each?participant?with?$100?in?Amazon?Web?Services?(AWS)?
credits?that?can?used?toward?its?Elastic?Compute?Cloud?(EC2)??utility?computing??service?(sufficient?for?
1000?instance?hours).?EC2?allows?anyone?to?rapidly?provision?Hadoop?clusters??on?the?fly??without?
upfront?hardware?investments,?and?provides?a?low?cost?vehicle?for?exploring?Hadoop.?
Intended?Audience?
The?tutorial?is?targeted?at?any?NLP?researcher?interested?in?data?intensive?processing?and?scalability?
issues?in?general.?No?background?in?parallel?or?distributed?computing?is?necessary,?but?a?prior?knowledge?
of?HLT?is?assumed.?
Course?Objectives?

approaches?to?concurrent?programming.?
? Acquire?understanding?of?how?data?intensive?HLT?problems?(e.g.,?text?retrieval,?iterative?
optimization?problems,?etc.)?can?be?solved?using?MapReduce.?
? Acquire?understanding?of?the?tradeoffs?involved?in?designing?MapReduce?algorithms?and?
awareness?of?associated?engineering?issues.?
