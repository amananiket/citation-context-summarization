Abstract
The Document Understanding Conference
(DUC) 2005 evaluation had a single user-
oriented, question-focused summarization
task, which was to synthesize from a set
of 25-50 documents a well-organized, flu-
ent answer to a complex question. The
evaluation shows that the best summariza-
tion systems have difficulty extracting rel-
evant sentences in response to complex
questions (as opposed to representative
sentences that might be appropriate to a
generic summary). The relatively gener-
ous allowance of 250 words for each an-
swer also reveals how difficult it is for
current summarization systems to produce
fluent text from multiple documents.
1 Introduction
The Document Understanding Conference (DUC)
is a series of evaluations of automatic text sum-
marization systems. It is organized by the Na-
tional Institute of Standards of Technology with
the goals of furthering progress in automatic sum-
marization and enabling researchers to participate
in large-scale experiments.
In DUC 2001-2004 a growing number of
research groups participated in the evaluation
of generic and focused summaries of English
newspaper and newswire data. Various target
sizes were used (10-400 words) and both single-
document summaries and summaries of multiple
documents were evaluated (around 10 documents
per set). Summaries were manually judged for
both content and readability. To evaluate content,
each peer (human or automatic) summary was
compared against a single model (human) sum-
mary using SEE (http://www.isi.edu/ cyl/SEE/)
to estimate the percentage of information in the
model that was covered in the peer. Addition-
ally, automatic evaluation of content coverage us-
ing ROUGE (Lin, 2004) was explored in 2004.
Human summaries vary in both writing style
and content. For example, (Harman and Over,
2004) noted that a human summary can vary in its
level of granularity, whether the summary has a
very high-level analysis or primarily contains de-
tails. They analyzed the effects of human vari-
aion in the DUC evaluations and concluded that
despite large variation in model summaries, the
rankings of the systems when compared against a
single model for each document set remained sta-
ble when averaged over a large number of docu-
ment sets and human assessors. The use of a large
test set to smooth over natural human variation is
not a new technique; it is the approach that has
been taken in TREC (Text Retrieval Conference)
for many years (Voorhees and Buckley, 2002).
While evaluators can achieve stable overall sys-
tem rankings by averaging scores over a large
number of document sets, system builders are still
faced with the challenge of producing a summary
for a given document set that is most likely to
satisfy any human user (since they cannot know
ahead of time which human will be using or judg-
ing the summary). Thus, system developers desire
an evaluation methodology that takes into account
human variation in summaries for any given doc-
ument set.
DUC 2005 marked a major change in direc-
tion from previous years. The road mapping com-
mittee had strongly recommended that new tasks
be undertaken that were strongly tied to a clear
user application. At the same time, the program
committee wanted to work on new evaluation
methodologies and metrics that would take into
48
account variation of content in human-authored
summaries.
Therefore, DUC 2005 had a single user-oriented
system task that allowed the community to put
some time and effort into helping with a new eval-
uation framework. The system task modeled real-
world complex question answering (Amigo et al,
2004). Systems were to synthesize from a set of
25-50 documents a brief, well-organized, fluent
answer to a need for information that could not
be met by just stating a name, date, quantity, etc.
Summaries were evaluated for both content and
readability.
The task design attempted to constrain two
parameters that could produce summaries with
widely different content: focus and granularity.
Having a question to focus the summary was in-
tended to improve agreement in content between
the model summaries. Additionally, the assessor
who developed each topic specified the desired
granularity (level of generalization) of the sum-
mary. Granularity was a way to express one type
of user preference; one user might want a general
background or overview summary, while another
user might want specific details that would allow
him to answer questions about specific events or
situations.
Because it is both impossible and unnatural to
eliminate all human variation, our assessors cre-
ated as many manual summaries as feasible for
each topic, to provide examples of the range of
normal human variability in the summarization
task. These multiple models would provide more
representative training data to system developers,
while enabling additional experiments to investi-
gate the effect of human variability on the evalua-
tion of summarization systems.
As in past DUCs, assessors manually evalu-
ated each summary for readability using a set
of linguistic quality questions. Summary con-
tent was manually evaluated using the pseudo-
extrinsic measure of responsiveness, which does
not attempt pairwise comparison of peers against
a model summary but gives a coarse ranking of
all the summaries based on responsiveness of
the summary to the topic. In parallel, ISI and
Columbia University led the summarization re-
search community in two exploratory efforts at in-
trinsic evaluation of summary content; these eval-
uations compared peer summaries against multiple
reference summaries, using Basic Elements at ISI
and Pyramids at Columbia University.
This paper describes the DUC 2005 task and the
results of our evaluations of summary content and
readability. (Hovy et al, 2005) and (Passonneau
et al, 2005) provide additional details and results
of the evaluations of summary content using Basic
Elements and Pyramids.
2 Task Description
The DUC 2005 task was a complex question-
focused summarization task that required summa-
rizers to piece together information from multiple
documents to answer a question or set of questions
as posed in a topic.
Assessors developed a total of 50 topics to be
used as test data. For each topic, the assessor se-
lected 25-50 related documents from the Los An-
geles Times and Financial Times of London and
formulated a topic statement, which was a request
for information that could be answered using the
selected documents. The topic statement could be
in the form of a question or set of related questions
and could include background information that the
assessor thought would help clarify his/her infor-
mation need.
The assessor also indicated the ?granularity? of
the desired response for each topic. That is, they
indicated whether they wanted the answer to their
question(s) to name specific events, people, places,
etc., or whether they wanted a general, high-level
answer. Only one value of granularity was given
for each topic, since the goal was not to measure
the effect of different granularities on system per-
formance for a given topic, but to provide addi-
tional information about the user?s preferences to
both human and automatic summarizers.
An example DUC topic follows:
num: D345
title: American Tobacco Companies Over-
seas
narr: In the early 1990?s, American to-
bacco companies tried to expand their busi-
ness overseas. What did these companies do
or try to do and where? How did their parent
companies fare?
granularity: specific
The summarization task was the same for both
human and automatic summarizers: Given a DUC
topic with granularity specification and a set of
documents relevant to the topic, the summariza-
tion task was to create from the documents a brief,
49
well-organized, fluent summary that answers the
need for information expressed in the topic, at
the specified level of granularity. The summary
could be no longer than 250 words (whitespace-
delimited tokens). Summaries over the size limit
were truncated, and no bonus was given for cre-
ating a shorter summary. No specific format-
ting other than linear was allowed. The summary
should include (in some form or other) all the
information in the documents that contributed to
meeting the information need.
Ten assessors produced a total of 9 human sum-
maries for each of 20 topics, and 4 human sum-
maries for each of the remaining 30 topics. The
summarization task was a relatively difficult task,
requiring about 5 hours to manually create each
summary. Thus, there would be a real benefit to
users if the task could be performed automatically.
3 Participants
There was much interest in the longer, question-
focused summaries required in the DUC 2005
task. 31 participants submitted runs to the evalua-
tion; they are identified by numeric Run IDs (2-32)
in the remainder of this paper. We also developed
a simple baseline system that returned the first 250
words of the most recent document for each topic
(Run ID = 1). In addition to the automatic peers,
there were 10 human peers, assigned alphabetic
Run IDs, A-J.
Most system developers treated the summariza-
tion task as a passage retrieval task. Sentences
were ranked according to relevance to the topic.
The most relevant sentences were then selected for
inclusion in the summary while minimizing redun-
dancy within the summary, up to the maximum
250-word allowance. A significant minority of
systems first decomposed the topic narrative into
a set of simpler questions, and then extracted sen-
tences to answer each subquestion. Systems dif-
fered in the approach taken to compute relevance
and redundancy, using similarity metrics ranging
from simple term frequency to semantic graph
matching. In order to include more relevant infor-
mation in the summary, systems attempted within-
sentence compression by removing phrases such
as parentheticals and relative clauses.
Many systems simply ignored the granularity
specification. The systems that addressed gran-
ularity did so by preferring to extract sentences
that contained proper names for topics with a ?spe-
cific? granularity but not for topics with ?general?
granularity.
Cross-sentence dependencies had to be handled,
including anaphora. Strategies for dealing with
pronouns that occurred in relevant sentences in-
cluded co-reference resolution, including the pre-
vious sentence for additional context, or simply
excluding all sentences containing any pronouns.
Most systems made no attempt to reword the ex-
tracted sentences to improve the readability of the
final summary. Although some systems grouped
related sentences together to improve cohesion,
the most common heuristic to improve readabil-
ity was simply to order the extracted sentences by
document date and position in the document. Sys-
tem 12 achieved high readability scores by choos-
ing a single representative document and extract-
ing sentences in the order of appearance in that
document. This approach is similar to the base-
line summarizer and produces summaries that are
more fluent than those constructed from multiple
documents.
4 Evaluation Results
Summaries were manually evaluated by 10 asses-
sors. All summaries for a given topic were judged
by a single assessor (who was usually the same as
the topic developer). In all cases, the assessor was
one of the summarizers for the topic. All sum-
maries for the topic (including the one written by
the assessor) were anonymously presented to the
assessor, in a random order, and the ssessor judged
each summary for readability and responsiveness
to the topic, giving separate scores for responsive-
ness and each of 5 linguistic qualities. This al-
lowed participants who could not work on opti-
mizing all 6 manual scores, to focus on only the
elements that they were interested in or had the re-
sources to address.
No single score was reported that reflected a
combination of readability and content. In pre-
vious years, responsiveness considered both the
content and readability of the summary. While it
tracked SEE coverage, responsiveness could not
be seen as a direct measure of content due to pos-
sible effects of readability on the score. Because
we needed an inexpensive manual measure of cov-
erage, we revised the definition of responsiveness
in 2005 so that it considered only the information
content and not the readability of the summary, to
the extent possible.

4.1 Evaluation of Readability
The readability of the summaries was assessed us-
ing five linguistic quality questions which mea-
sured qualities of the summary that do not in-
volve comparison with a reference summary or
DUC topic. The linguistic qualities measured
were Grammaticality, Non-redundancy, Referen-
tial clarity, Focus, and Structure and coherence.
Q1: Grammaticality The summary should
have no datelines, system-internal formatting, cap-
italization errors or obviously ungrammatical sen-
tences (e.g., fragments, missing components) that
make the text difficult to read.
Q2: Non-redundancy There should be no un-
necessary repetition in the summary. Unnecessary
repetition might take the form of whole sentences
that are repeated, or repeated facts, or the repeated
use of a noun or noun phrase (e.g., ?Bill Clinton?)
when a pronoun (?he?) would suffice.
Q3: Referential clarity It should be easy to
identify who or what the pronouns and noun
phrases in the summary are referring to. If a per-
son or other entity is mentioned, it should be clear
what their role in the story is. So, a reference
would be unclear if an entity is referenced but its
identity or relation to the story remains unclear.
Q4: Focus The summary should have a focus;
sentences should only contain information that is
related to the rest of the summary.
Q5: Structure and Coherence The summary
should be well-structured and well-organized. The
summary should not just be a heap of related infor-
mation, but should build from sentence to sentence
to a coherent body of information about a topic.
Each linguistic quality question was assessed on
a five-point scale:
1. Very Poor
2. Poor
3. Barely Acceptable
4. Good
5. Very Good
Table 1 shows the distribution of the scores
across all the summaries, broken down by the type
of summarizer (Human, Baseline, or Participants).
All summarizers generally performed well on the
first two linguistic qualities. The high scores on
non-redundancy show that most participants have

successfully achieved this capability. Humans and
the baseline system also scored well on the last
3 linguistic qualities. The multi-document sum-
marization systems submitted by participants, on
the other hand, still struggle with referential clar-
ity and focus, and perform very poorly on structure
and coherence.
4.1.1 Comparison by system
For each linguistic quality question, we per-
formed a multiple comparison test between the
scores of all peers using Tukey?s honestly signif-
icant difference criterion. A multiple comparison
test between all human and automatic peers was
performed using the Kruskall-Wallis test, to see
how the individual automatic peers performed rel-
ative to human peers. For grammaticality, the best
human summarizer is significantly better than 28
of the 32 systems; the worst human summarizer
is better than 8 systems. For non-redundancy, the
two best humans are significantly better than 6 sys-
tems, and the two worst humans are not signifi-
cantly different from any system. For referential
clarity, all humans are significantly better than all
but 2 automatic peers (baseline and System 12).
For focus, the best human is significantly better
than all automatic peers except the baseline; all
other humans are significantly better than all au-
tomatic peers except the baseline and System 12.
For structure and coherence, the two best humans
are significantly better than 31 systems (all auto-
matic peers except the baseline); all humans are
better than 30 of the automatic peers (all automatic
peers except baseline and System 12).
4.2 Evaluation of Content
We performed manual pseudo-extrinsic evaluation
of peer summaries in the form of assessment of
responsiveness. Responsiveness is different from
SEE coverage in that it does not compare a peer
summary against a single reference; however, re-
sponsiveness tracked SEE coverage in DUC 2003
and 2004, and was used to provide a coarse-
grained measure of content in 2005. We also com-
puted ROUGE scores as was done in DUC 2004.
4.2.1 Responsiveness
Assessors assigned a raw responsiveness score
to each summary. The score provides a coarse
ranking of the summaries for each topic, according
to the amount of information in the summary that
helps to satisfy the information need expressed in
the topic statement, at the level of granularity re-
quested in the user profile. The score was an inte-
ger between 1 and 5, with 1 being least respon-
sive and 5 being most responsive. For a given
topic, some summary was required to receive each
of the five possible scores, but no distribution was
specified for how many summaries had to receive
each score. The number of human summaries
scored per topic also varied. Therefore, raw re-
sponsiveness scores should not be directly added
and compared across topics. Assigning respon-
siveness scores can be seen as a clustering task in
which peers are partitioned into exactly 5 clusters,
where members of a cluster are more similar to
each other in quality.

Table 2: Multiple comparison of systems based on
Friedman?s test on responsiveness
For each topic, we computed the scaled respon-
siveness score for each summary, such that the
sum of the scaled responsiveness score is propor-
tional to the number of summaries for the topic.
The scaled responsiveness is the rank of the sum-
mary based on the raw responsiveness score. We
computed the average scaled responsiveness score
of each summarizer across all topics. Since the
52
number of human summaries varied across topics,
we also computed the average scaled responsive-
ness score of only the automatic summaries (ig-
noring the human summaries in scaling respon-
siveness).
Table 2 shows the results of a multiple com-
parison of scaled responsiveness of the automatic
peers using Tukey?s honestly significant criterion
and Friedman?s test, with the best peers on top;
peers not sharing a common letter are significantly
different at the 95.5% confidence level. None of
the automatic peers performed significantly bet-
ter than the majority of the remaining peers, and
only eight of the automatic peers performed signif-
icantly better than the simple baseline. In multiple
comparison of all peers using the Kruskal-Wallis
test, all human peers were significantly better than
all the automatic peers.
4.2.2 ROUGE
We computed two ROUGE scores: ROUGE-2
and ROUGE-SU4 recall, both with stemming and
implementing jackknifing for each [peer, topic]
pair so that human and automatic peers could be
compared. Since the number of ROUGE evalu-
ations per topic varied depending on the number
of reference summaries, we computed a macro-
average of each score for each peer, where the
macro-average score is the mean over all topics of
the mean per-topic score for the peer.
Unlike responsiveness and linguistic quality
scores, which are ordinal data and are best suited
for non-parametric analyses, ROUGE scores, can
be measured on an interval scale and are suit-
able for parametric analysis. Analysis of variance
showed significant effects from peer and topic
(p = 0 for each factor) for both ROUGE-2 and
ROUGE-SU4 recall. To see which peers were
different, a multiple comparison of population
marginal means (PMM) was performed for each
type of ROUGE score. The population marginal
means remove any effect of an unbalanced design
(since not all human peers created summaries for
all topics) by fixing the values of the ?peer? factor,
and averaging out the effects of the ?topic? factor
as if each factor combination occurred the same
number of times.
Table 3 shows multiple comparison of all peers
based on ANOVA of ROUGE-2 recall (ROUGE-
SU4 shows similar results). ROUGE-2 and
ROUGE-SU4 both distinguish human peers from
automatic ones. The difference in the ROUGE-2

score of the best system and worst human is not
considered significant (possibly due to the very
conservative nature of the multiple comparison
test) but is still relatively large. On the other
hand, ANOVA of ROUGE-2 found more signifi-
cant differences between the automatic peers than
did Friedman?s test of responsiveness.
4.3 Correlation
A metric must produce stable rankings of systems
in the face of human variation. Intrinsic measures
like ROUGE rely on multiple model summaries to
take into account human variation (although Pyra-
mids add another level of human variation in the
manual pyramid and peer annotation). For a met-
ric like responsiveness, which does not depend on
comparison of peer summaries against a model or
set of model summaries, it is appropriate to con-
sider the stability of the measure across different
assessors.
A secondary assessment was done on respon-
siveness for the 20 topics that had 9 summaries
each. The secondary assessor had written a sum-
mary for the topic but was generally not the same
person who developed the topic. As seen in Figure
1, average scaled responsiveness scores from the
two sets of assessments (averaged over the 20 top-
ics) track each other very well. The human sum-
maries are clustered on the upper right side of the
graph, while the automatic summaries form a sec-
ond cluster on the lower left side.
The actual responsiveness scores for each sys-
tem and each topic do vary between assessors, but
this variation in human judgment is smoothed out
by averaging over multiple topics. Table 4 shows
that the correlation between the primary and sec-

5 Conclusion
The DUC 2005 task was to summarize the answer
to a complex question, as found in a set of docu-
ments. The evaluation showed that only the top
systems are able to extract sentences whose in-
formation content is more responsive to the ques-
tion than a simple baseline. Additionally, systems
require much additional work to produce coher-
ent, well-structured text, which is apparent in the
longer summary sizes of DUC 2005. On the other
hand, systems do well on non-redundancy, since
text summarization has historically been formu-
lated as a text compression task. Since DUC 2005
is the first time question-focused summarization
has been evaluated on a large-scale, we have re-
peated the task in 2006, with some modifications.
We eliminated the ?granularity? specification in
DUC 2006. Assessors had appreciated the theory
behind the granularity specification, but found that
the size limit for the summaries was a much big-
ger factor in determining what information to in-
clude; some ?specific? summaries ended up being
very general given the large amount of informa-
tion and limited space allowed. From a human
perspective, the actual granularity of the resulting
summary mostly fell out naturally from the topic
question and the content that was available in the
source documents.
The definition of responsiveness scores was
meant to yield a coarse ranking of the peer sum-
maries into 5 ordered clusters. However, asses-
sors found it difficult to form these 5 clusters be-
cause of the large number (36+) of summaries that
needed to be compared with one another, and the
impression that many sets of human and automatic
summaries could not be separated into as many
as 5 groups. We therefore changed the scoring
of responsiveness in 2006 so that it is based on
the same scale as the linguistic quality questions;
this may reduce the discriminative power of the
responsiveness measure but should produce scores
that more accurately reflect the true differences be-
tween summaries.
