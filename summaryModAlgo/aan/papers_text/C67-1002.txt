The machine t rans la t ion  pro jec t  a t  the Nat iona l  Phys ica l  
Laboratory  (NFL) has b?en terminated.  I t  has always ha~ as i t s  
prime aim a demonst ra t~n of the pract i cab i l i ty  o f  t rans la t ion  by 
computer of  Russian sc ient i f i c  texts  into En@lish. In  order  to 
tes t  how fa r  th i s  aim has been fu l f i l l ed  and fu r ther ,  to prov ide 
evidence to 6~i~e a potent ia l  agency in teres te~ in  givin~ a machine 
t rans la t ion  serv ice ,  we he .car r ied  out an eva luat ion  experiment 
on our translations, the conditions of which as far as possible 
emulated those of a translations service. 
The resu l t s  of th i s  experiment are presented in th i s  paper ,  
together  with a statuary of the t rans la t ion  methods used. The 
paper as a whole will thus give an independent presentation of "what 
methods produced what results". For a comprehensive account of the 
NFL translation techniques, see reference I. 
Evaluation of Translations 
We have been concerned with the translation of scientific 
Russian texts only. In considering how we might evaluate the 
results of our work, the context of use of scientific translations 
imposed two main constraints. Thus, firstly, in the vast m~jority 
of cases we woul~ expect readers of translations to be themselves 
experts in the subject matter of the material translated, i.e. they 
would be reading the translations because these reflect their main 
professional responsibilities. We may then expect that the inherent 
background knowledge of such readers will ensure a hiKh impetus to 
their comprehension of translations and help them through syntactic 
awkwardnesses and multiple-meshing choices. We would also expect 
that only a small peroenta6e of these readers would have any 
competence in Russian. Secondly, the items of translation being 
read by the above typical readers will normally be whole infor.~tion 
units (journal article, chapter of book, abstract, review, &c.), and 
they will have the freedom to ignore unimportant sections of such 
units an& to use sentence or paragraph context (or even remoter 
references) to help elucidate obscure sections. More specifically, 
a particular sentence may be poorly translate~, but because the 
reader can see that this is not an important sentence or because 
the context of (hopefUlly, better-translated) neighbourin6 sentences 
clarifies its meaning, that sentence may not affect at all an 
adequate comprehension of the whole. 
Both these const ra in ts  are re f lec ted  in our eva luat ion  
experiment.  We ensured that  our eva luators  were expert  in  the 
- I  - 
f i e ld  of  the mater ia l  they were eva luat ing ,  and a l so  that  they 
commented on the adequacy of an in format ion  uni t  as a whole, not 
on ind iv idua l  sentences .  
We have inc luded in  th i s  paper (F I~.  2(A)) a shor t  passage 
from one of the eva luated  t rans la t ions ,  as the fu l l  t rans la t ion  i s  
inappropr ia te  fo r  th i s  p r in ted  vers ion .  However, the fu l l  
t rans la t ion  w i l l  be ava i lab le  fo r  inspect ion  a t  the presentat ion  
of  the paper, or  the fu l l  t rans la t ion  of  another  paper can be 
examined in  re ference  1, 
The eva luat ion  experiment 
In  o rder  to  fu l f i l  the f i r s t  const ra in t  above, we inv i ted  
pract i s ing  sc ient i s ts  to send in  Russian papers ,  re f lec t i~  the i r  
p ro fess iona l  spec ia l i ty  and pre ferab ly  in  the f ie lds  of genera l  
phys ics ,  e lec t ron ics ,  or  e lec t r i ca l  eng ineer ing .  Some papers 
resu l ted  from d i rec t  inv i ta t ion ,  o thers  resu l ted  from an open 
inv i ta t ion  pub l i shed in  our house journa l ,  "NFL Quar ter ly" .  We 
undertook to send them the machine t rans la t ions  of  the i r  papers in  
re turn  fo r  the i r  comments on how usefu l  the resu l t s  were. We a lso  
obta ined  second opinions from other  spec ia l i s ts  in  the sub jec ts  
COnc er l le~ 
These evaluators were therefore as far as possible typical 
of the "customers" of a production MT service; in particular they 
had a personal interest in the subject matter and usually little 
if any knowledge of Russian. 
In all ~O+ papers were received in responce to our invitation; 
of these 28 were transl~ted in full I . 3even of these were dis- 
regarded for various reasonc 2, and the remaining 21 were included 
in  the eva luat ion .  
38 comments were received on 19 of these 21 papers. Of these 
two were rejected for vagueness, az~ three brief comments from one 
group were treated as one, so in all the experiment produced 3@ 
comments on 19 papers. 
1The other  t6 are  accounted fo r  as fo l lows:  I was on a remote 
subject; 2 were deferred since we had already translated three 
papers for the same 'customer'; @ were withdrawn; 3 were 
translated only in part; and 6 were not reached by the date our 
computer was sorapped~ 
23 were on inappropr ia te  sub jec ts ;

-2 -  
We had decided to give our evaluators a free han~ in dis- 
cussing the usefulness to them of translations of this quality. 
This meant that a scale had to be devised by which their comments 
could then be graded by us. A scale recently published in the 
U.S.A. (reference 2) was considered but not adopted since we felt 
that for our purposes more space should be given to the middle 
range of the scale. The following wording was adopted~ 
Fully adequate. Meaning immediately clear, even though 
not always conventionally expressed. 
Mostly very good. A few sentences obscure, so that some- 
thing essential may be lost, but normally clear enough. 
Fa i r .  Takes a good deal  of t ime to ext rac t  meaning and 
even then there  i s  no great  conf idence in  i t ,  resu l t ing  in  a 
partial understanding. 
Poor.  Could only be use fu l  to  someone prepared  to s t rugg le  
hard, and even he would o f ten  be d i sappo inted .  
Useless. Although some semblance of meaning may appear 
occasionally, it would never be worth the trouble of finding 
it. 
The wording of this scale is not derived on ar~ scientific basis, 
but it has proved useful in practice, since when four of us came 
to grade the comments by it independently, there was a good agree- 
ment between our markings. Our four individual ratings for each 
comment were reduced to a single rating (normally the mean) after 
discussion. The range of scores is shown in FIG. I ; the mean 
score is 5.6. 
The spread i s  no doubt due to  a rea l  var ia t ion  in  the qua l i ty  
of the t rans la t ions  combined with the pre jud ices  and degrees of 
patience of the evaluators. The lowest scores thus come from 
impatient professional translators dealing with a poorer-than- 
average text, while the highest ones are perhaps over-enthusiastic 
supporters dealing with a better-than-average text. 
The consensus though, is that there is a real demand for 
translations of this quality, and this result provides, we feel, 
ample justification for mounting a broader evaluation exercise, 
over a wider range of potential readers of such translations, to 
strengthen, if possible, this verdict and make it possible to

Evaluators ' _ criticisms 
Apart from the opinions as to the general usefulness of  
t rans la t ion ,  eva luaters '  'comments contained ma~y par t i cu la r  po ints  
of  c r i t i c i sm which ~eserve discuss ion.  We are able to comment 
ourselves on some of these points from the pos i t ion  of  having 
done considerable aevelopment work, jus t  short of fu l l  imple- 
mentation, on techniques designed to overcome the par t i cu la r  
t rans la t ion  fau l t s .  Yul l  deta i ls  of th i s  fu r ther  work are given 
in  reference 1, an& spec i f i c  points of  re ference are given below. 
Most of these criticisms can be classified into three groups, 
concerning respectively: (i) the English equivalents offere~ 
(ii) the syntactic resolution and (iii) the wor@ order. 
A frequent criticism concerned missing or inappropriate 
equivalents. In addition to fully justified remarks of this 
kind there were also cases in which the meaning proposed, or pre- 
ferre~ by the rea~er, was uncommon. Its absence from the 
dictionary was the result of a preferential choice having been 
made, a compromise between completeness and simplicity. The other 
alternative, including all possible equivalents, would of course 
drastically impair readability. The particular solution is often 
very difficult and can only be achieved to a satisfactory degree 
after lon~ experience. 
In other oases there is no obvious preference an& the problem 
is further aggravated by the very high frequency of occurrence of 
the word. Here belong some special classes, for example all 
prepositions and some very common words such as w , a , an~ 
~ro . Prepositions can and should be resolved by considering 
them together with either the governin~ word or the governed com- 
plemsnt (nominal or otherwise)1. (For example, yBe~T~. .  ~a..,  
' to increase .... by .... ' ). For the awkward common words 
specific syntactic sub-routines should be devised~ in practical~y 
all cases the solution is unique (see reference ~). 
Only two evaluators complained about the necess i ty  of  
se lec t ion  among two or three equiva lents .  This is a matter of 
preference, but it seems to us that for a bona lids reader an 
additional possibility of meaning (if it is not carried too far) 
is more an asset than a disadvantage, even if it impairs to some

summary of  methods.

extent  smooth reading I . Unt i l  a semantic ana lys is  can be 
achieved, mult ip le equivalents are bound to stay in  M~. 
A minor point ,  but  nevertheless worth a t tent ion ,  was to the 
e f fec t  that  when mult ip le equivalents fol lowed each other ,  the 
d i f f i cu l ty  in  understanding increased out of  proport ion.  For 
example, c~yqaeTcN nt~ appears as: 'occurs  in  ' when the 
resu l t s  with 
actual meaning is often 'results in'. This was undoubtedly a 
real problem, which could perhaps be helped by using a longer 
space between sets of multiple equivalents in the output. 
Complaints concerning un-idiomatic translations (e.g. 'period 
of work' instead of ' life-time' ) would be allayed by more work 
spent on our idiom list, which contained only about 5@0 items, 
whereas 1,500 would be a more realistic figure. 
Complaints about inadequate syntactic analysis, leadimg to 
obscurities, ambiguities, and wrong resolutions, would have been 
considerably reduce& by a full implementation of the syntactic 
routines described in reference I. One of the minor but 
annoying ambiguities, which ha~ been resolved theoretically, but 
only partially implemented, was that of adver~short adjective. 
Order of clause components was a frequent subject of criticism; 
of course they can be re-arranged according to the English usage 
only after a complete analysis has been made. 
Among other things criticized was an inadequate treatment 
of abbreviations and abbreviated units, some of which were cover@d 
by dictionary entries, while others were not, and this led to some 
misunderstandiu~s. Obviously this again is a matter for a more 
complete dictionary'. The most difficult case is "nonce" 
abbreviations (we met, for instance, He~Tp. for He~TpO~HN~ 
and produced 'non-itr.', which helped no one') Here we see no 
prospect of a solution. 
Our "anglicizing" routine was criticized (while appreciating 
the general idea) for unorthodox transliteration, which made it 
more difficult to identify the word in a standard dictionary, if 
necessary3. A partial solution may be to exclude certain word

fault.

abbreviated unit ("volt"), without a special syntactic sub- 
routine.

c lasses ,  e .g .  acror~ymic abbrev ia t ions ,  which are obv ious ly  not 
suitable objects for the routine (they can be automatically 
reoo~xized as clusters of capital letters).  Also, in our 
pre f ix - recogn iz ing  rout ine  there  i s  an inherent  &anger that  a 
"not - in -d ic t ionary"  word may have a par t  of the stem ident ica l  
with an accepted pre f ix .  This app l ies  in  par t i cu la r  to  shor t  
p re f ixes ,  l i ke  He- ,  in  the above example of He~Tp. .  There i s  
no genera l  way of  deal ing with such words. The best  so lu t ion ,  
in  respect  of  both rout ines ,  seems to be,  however, to  inc lude in  
the output both the or ig ina l  ( in  Cyr i l l i c ,  i f  poss ib le )  and the 
synthet ic  equ iva lent  fo r  a l l  "not - in -d ic t ionary"  words. 
A few comments contained bouquets rather than brickbats. 
One evaluator commented that the translation became easier to 
read as he got used to the unusual 'style'; and another found 
an instance where a slip in the published human translation had 
reversed the intended meaning; our version of the passag~while 
not perfect by ar~ means, was certainly not misleading in this 
way. 
F ina l ly ,  severa l  eva luators  commented that  machine t rans -  
la t ions  would need to show advantages in  cost  and speed over 
human t rans la t ions  in  o rder  fo r  them to be a t t rac t ive  as wel l  as 
acceptab le ,  and these  are indeed c r i te r ia  that  we would ourse lves  
put forward without  fear  of  cont rad ic t ion .  V~e have not inc luded 
a s tuds  of cos t  and speed w i th in  th i s  eva luat ion  experiment,  as 
we do not have the market data  to prepare a t rans la t ion  serv ice  
spec i f i ca t ion  that  we could then re fer  such a study to .  However 
i t  i s  ev ident  that  our machine equ iva lent  of the human t rans la tor  
i.e. input punchin~ machiue translation and output printing 
~ i th  no humanpost-editor) will show a clear advantage on both 
these points. It would be essential to fit this component, 
though, into an overall translation system which was specified 
carefully to fit the translation market. 
In Yl@. 2(A) is shown a facsimile of a short passage of our 
machine translation into English of a Russian text on electric 
furnaces, completely non-post-edited. The vertical lists of two 
or three words are to be read a~ alternative English correspondents 
for the Russian word in that position. FI~ 2(B) is a facsimile of

basis, in which each entry contains a Russian stem together 
with a coded list of suffixes which can combine with the stem. 
This gave far fewer entries than would have been found in a full- 
form dictionary covering the same words. Each entry contains 
grammatical ~ata and English equivalents of the Rus~ian~ 
The stem and suffix organisation ~eman&e~ that we create a 
system of splitting Russian words consistently into stem an~ 
suffix, fully dssoribed in Davies & Day, (1961). The split is 
made at the point determined by the maximum number of letters 
which together form a Russian suffix or string of suffixes. 
The maximum split technique sometimes causes too mar~ letters 
to be treated as part of the suffix, in other words, the split 
is made too early in the worm. Such words are provided with a 
cress-reference dictionary entry which directs the search to an 
entry in which the full information for the word is contained~ 
The dictionary is recorded on two reels of ma6netio tape, 
theentries being arra~6e& in alphabetical ordsr. Time of 
consultation of the full d/otionary is from 12 minutes upwards, 
depending on the number of entries being sought. 
A text  fo r  t rans la t ion  is  f i r s t  punched on cards by an 
operator  who reco~mizes Cyr i l l i c  characters ,  though she cannot 
read Russian. Symbols, punctuation marks and Cyr i l l i c  
characters  are represented by one card column per character .  
Provision is made for indloatin 6. a space to be lef~ in the text 
where an equation or group of symbols occurs. These will be 
inserted in the translation by han~. The cards are treated as 
a continuous medium, card boundaries being ignored,. By this 
means quite a long paper can he encoded on a relatively small 
number of punohed cards. 
The text ,  now on cards,  is  fed into the computer. The 
f i r s t  computing process gives a ser ia l  number to each text  word 
and then sp l i t s  the word into stem and su f f i x .  When a l l  text  
words have been subjected to th is  process,  they are then sor ted 
in to  a lphabet ica l  order.  This is  essent ia l  fo r  optimum speed 
of  look-up in our ser ia l l y  organised d ic t ionary .  
The next programme in the t rans la t ion  sequence, the look -  
up programme, scans s imultaneously through the d ic t ionary  and 
the sorted text ,  seeking d ic t ionary  ent r ies  corresponding to the 
text  words. The programme allows fo r  the occurrence of stem 
homographs and for  the cor rec t  handling of c ross - re ference  
ent r ies .  The output of the programme (which we ca l l ,  fo l lowing 
Harvard, the augmented text )  cons is ts  of the text  words each 
with the relevant dictionary entries appended. 
Having obtained a set of augmented text entries, the 
translation sequence then sorts these back to text order, using 
the text serial number originally allocated to each text wor~ 
- t0  - 
The result of this series of operations is a text in the 
original ordsrj with dictionary entries appended to all but a 
few of the items. Symbols and punctuation marks do not, of 
course, have corresponding d ic t ionary  ent r ies ,  and there may 
be words in the text  which are not represented in  the computer 
d ic t ionary .  The la t te r  are given specia l  treatment in the 
syntact i c  rout ines and t rans la t ion  output.  
Provision is made in the dictionary for the representation 
of idioms, using a m~thod analogous to that used in an ord inary 
d ic t ionary .  A "key word" is  chosen in the idiom (normally the 
least frequently occurrin6 wor~), the idiom being represented 
in the dictionary entry of the key word. The representation 
includes a list of the component words of the idiom, using which 
the presence of an id iomatic text  word sequence can be detected 
before attemptin~ any syntact ic  operat ions on the augmented text .  
The d ic t ionary  entry  including the idiom contains the pre fer red  
Engl ish equiva lent .  The d ic t ionary  includes coding fo r  5A0 
idioms. 
Words not represented in the d ic t ionary  are given spec ia l  
t reatment,  as mentioned above. Al l  tex t  words which commence 
with one of  a set of 137 Russian pref ixes  are looked up both 
with and without p re f ix .  I f  the pref ixed form does not occur 
in  the d /ct ionar~,  but the unpref ixed form is  found, then the 
entry  fo r  the uupref ixed form is included in the augmented text ,  
coupled with an En61ish rendering of the Russian prefix. Despite 
this provision, some text words will not intersect with the 
d ic t ionary .  For these an attempt is  made to determine part  of  
speech, case, number, e tc . ,  by an inspect ion of  grammatical and 
der ivat iona l  su f f i xes .  In  the t rans la t ion  output the stem of 
the not - in -d ic t ionary  word is t rans l i te ra ted ,  aJuain6 to ang l i c i ze  
as far as possible the original word. A derivations/ suffix 
is given its English equivalent in the output rendering; any 
prefix that was recognised is also given its English rendering. 
Yrom an augmented text  produced by the foregoing procedures 
i t  would be a simple mechanical process to achieve a word- for -  
word " t rans la t ion" .  We fe l t  th is  was not worthwhile, as the 
application of relatively simple rules of grammar and syntax 
greatly enhance intelligibility of such a product. 
Russian Analysis Algorithm 
In  the f i r s t  place we designed and implemented a system of 
noun blocking and a simple predicate ana lys is .  The resu l t s  
obtained were not by any means idea l ,  but we were encouraged to 
extend and re f ine  our syntact i c  processes.  In  our f i r s t  
attempt the funct ions  of  Russian ana lys is  and Engl ish synthesis  
were c lose ly  interwoven. As our syntact i c  procedures were 
extended to cover more features  i t  became evident that  i t  was 
essent ia l  to separate the funct ions of analys is  and synthes is .  
In  order to make th is  possible the l ingu is t i c  model, descr ibed 
-11-  
in  Yates ( th i s  conference)  was developed. The mo~el Permits the 
ana lys i s  rout ines  to express the Russ ian  syntax as fa r  as 
necessary  and fac i l i ta tes  a t rans format ion  to  the oorrespondtr~ 
En61ish sentence s t ruc ture .  
The ana lys i s  rout ines  operate  in  a success ion c f  passes 
through each sentence,  def ined by major punctuat ion mark 
boundar ies  ( fu l l  s top,  quest ion mark and s'emi-c01o~ 
The funct ions  of  the success ive  ~sses  are as fo l lows:  
1. A pre l iminary  pass which es tab l i shes  from the augmented 
text  the' te rmina l  element fo r  each d i sc re te  member of  the 
sentence.  Punctuat ion marks a re  ind icated  in  the  elements 
fo r  preceding or fp l lowing sentence . i tems , ~ccording to a 
set  o f  formal ru les  . . . .  " 
2* A pass whose prime concern i s  the determinat ion of nominal 
s t ruc tures ,  i .e .  nouns and words with which they are  c lose ly  
connected, such as ad jec t ives  or  p repos i t ions .  
3. A pass which es tab l i shes  l inks  betwe'en ad jacent  n~minal 
s t ruc tures ;  the l inked  elements include gen i t ive  qua l i f i e rs  
and prepos i t iona l  group qua l i f i e rs .  
~? A pass which searches for" potent ia l  coord inat ing conjunct ions 
and examines the sentence lements  or  s t ruot twes  separate~ 
by such con junct ions ,  se t t ing  up coor~tuAte ~roups where

fo r  words with a verb ro le  andl then locat in6  adjacent  
sentence elements or  s t ruc tures"  act in~ as verb a~unctso  
6. A pass whose funct ion  i s  to examine the ro le  of some of  the 
more "d i f f i cu l t "  words such as the verb 611T~ and i t s  
in f lec ted  forms, a~d the persona~/possess ive  pronouns ere ,

A fu l l  descr ip t ion  of  these  ana lys i s  rout ines  is  g iven in  
re ference 1. In  the present  paper we sha l l  take a Russian sen-  
tence and note the e f fec t  of each ana lys i s  pass on i t .  
The Russian sentence reads:

The f i r s t  ana~s is  pass i s  not o f  par t i cu la r  in teres t  in  the 
present  context .  Su f f i ce  i t  to say that  a system of re ference  
addresses i s  se t  up which permits  the scannin6 o? the sentence

One noun ~roup has been forme&, of which the modifier is a 
coordinate group of adjectives. Each adjective is marked as 
a member in the coordinate group, which itself assumes the 
properties of an adjective.

The th i rd  ana lys i s  pass has the funct ion  of  c reat in6  
gen i t ive  and prepos i t iona l  inks .  Only the former are

Were there  a~ prepos i t iona l  groups fo l lowingnounsw then the 
prepositional groups woul& also be linked in as qualifiers. 
The second analysis pass ignored all conjunctions which 
di~ not occur explicitly within simple noun groups (i.e. 
groups with a single noun as head). The fourth pass, however, 
seeks to join to existing noun groups any other nouns linke~ 
by coordinat~ conjunctions:- 
Beauuz .... ~ g "  
qepHN~ 
nx$pauw ~ C& 
HO~888HH 
KecTa - ~ -NO,  
sanxcx__ _ 
rpaswn._ 
In addition the pass groups together in coordinate groups any 
similar words joined by coordinating conjunctions, whatever their 
part of speech. Intervening punctuation prevents the formation 
of coordinate groups. The coordinate group, when formed, is 
given the grammatical significance of its component parts.

The f i f th  analys is  pass has l i t t le  e f feot  on our sample

Were there adjacent adverbs Or prepos i t iona l  groups, these 
would be included in the verb group with the ro le  of  adjunct .  
The f i f th  pass a lso has provis ion fo r  negative and condi t iona l  
pred icate  struotuz'es. 
The function of the sixth pass is to try an~ resolve the 
roles of certain more "~fficult" words. (No instances occur 
in the sample sentence). For example, if one of the ambiguous 
persons/ /possess ive pronouns is  encounterea, ~ check is made to 
see whether the fo l lowing sentence element is  nominal. ? I f  i t  
i s ,  then the pronoun is  jo ined in  the element as a modifier~ and 
the pronoun is treated as possessive. Forms of the verb 6HT~ 
? which were not covered by the provisions of p~ss five, ere also 
included in the sixth pass. 
? i 
H~wing completed the sixth pass, no further analysis of the 
Russian sentence is  undertaken. The se~tenee s t ruc ture  
-16  - 
delineate& by the analysis passes is not complete, since no 
attempt is made to set up a clause strusture. However, in order 
the prooed~lz'e, all the to facilitate the task of (andSynthesis 
separate group s t ructures  any remaining separate elements) 
are a rb i t ra r i l y  connecte~ together  in  one or more higher groups, 
p resent i~  the appearance of a un i f ied  whole to the synthes is  
stage. 
On the other hand if further analysis passes were applie&, 
particularly with reference to clause delimitation (for example, 
see Appendix I of re~erenoe I), then the sample sentence woul~ 
appear as:~

The t rans la t ion  sequence is completed by an Engl ish synthesis  
process.  This determines re -order ings ,  inser t ions ,  in f lec t ions  
and se lect ions  of  English equivalents,  and, f ina l ly ,  the format 
of  the pr inte~ output, produoe~ by the computer on paper tape an~ 
pr inte~ on a f lexowr i te r .  This process i s  desoribe~ in the 
companion paper, which also includes an account of  the descr ipt ive
