Abstract
This paper explores the use of innovative
kernels based on syntactic and semantic
structures for a target relation extraction
task. Syntax is derived from constituent
and dependency parse trees whereas se-
mantics concerns to entity types and lex-
ical sequences. We investigate the effec-
tiveness of such representations in the au-
tomated relation extraction from texts. We
process the above data by means of Sup-
port Vector Machines along with the syn-
tactic tree, the partial tree and the word
sequence kernels. Our study on the ACE
2004 corpus illustrates that the combina-
tion of the above kernels achieves high ef-
fectiveness and significantly improves the
current state-of-the-art.
1 Introduction
Relation Extraction (RE) is defined in ACE as the
task of finding relevant semantic relations between
pairs of entities in texts. Figure 1 shows part
of a document from ACE 2004 corpus, a collec-
tion of news articles. In the text, the relation be-
tween president and NBC?s entertainment division
describes the relationship between the first entity
(person) and the second (organization) where the
person holds a managerial position.
Several approaches have been proposed for au-
tomatically learning semantic relations from texts.
Among others, there has been increased interest in
the application of kernel methods (Zelenko et al,
2002; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004; Bunescu and
Mooney, 2005a; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005b;
Zhang et al, 2005; Wang, 2008). Their main prop-
erty is the ability of exploiting a huge amount of

tives said.

features without an explicit feature representation.
This can be done by computing a kernel function
between a pair of linguistic objects, where such
function is a kind of similarity measure satisfy-
ing certain properties. An example is the sequence
kernel (Lodhi et al, 2002), where the objects are
strings of characters and the kernel function com-
putes the number of common subsequences of
characters in the two strings. Such substrings are
then weighted according to a decaying factor pe-
nalizing longer ones. In the same line, Tree Ker-
nels count the number of subtree shared by two in-
put trees. An example is that of syntactic (or sub-
set) tree kernel (SST) (Collins and Duffy, 2001),
where trees encode grammatical derivations.
Previous work on the use of kernels for RE
has exploited some similarity measures over di-
verse features (Zelenko et al, 2002; Culotta and
Sorensen, 2004; Zhang et al, 2005) or subse-
quence kernels over dependency graphs (Bunescu
and Mooney, 2005a; Wang, 2008). More specif-
ically, (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005a; Culotta
and Sorensen, 2004) use kernels over depen-
dency trees, which showed much lower accuracy
than feature-based methods (Zhao and Grishman,
2005). One problem of the dependency kernels
above is that they do not exploit the overall struc-
tural aspects of dependency trees. A more effec-
tive solution is the application of convolution ker-
nels to constituent parse trees (Zhang et al, 2006)
but this is not satisfactory from a general per-
1378
spective since dependency structures offer some
unique advantages, which should be exploited by
an appropriate kernel.
Therefore, studying convolution tree kernels for
dependency trees is worthwhile also considering
that, to the best of our knowledge, these models
have not been previously used for relation extrac-
tion
1
task. Additionally, sequence kernels should
be included in such global study since some of
their forms have not been applied to RE.
In this paper, we study and evaluate diverse con-
volution and sequence kernels for the RE problem
by providing several kernel combinations on con-
stituent and dependency trees and sequential struc-
tures. To fully exploit the potential of dependency
trees, in addition to the SST kernel, we applied
the partial tree (PT) kernel proposed in (Moschitti,
2006), which is a general convolution tree kernel
adaptable for dependency structures. We also in-
vestigate various sequence kernels (e.g. the word
sequence kernel (WSK) (Cancedda et al, 2003))
by incorporating dependency structures into word
sequences. These are also enriched by including
information from constituent parse trees.
We conduct experiments on the standard ACE
2004 newswire and broadcast news domain. The
results show that although some kernels are less
effective than others, they exhibit properties that
are complementary to each other. In particu-
lar, we found that relation extraction can benefit
from increasing the feature space by combining
kernels (with a simple summation) exploiting the
two different parsing paradigms. Our experiments
on RE show that the current composite kernel,
which is constituent-based is more effective than
those based on dependency trees and individual
sequence kernel but at the same time their com-
binations, i.e. dependency plus constituent trees,
improve the state-of-the-art in RE. More interest-
ingly, also the combinations of various sequence
kernels gain significant better performance than
the current state-of-the-art (Zhang et al, 2005).
Overall, these results are interesting for the
computational linguistics research since they show
that the above two parsing paradigms provide dif-
ferent and important information for a semantic
task such as RE. Regarding sequence-based ker-
nels, the WSK gains better performance than pre-
vious sequence and dependency models for RE.

The function defined on (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004),
although on dependency trees, is not a convolution tree ker-
nel.
A review of previous work on RE is described
in Section 2. Section 3 introduces support vec-
tor machines and kernel methods whereas our spe-
cific kernels for RE are described is Section 4. The
experiments and conclusions are presented in sec-
tions 5 and 6, respectively.
2 Related Work
To identify semantic relations using machine
learning, three learning settings have mainly been
applied, namely supervised methods (Miller et
al., 2000; Zelenko et al, 2002; Culotta and
Sorensen, 2004; Kambhatla, 2004; Zhou et al,
2005), semi supervised methods (Brin, 1998;
Agichtein and Gravano, 2000), and unsupervised
method (Hasegawa et al, 2004). In a supervised
learning setting, representative related work can
be classified into generative models (Miller et al,
2000), feature-based (Roth and tau Yih, 2002;
Kambhatla, 2004; Zhao and Grishman, 2005;
Zhou et al, 2005) or kernel-based methods (Ze-
lenko et al, 2002; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004;
Bunescu and Mooney, 2005a; Zhang et al, 2005;
Wang, 2008; Zhang et al, 2006).
The learning model employed in (Miller et al,
2000) used statistical parsing techniques to learn
syntactic parse trees. It demonstrated that a lexi-
calized, probabilistic context-free parser with head
rules can be used effectively for information ex-
traction. Meanwhile, feature-based approaches
often employ various kinds of linguistic, syntac-
tic or contextual information and integrate into
the feature space. (Roth and tau Yih, 2002) ap-
plied a probabilistic approach to solve the prob-
lems of named entity and relation extraction with
the incorporation of various features such as word,
part-of-speech, and semantic information from
WordNet. (Kambhatla, 2004) employed maximum
entropy models with diverse features including
words, entity and mention types and the number
of words (if any) separating the two entities.
Recent work on Relation Extraction has mostly
employed kernel-based approaches over syntac-
tic parse trees. Kernels on parse trees were pi-
oneered by (Collins and Duffy, 2001). This
kernel function counts the number of common
subtrees, weighted appropriately, as the measure
of similarity between two parse trees. (Culotta
and Sorensen, 2004) extended this work to cal-
culate kernels between augmented dependency
trees. (Zelenko et al, 2002) proposed extracting
1379
relations by computing kernel functions between
parse trees. (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005a) pro-
posed a shortest path dependency kernel by stipu-
lating that the information to model a relationship
between two entities can be captured by the short-
est path between them in the dependency graph.
Although approaches in RE have been domi-
nated by kernel-based methods, until now, most
of research in this line has used the kernel as some
similarity measures over diverse features (Zelenko
et al, 2002; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004; Bunescu
and Mooney, 2005a; Zhang et al, 2005; Wang,
2008). These are not convolution kernels and pro-
duce a much lower number of substructures than
the PT kernel. A recent approach successfully em-
ploys a convolution tree kernel (of type SST) over
constituent syntactic parse tree (Zhang et al, 2006;
Zhou et al, 2007), but it does not capture gram-
matical relations in dependency structure. We be-
lieve that an efficient and appropriate kernel can
be used to solve the RE problem, exploiting the
advantages of dependency structures, convolution
tree kernels and sequence kernels.
3 Support Vector Machines and Kernel
Methods
In this section we give a brief introduction to sup-
port vector machines, kernel methods, diverse tree
and sequence kernel spaces, which can be applied
to the RE task.
3.1 Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
Support Vector Machines refer to a supervised ma-
chine learning technique based on the latest results
of the statistical learning theory (Vapnik, 1998).
Given a vector space and a set of training points,
i.e. positive and negative examples, SVMs find a
separating hyperplane H(~x) = ~? ? ~x + b = 0
where ? ? R
n
and b ? R are learned by applying
the Structural Risk Minimization principle (Vap-
nik, 1995). SVMs is a binary classifier, but it can
be easily extended to multi-class classifier, e.g. by
means of the one-vs-all method (Rifkin and Pog-
gio, 2002).
One strong point of SVMs is the possibility to
apply kernel methods (robert Mller et al, 2001)
to implicitly map data in a new space where the
examples are more easily separable as described
in the next section.
3.2 Kernel Methods
Kernel methods (Schlkopf and Smola, 2001) are
an attractive alternative to feature-based methods
since the applied learning algorithm only needs
to compute a product between a pair of objects
(by means of kernel functions), avoiding the ex-
plicit feature representation. A kernel function
is a scalar product in a possibly unknown feature
space. More precisely, The object o is mapped in
~x with a feature function ? : O ? <
n
, whereO is
the set of the objects.
The kernel trick allows us to rewrite the deci-
sion hyperplane as:
H(~x) =
(
?
i=1..l
y
i
?
i
~x
i
)
? ~x+ b =
?
i=1..l
y
i
?
i
~x
i
? ~x+ b =
?
i=1..l
y
i
?
i
?(o
i
) ? ?(o) + b,
where y
i
is equal to 1 for positive and -1 for neg-
ative examples, ?
i
? < with ?
i
? 0, o
i
?i ?
{1, .., l} are the training instances and the product
K(o
i
, o) = ??(o
i
) ? ?(o)? is the kernel function
associated with the mapping ?.
Kernel engineering can be carried out by com-
bining basic kernels with additive or multiplica-
tive operators or by designing specific data objects
(vectors, sequences and tree structures) for the tar-
get tasks.
Regarding NLP applications, kernel methods
have attracted much interest due to their ability
of implicitly exploring huge amounts of structural
features automatically extracted from the origi-
nal object representation. The kernels for struc-
tured natural language data, such as parse tree
kernel (Collins and Duffy, 2001) and string ker-
nel (Lodhi et al, 2002) are examples of the well-
known convolution kernels used in many NLP ap-
plications.
Tree kernels represent trees in terms of their
substructures (called tree fragments). Such frag-
ments form a feature space which, in turn, is
mapped into a vector space. Tree kernels mea-
sure the similarity between pair of trees by count-
ing the number of fragments in common. There
are three important characterizations of fragment
type (Moschitti, 2006): the SubTrees (ST), the
SubSet Trees (SST) and the Partial Trees (PT). For
sake of space, we do not report the mathematical
description of them, which is available in (Vish-
wanathan and Smola, 2002), (Collins and Duffy,
1380
2001) and (Moschitti, 2006), respectively. In con-
trast, we report some descriptions in terms of fea-
ture space that may be useful to understand the
new engineered kernels.
In principle, a SubTree (ST) is defined by tak-
ing any node along with its descendants. A Sub-
Set Tree (SST) is a more general structure which
does not necessarily include all the descendants. It
must be generated by applying the same grammat-
ical rule set, which generated the original tree. A
Partial Tree (PT) is a more general form of sub-
structures obtained by relaxing constraints over
the SST.
4 Kernels for Relation Extraction
In this section we describe the previous kernels
based on constituent trees as well as new kernels
based on diverse types of trees and sequences for
relation extraction. As mentioned in the previ-
ous section, we can engineer kernels by combin-
ing tree and sequence kernels. Thus we focus on
the problem to define structure embedding the de-
sired syntactic relational information between two
named entities (NEs).
4.1 Constituent and Dependency Structures
Syntactic parsing (or syntactic analysis) aims at
identifying grammatical structures in a text. A
parser thus captures the hidden hierarchy of the
input text and processes it into a form suitable for
further processing. There are two main paradigms
for representing syntactic information: constituent
and dependency parsing, which produces two dif-
ferent tree structures.
Constituent tree encodes structural properties
of a sentence. The parse tree contains constituents,
such as noun phrases (NP) and verb phrases (VP),
as well as terminals/part-of-speech tags, such as
determiners (DT) or nouns (NN). Figure 2.a shows
the constituent tree of the sentence: In Washing-
ton, U.S. officials are working overtime.
Dependency tree encodes grammatical rela-
tions between words in a sentence with the words
as nodes and dependency types as edges. An edge
from a word to another represents a grammatical
relation between these two. Every word in a de-
pendency tree has exactly one parent except the
root. Figure 2.b shows and example of the depen-
dency tree of the previous sentence.
Given two NEs, such as Washington and offi-
cials, both the above trees can encode the syntactic
dependencies between them. However, since each
parse tree corresponds to a sentence, there may be
more than two NEs and many relations expressed
in a sentence. Thus, the use of the entire parse
tree of the whole sentence holds two major draw-
backs: first, it may be too computationally expen-
sive for kernel calculation since the size of a com-
plete parse tree may be very large (up to 300 nodes
in the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al, 1993)); sec-
ond, there is ambiguity on the target pairs of NEs,
i.e. different NEs associated with different rela-
tions are described by the same parse tree. There-
fore, it is necessary to identify the portion of the
parse tree that best represent the useful syntactic
information.
Let e
1
and e
2
be two entity mentions in the same
sentence such that they are in a relationship R.
For the constituent parse tree, we used the path-
enclosed tree (PET), which was firstly proposed
in (Moschitti, 2004) for Semantic Role Labeling
and then adapted by (Zhang et al, 2005) for re-
lation extraction. It is the smallest common sub-
tree including the two entities of a relation. The
dashed frame in Figure 2.a surrounds PET associ-
ated with the two mentions, officials and Washing-
ton. Moreover, to improve the representation, two
extra nodes T1-PER, denoting the type PERSON,
and T2-LOC, denoting the type LOCATION, are
added to the parse tree, above the two target NEs,
respectively. In this example, the above PET is de-
signed to capture the relation Located-in between
the entities ?officials? and ?Washington? from the
ACE corpus. Note that, a third NE, U.S., is char-
acterized by the node GPE (GeoPolitical Entity),
where the absence of the prefix T1 or T2 before
the NE type (i.e. GPE), denotes that the NE does
not take part in the target relation.
In previous work, some dependency trees have
been used (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005a; Wang,
2008) but the employed kernel just exploited the
syntactic information concentrated in the path be-
tween e
1
and e
2
. In contrast, we defined and stud-
ied three different dependency structures whose
potential can be fully exploited by our convolution
partial tree kernel:
- Dependency Words (DW) tree is similar to
PET adapted for dependency tree constituted
by simple words. We select the minimal sub-
tree which includes e
1
and e
2
, and we insert
an extra node as father of the NEs, labeled
with the NE category. For example, given
1381
Figure 2: The constituent and dependency parse trees integrated with entity information
the tree in Figure 2.b, we design the tree in
Figure 2.c surrounded by the dashed frames,
where T1-PER, T2-LOC and GPE are the ex-
tra nodes inserted as fathers of Washington,
soldier and U.S..
- Grammatical Relation (GR) tree, i.e. the DW
tree in which words are replaced by their
grammatical functions, e.g. prep, pobj and
nsubj. For example, Figure 2.d, shows the
GR tree for the previous relation: In is re-
placed by prep , U.S. by nsubj and so on.
- Grammatical Relation and Words (GRW)
tree, words and grammatical functions are
both used in the tree, where the latter are in-
serted as a father node of the former. For
example, Figure 2.e, shows such tree for the
previous relation.
4.2 Sequential Structures
Some sequence kernels have been used on depen-
dency structures (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005b;
Wang, 2008). These kernels just used lexical
words with some syntactic information. To fully
exploit syntactic and semantic information, we de-
fined and studied six different sequences (in a style
similar to what proposed in (Moschitti, 2008)),
which include features from constituent and de-
pendency parse trees and NEs:
1. Sequence of terminals (lexical words) in the
PET (SK
1
), e.g.:
T2-LOC Washington , U.S. T1-PER officials.
2. Sequence of part-of-speech (POS) tags in the
PET (SK
2
), i.e. the SK
1
in which words are
replaced by their POS tags, e.g.:
T2-LOC NN , NNP T1-PER NNS.
3. Sequence of grammatical relations in the
1382
PET (SK
3
), i.e. the SK
1
in which words are
replaced by their grammatical functions, e.g.:
T2-LOC pobj , nn T1-PER nsubj.
4. Sequence of words in the DW (SK
4
), e.g.:
Washington T2-LOC In working T1-PER of-
ficials GPE U.S..
5. Sequence of grammatical relations in the GR
(SK
5
), i.e. the SK
4
in which words are re-
placed by their grammatical functions, e.g.:
pobj T2-LOC prep ROOT T1-PER nsubj GPE
nn.
6. Sequence of POS tags in the DW (SK
6
), i.e.
the SK
4
in which words are replaced by their
POS tags, e.g.:
NN T2-LOC IN VBP T1-PER NNS GPE
NNP.
It is worth noting that the potential information
contained in such sequences can be fully exploited
by the word sequence kernel.
4.3 Combining Kernels
Given that syntactic information from different
parse trees may have different impact on relation
extraction (RE), the viable approach to study the
role of dependency and constituent parsing is to
experiment with different syntactic models and
measuring the impact in terms of RE accuracy.
For this purpose we compared the composite ker-
nel described in (Zhang et al, 2006) with the par-
tial tree kernels applied to DW , GR, and GRW
and sequence kernels based on six sequences de-
scribed above. The composite kernels include
polynomial kernel applied to entity-related feature
vector. The word sequence kernel (WSK) is al-
ways applied to sequential structures. The used
kernels are described in more detail below.
4.3.1 Polynomial Kernel
The basic kernel between two named entities of
the ACE documents is defined as:
K
P
(R
1
, R
2
) =
?
i=1,2
K
E
(R
1
.E
i
, R
2
.E
i
),
where R
1
and R
2
are two relation instances, E
i
is
the i
th
entity of a relation instance. K
E
(?, ?) is a
kernel over entity features, i.e.:
K
E
(E
1
, E
2
) = (1 + ~x
1
? ~x
2
)
2
,
where ~x
1
and ~x
2
are two feature vectors extracted
from the two NEs.
For the ACE 2004, the features used include:
entity headword, entity type, entity subtype, men-
tion type, and LDC
2
mention type. The last four
attributes are taken from the ACE corpus 2004. In
ACE, each mention has a head annotation and an
extent annotation.
4.3.2 Kernel Combinations
1. Polynomial kernel plus a tree kernel:
CK
1
= ? ?K
P
+ (1? ?) ?K
x
,
where ? is a coefficient to give more impact
to K
P
and K
x
is either the partial tree ker-
nel applied to one the possible dependency
structures, DW, GR or GRW or the SST ker-
nel applied to PET, described in the previous
section.
2. Polynomial kernel plus constituent plus de-
pendency tree kernels:
CK
2
= ? ?K
P
+ (1? ?) ? (K
SST
+K
PT
)
where K
SST
is the SST kernel and K
PT
is
the partial tree kernel (applied to the related
structures as in point 1).
3. Constituent tree plus square of polynomial
kernel and dependency tree kernel:
CK
3
= ? ?K
SST
+ (1??) ? (K
P
+K
PT
)
2
4. Dependency word tree plus grammatical re-
lation tree kernels:
CK
4
= K
PT?DW
+K
PT?GR
where K
PT?DW
and K
PT?GR
are the par-
tial tree kernels applied to dependency struc-
tures DW and GR.
5. Polynomial kernel plus dependency word
plus grammatical relation tree kernels:
CK
5
= ??K
P
+(1??)?(K
PT?DW
+K
PT?GR
)
Some preliminary experiments on a validation set
showed that the second, the fourth and the fifth
combinations yield the best performance with ? =
0.4 while the first and the third combinations yield
the best performance with ? = 0.23.
Regarding WSK, the following combinations
are applied:

5. CSK = ? ?K

Preliminary experiments showed that the last com-
bination yields the best performance with ? =
0.23.
We used a polynomial expansion to explore the
bi-gram features of i) the first and the second en-
tity participating in the relation, ii) grammatical
relations which replace words in the dependency
tree. Since the kernel function set is closed un-
der normalization, polynomial expansion and lin-
ear combination (Schlkopf and Smola, 2001), all
the illustrated composite kernels are also proper
kernels.
5 Experiments
Our experiments aim at investigating the effec-
tiveness of convolution kernels adapted to syntac-
tic parse trees and various sequence kernels for
the RE task. For this purpose, we use the sub-
set and partial tree kernel over different kinds of
trees, namely constituent and dependency syntac-
tic parse trees. Diverse sequences are applied indi-
vidually and in combination together. We consider
our task of relation extraction as a classification
problem where categories are relation types. All
pairs of entity mentions in the same sentence are
taken to generate potential relations, which will be
processed as positive and negative examples.
5.1 Experimental setup
We use the newswire and broadcast news domain
in the English portion of the ACE 2004 corpus
provided by LDC. This data portion includes 348
documents and 4400 relation instances. It defines
seven entity types and seven relation types. Every
relation is assigned one of the seven types: Phys-
ical, Person/Social, Employment/Membership/-
Subsidiary, Agent-Artifact, PER/ORG Affiliation,
GPE Affiliation, and Discourse. For sake of space,
we do not explain these relationships here, never-
theless, they are explicitly described in the ACE
document guidelines. There are 4400 positive and
38,696 negative examples when generating pairs
of entity mentions as potential relations.
Documents are parsed using Stanford
Parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) to pro-
duce parse trees. Potential relations are generated
by iterating all pairs of entity mentions in the same
sentence. Entity information, namely entity type,
is integrated into parse trees. To train and test our
binary relation classifier, we used SVMs. Here,
relation detection is formulated as a multiclass
classification problem. The one vs. rest strategy
is employed by selecting the instance with largest
margin as the final answer. For experimentation,
we use 5-fold cross-validation with the Tree
Kernel Tools (Moschitti, 2004) (available at
http://disi.unitn.it/?moschitt/Tree-Kernel.htm).
5.2 Results
In this section, we report the results of different
kernels setup over constituent (CT) and depen-
dency (DP) parse trees and sequences taken from
these parse trees. The tree kernel (TK), compos-
ite kernel (CK
1
, CK
2
, CK
3
, CK
4
, and CK
5
corresponding to five combination types in Sec-
tion 4.3.2) were employed over these two syntactic
trees. For the tree kernel, we apply the SST kernel
for the path-enclosed tree (PET) of the constituent
tree and the PT kernel for three kinds of depen-
dency tree DW, GR, and GRW, described in the
previous section. The two composite kernels CK
2
and CK
3
are applied over both two parse trees.
The word sequence kernels are applied over six
sequences SK
1
, SK
2
, SK
3
, SK
4
, SK
5
, and SK
6
(described in Section 4.3).
The results are shown in Table 1 and Table 2.
In the first table, the first column indicates the
structure used in the combination shown in the
second column, e.g. PET associated with CK
1
means that the SST kernel is applied on PET (a
portion of the constituent tree) and combined with
the CK
1
schema whereas PET and GR associated
with CK
5
means that SST kernel is applied to
PET and PT kernel is applied to GR in CK
5
. The
remaining three columns report Precision, Recall
and F1 measure. The interpretation of the second
table is more immediate since the only tree ker-
nel involved is the SST kernel applied to PET and
combined by means of CK
1
.
We note that: first, the dependency kernels,

a slightly smaller result than the original version
(i.e. an F1 of about 72 using a different syntactic
parser).
Second, CK
1
improves to 70.5, when the con-
tribution of PT kernel applied to GR (dependency
tree built using grammatical relations) is added.
This suggests that dependency structures are effec-
tively exploited by PT kernel and that such infor-
mation is somewhat complementary to constituent
trees.
Third, in the second table, the model CK
1
+
SSK, which adds to CK
1
the contribution of di-
verse sequence kernels, outperforms the state-of-
the-art by 2.6%. This suggests that the sequential
information encoded by several sequence kernels
can better represents the dependency information.
Finally, we also report in the last row (in italic)
the superior RE result by (Zhou et al, 2007).
However, to achieve this outcome the authors used
the composite kernel CK
1
with several heuristics
to define an effective portion of constituent trees.
Such heuristics expand the tree and remove unnec-
essary information allowing a higher improvement
on RE. They are tuned on the target RE task so al-
though the result is impressive, we cannot use it to
compare with pure automatic learning approaches,
such us our models.
6 Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we study the use of several types
of syntactic information: constituent and depen-
dency syntactic parse trees. A relation is repre-
sented by taking the path-enclosed tree (PET) of
the constituent tree or of the path linking two enti-
ties of the dependency tree. For the design of auto-
matic relation classifiers, we have investigated the
impact of dependency structures to the RE task.
Our novel composite kernels, which account for
the two syntactic structures, are experimented with
the appropriate convolution kernels and show sig-
nificant improvement with respect to the state-of-
the-art in RE.
Regarding future work, there are many research
line that may be followed:
i) Capturing more features by employing ex-
ternal knowledge such as ontological, lexical re-
source or WordNet-based features (Basili et al,
2005a; Basili et al, 2005b; Bloehdorn et al, 2006;
Bloehdorn and Moschitti, 2007) or shallow se-
mantic trees, (Giuglea and Moschitti, 2004; Giu-
glea and Moschitti, 2006; Moschitti and Bejan,
2004; Moschitti et al, 2007; Moschitti, 2008;
Moschitti et al, 2008).
ii) Design a new tree-based structures, which
combines the information of both constituent and
dependency parses. From dependency trees we
can extract more precise but also more sparse
relationships (which may cause overfit). From
constituent trees, we can extract subtrees consti-
tuted by non-terminal symbols (grammar sym-
bols), which provide a better generalization (with
a risk of underfitting).
iii) Design a new kernel which can integrate the
advantages of the constituent and dependency tree.
The new tree kernel should inherit the benefits of
the three available tree kernels: ST, SST or PT.
