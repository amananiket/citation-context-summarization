We shal l  be concerned in th is  paper  w i th  the 
log ica l  ana lys i s  of natura l  language on the bas is  
of Lesn iewsk i ' s  onto logy ,  wh ich  is a log ica l  sys tem 
wi thout  type-d is t inc t ion  between ind iv idua ls  and 
monad ic  pred icates .  Th is ,  it is be l ieved ,  is a lso  
one of the features  of  natura l  language,  and use 
w i l l  be made of  th is  feature  for deve lop ing  a f rag-  
ment  of n a tnra l  language.  
I In t roduct ion  Accord ing  to Montague every  s imple  sentence  of  
natura l  language is of the fo rm 
Np + Vp = (Det + N) + Vp, 
and, as emphas ized  by Barwise -Cooper  \[1\] Det + N const i tu tes  a gen-  
e ra l i zed  quant i f ie r  to be app l ied  to Vp or verb  phrase  as one-p lace  
pred icate .  (For Montague grammar  consu l t  among others  Montague\ [10 \ ] ,  
Cresswe l l  \[3\] and J i rku  \ [6\]<) 
Thus,  s imple  sentences  suck as: 
.1 the man wa lks ,  
.2 every  man wa lks ,  
? 3 some (a) men (man) wa lk (s )  
.4 (at least )  two men wa lk ,  
? 5 (at least )  th ree  men walk ,  
are respect ive ly ,o f  the fo l low ing  log ica l  forms:  
1.11 (kPkQP1x man) wa lk ,  
1 .21 (~P~Q~x(P  x O Q x) man) walk ,  
1 .31 (XP%Q3x(P  x A Q x) man) walk ,  
1 .~l  (kPkQBxBy(P  x ^ P y A P x A Q y A xz~ y)  man) Walk ,  
1 .51 (kPkQBx~y3z(P  x A Q y ~ Q x A Q y A P z ~ Q z A 
x~y A y~z A z~x) .man)  walk ,  
where  Q IxP  x is the Russe l l i an - type  def in i te  descr ip t ion  to be de-  
f ined as 
~x(P  x ~ Q x) A ~x~ty(P x A P Y .~ X~ry)  , 
w i th  the scope res t r i c ted  to Q. 
By means  of k-con,~ersion, for example,"  f rom 1.11 and 1 .21 we 
respect ive ly  obta in :  
wa lk  ix man x, 
and 
Vx(man x O walk  x), 
so that  Det + N now becomes  in both  cases  a genera l i zed  quant i f ie r .

(Here as wel l  as in what fol lows intension wi l l  not be taken into 
considerat ion.  The proposed Lesn iewsk ian theory wi l l  there fore  
be extens ional . )  
Now it is to be remembered that 1 .11-1.51 are the formulas of 
(second-order)  predicate logic. In other words,  the sentences of 
natura l  language are embedded in pred icate  logic a l though a large 
number of formulas of the logic do not have thei r  counterparts  in 
natura l  language. 
However,  the embedding in t rad i t iona l  pred icate  logic is not 
necessar i ly  the only poss ib le  way for us to unders tand the logica l  
s t ructure of natural  language. In fact, natura l  language could also 
be embedded in Lesn iewsk i ' s  onto logy augmented by a number of add- 
i t ional  not ions so that a f ragment of natura l  language can be ac- 
comodated there, and ~n what fol lows we shall  be concerned with a 
deta i led const ruct ion  of Lesn iewsk ian- type  logica l  grammar. 
2 Logica l  ~rammar  based upon Lesn iewsk i1~ onto logy In Lesniew-  
sk ian- type Montague grammar we are all the same star t ing from the 
st ructura l  assumpt ion  of the simple sentences of natura l  language 
as ment ioned at the beg inn ing  of the last section. Neverthe l@ss,  
in Lesn iewsk ian  vers ion of log ica l  grammar,  which wi l l  be abbre-  
v ia ted as LMG in the sequel,  Det, i.e. determiners ,  are represented  
not by genera l i zed  quant i f iers  but by the functors of Lesn iewsk i ' s  
onto logy with noun and in t rans i t ive  verb phrases to be combined 
thereby as two arguments,  which are now prov ided with the category  
of names in the sense of Lesn iewsk i ' s  onto logy,  not the one corres-  
ponding to monadic  pred icates  of predicate logic. 
Without  going into the detai ls  of the phrase st ructure and 
t rans format iona l  rules necessary  for generat ing  a f ragment of Eng- 
l ish (which is by far smal ler  than that proposed by Cooper -Parsons  
\[2\] ) we shal l  present  the deep or log ica l  structures of a number of 
s imple sentences (of Engl ish) as (wel l - formed) sentences be long ing  
to the proposed Lesn iewsk ian  vers ion of Montague grammar to be de-~ 
s ignated as LMG: 
2.11 ((the man) walk),  
2.12 ((every ((man or ) woman))  speak), 
2.13 ((some woman) not play)) ,  
2.14 ((every man) \[love (some woman)\] ) 
2.15 (the woman) \[(love and) admire) \] ' 
(every (boy ( or girl)\] l) 
2.16 (not ((every man) speak)),  
where \[ \] l  is a combinator  or operator  which makes an in t rans i t ive  
verb phrase out of a t rans i t ive  verb and a noun phrase. This com- 
b inator  is represented  by a dec lens ion in in f lect iona l  languages 
such as Slavic ones, whi le  in the case of un in f lec ted  languages such 
as Engl ish it is taken care of by word order. 
It is remarked that any combinator  could somet imes be app l ied  
from the left  to the r ight as suggested by Cresswel l  \[5\] ? This has 
a l ready been pract i sed  in som@ of the above sample sentences.  Thus 
such sentences like: 
( (every man) \[(some (dog (or cat )) love\] 1 ), 
and 
((some woman) \[(some man)( love  not)\] 1 ), 
are also we l l - fo rmed,  be ing close to the word order usual  in Japa- 
nese. 
As is wel l  known, 2.14 has another  deep or log ica l  s t ructure 
in quant i f i ca t iona l  theory with 'some' hav ing the wider  scope than 
'every'. In this case, the given sentence is of the form: 
( \[(every man) love\] 2 (some woman)) ,  
A LESNIEWSKIAN VERSION OF MONTAGUE GRAMMAR 141 
where \[ !2 combines a noun phrase and a t rans i t ive verb phrase 
giving rlse to an expression corresponding to a monadic predicate.  
But, unl ike \[ \]l, the doun phrase to be combined is in the nom- 
inative case. 
The use of \[ \]2 wil l  be i l lustrated as follows: 
2.21 (\[(some man) hate\] 2 (every woman)),  
2.22 ((every woman) \[(some man) hate\]2),  
which are of the same structure with each other with 'some man' re- 
main ing the subject of these sentences. 
As fs easi ly understood from the development up to the present,  
the (wel l - formed) expressions of the proposed LMG as a logic are de- 
f ined in terms of the expressions both constant nnd var iable having 
the category of names in the sense of Lesniewski 's  ontology and re- 
lat ions as well  as of a number of logical  operators not only senten- 
tial and quant i f i cat iona l  but also name-for~ing and re lat ion-#orm- 
ing. (For Lesniewski 's  ontology consult Iwanus \[5\], Luschei \[9\] 
and Slupecki  \[11\]. ) 
3 Ax iomat izat ion of LMG as a logic ;w~ If we are to develop 
LMG as a logic,we have to axiomatize it as a logical  system. 
Fortunate ly  the ax iomat izat ion of Lesniewski 's  ontology has 
been intens ively  worked out ever since its single axiom was first 
proposed by Lesniewski  h imsel f  in 1921. 
Thus, we are start ing with the ce lebrated single axiom origi-  
nat ing from Lesniewski :  
3.01 e(a, b) ~ .(3x)e(x, a) 
~(x)(~(x, a)O ~(x, b)) 
A(x) (y) (C(x ,  a )A  ?(y, a ) .O  E(x, y)), 
or its s impl i f ied version by Soboeinski  \ [19  : 
3.o2 ~(a, b) ~ (~x)(~(x, a) ^ E(x, b)) 
(x)(y)(~(x, a) A ~(y, a ) .D  ~(x, y)), 
where e stands for 'the' and a, b,... and ~he l ike are (meta-) log- 
ical var iables ranging over the expressions of the category of Les- 
n iewskian names. On the other hand, e(a, b) stands for ((ea) b) or 
((a e) b) or (b (ea)) or (b (a e)), which are for thcoming as a re- 
sult of the l ibera l i zat ion due to Cresswel l  \[3\]. Analogously ,  
A(a, b) (l(a, b)) represents ((A a) b) etc. ((I a) b~ etc.) with 
A (I) tak ing the place of 'every' ('some' ). (A and I are also 
known as sy l logist ic  funetors corresponding to 'every' and 'some' 
respect ively. )  
Nevertheless,  3.01 or 3.02 is not enough to develop LMG as a 
language. In fact, we need a number of addit ional  axiom (schemata) 
for tak ing care of name- and re lat ion- forming ( log ica l )operators  
and the express ions involv ing \[ \]1 and \[ \]2. 
The axiom (schemata) st ipulat ing these operators are wel l -  
known, being of the forms: 
3.11 e(a, b and c) 5 .E(a, b) A e(a, c), 
3.12 e(a, b or e) ~ .c(a, b) V e(a, c), 
3.21 e(a, not b) ~.e(a, a )A~e(a  , b), 
3.22 (R and S)(a, b) ~ .R(a, b) A S(a, b), 
3.23 (R or S)(a, b) ~ .R(a, b) V S(a, b), 
3.24 not R(a, b) ~ .e(a, a) A e(b, b )A~ R(a, b), 
3.25 en R(a, b) ~ R(b, a) 
3.26 R(a, b) ~ .e(a, a) A g(b, b), 
where in 3.26 R is atomic. We are also abbrev iat ing  such expres-  
142 A. ISHIMOTO 
s ions as ((R and)S)and the l ike as (R and S) for  the purpose  of  per -  
sp icu i ty .  
Lemma 3.3 3.25 ho lds  of  any re la t ion  R. 
This is eas i ly  p roved on the bas is  of  3 .23-3 .24  by induct ion  on 
the length  of  the g iven  R. 
3.~1 A(a, h) ~ (x)( c(x, a) D ~(x, h), 
3.h2 I (a,  b) ~ ~x) (  e(x,  a) ~ e(x, b)) .  
We are now present ing  some of  the ax iom (schemata) ,  wh ich  take  
care  of  the express ions  conta in ing  \[ \] 1 and  \[ \] 2. 
3.51 e(a, \[(e b) R\] 1 
.(Bx)( g(x, a )A  (3z)( ?(z, b) A R(x,  z)) 
A(x)(y)( ~(x, a) ^ E(y, a). O ~(x, y)) 
^(x)(y)( E(x, b) ^ ~(y, b). O ~(x, Y) 
3.52 A(a,  \[(I b) R\] 1 
(x)( s(x, a )O (BY)( e(y, b) % R(x,  y))  
3 .53 l (b,  \[(A a) R\] 2 ) 
(3y)( ~(y, b) A (x ) (  ~(x, a) O R(x, y)) 
It is not i ced  that  some of  these  ax ioms are not we l l - fo rmed as sen-  
tences  of  LMG as a language a l though they  be long  to LMG qua log ic .  
Theorem 3.7 Every  s imple  sentence  of  LMG (as a language)  is 
equ iva lent  to a sentence  (of LMG as a log ic ) ,  and  th is  sentence  in- 
vo lve  on ly  g and atomic  re la t ions  bes ides  log ica l  operators  w i th  
quant i f ie rs  b ind ing  on ly  such name var iab les  x and y as occur  there  
in the context  e(x,  a) or R(x,  y). 
The proof  is car r ied  out by induct ion  on the number  of  symbols  
o ther  than those  ment ioned in the theorem on the bas is  of  ax ioms.  
It is aga in  observed  that  the fo rmulas  to wh ich  these  sentences  
of  natura l  language are t rans formed are not  necessar i l y  those  be-  
long ing  to LMG as a language.  
4 T rans la t ion  of  LMG into pred icate  log ic  It w i l l  be shown 
in th is  sect ion  that  LMG as a language is embedded in f i r s t -o rder  
pred icate  log ic  (with equa l i ty )  v ia  a t rans la t ion  T to be def ined  
present ly .  (The proposed t rans la t ion  dates  f rom Pr io r  \[8\] and has 
been e laborated  by I sh imoto  \[4\] and Kobayash i - I sh imoto  \[7\].) 
The t rans la t ion  T is de f ined  by induct ion  on the number  of  the 
words  conta ined  in the g iven  express ion  of  LMG. 
In the f i rs t  p lace ,  the bas is  is taken  care of  by: 
T a = Fa, 
T b = Fb, 
where  a, b , . . .  are (a tomic)  names constant  and var iab le ,  and  Fa, Fb, 
... are monad ic  pred icates  aga in  constant  or var iab le  cor respond ing  
to a, b, . . .  not necessar i l y  exhaust ing  al l  o f  them. 
T e = IP IQQlxP  x, 
T A = IP IQ~x(P  x O Q x), 
T I = IP IQBx(P  x A Q x). 
We are now proceed ing  to the induct ion  steps:  
T aA8 = T a A T 8, 
T av8 = T a V T 8, 
T aDS = T e D T 8, 
T ~ =~T ~, 
T (x)a =VF x T G, 
T (Bx)a  =BF x T a, 
where  e, ~ .... are meta- log ica l  var iab les  rang ing  over  the 
A LESNIEWSKIAN VERSION OF MONTAGUE GRAMMAR 143 
sentences  of  LMG.  
Before" tak ing  up the t rans la t ion  of  re la t ions ,  i .e. t rans i t ive  
verbs  we have  to in t roduce  in advance  another  t rans la t ion  T 1 wh ich  
t rans forms every  re la t ion  in LMG into a (b inary)  re la t ion  of  pre-  
d icate  log ic .  The t rans la t ion  T 1 is de f ined  induct ive ly  on the num- 
ber  of  the  re la t ion - fo rming  operators  employed for de f in ing  the 
g iven  one. 
S tar t ing  w i th  the bas is :  
T 1 R = Ix lYGR(X  , y),  
where  G R is the (b inary)  re la t ion  (of the Dred icate  log ic )  cor res -  
pond ing  to the g ive a tomic  re la t ion  of  LMG, induct ion  steps are: 
T 1 H and S = Ix ly (T  l R(x,  y) A T, S(x,  y ) ) ,  
T I E or S = Ixly(Ti R(x, y) ~ T, S(x,  y)) ,  
T 1 not R = Ixly~Tl R(x , y) ,  
T 1 en E = IxlyTi R(y , x) 
(T1 R and S etc. w i l l  be abbrev ia ted  as Go . ~ ,e tc . )  
On the bas is  of  the t rans la tzon  T 1 thus in t roduced,  T is de- 
f ined  for any re la t ion  R of  LMG as fo l lows:  
T R = IP IQT 1 R( IxP x, IxQ x), 
w i th  R( IxP x, IxQ x) be ing  def ined  as: 
~xBy(P  x ^ Q y ~ R(x, y)) ~ VxVy(P x ^ P y .O  x = y) 
^ ~xVy(Q x ^ Q y. O x = y). 
Las t ly  the t rans la t ion  T is app l ied  to the operators  \[ \]i: and 
\[ \ ]2 in the fo l low ing  vay~ 
T \[ \ ] i  = ~VIWlx(V lyW(x ,  y)) ,  
T \[ \]2 = ~V~W~y(V~xW(x, y)), 
where  V and W are respect ive ly  the var iab les  of  the type of  noun 
phrases  and (b inary)  re la t ions  in pred icate  logic .  
Ava i l ing  ourse lves  of  the t rans la t ion  T thus  de f ined ,  some 
sample  sentences  (of LMG) w i l l  be t rans la ted  into the cor respond ing  
sentences  of  p red icate  logic .  
4 .11 T 2.11 = T ((the man) wa lk )  = T ((e man) wa lk )  
= ((T e T man)  T wa lk )  
= ( IP IQQIxP  x) Fman)  Fwa lk  = Fwa lk lXFmanX , 
4 .14 T 2.14 = T ( (every  man) \[love (some woman) \ ] l )  
= ( IP IQ~x(P  x D Q x) Fma n) 
( (~VIWIx(V IyW(x ,  y~( IP IQ~x(p  x A Q x) Fwoman)  G love ) 
= IQ~(FmanX ~ Q x ) Ix ( IQ~y(FwomanY A Q y) l yG love(X ,  y)) 
~X(FmanXO BY(FwomanY A G love(X '  Y) ) ) "  
As has been exempl i f ied  by the above t rans la t ions  we eas i ly  obta in :  
Lemma ~.3 Every  sentence  of  LMG as a language is t rans la ted  
by T into a fo rmula  of  f i r s t -o rder  pred icate  log ic  w i th  equa l i ty .  
Lemma h.4 The t rans la t ion  of  the theses  of  LMG as a log ic  are 
provab le  in pred icate  logic.  
The proof  is car r ied  out by induct ion  on the  length  of  the 
proof .  
The t reatment  of  the  bas is  w i l l  be i l lus t ra ted  by the fo l low ing  
example :  
4.~i T 3.02 ~ :T ~(a, b) ~ .(Bx)( ~(x, a )~ ~(x, h)) 
(x)(y)( c(x, a) ^ ~(x, b ) .D  E(x, y)): 
: Fb lXFaX ~ . ~ Fx(Fa lXFxx  ~ Fb lXFxX)~ 
VFx~Fy(Fa!xFxx  A Fa lxFyX.  ~ Fy lxFxx) :  
: Fb lXFa  ~ ? ~x(Fax  ~ FbX) ~ ~xVy(Fax  ~ Fay. ~ x = y). 
144 A. ISHIMOTO 
Here use is ~made of some theses o~ second-o~der predicate logic. 
All the other axioms, if t rans lated by T, wi l l  turn our to be 
provable in (higher-order)  predicate logic. The induct ion steps 
do not present any dif f icult ies.  
In view of Lemmas ~.3 and h.h we obtain, 
Corol lary h.5 If a sentence of LMG as language is a thesis of 
LMG as a logic, then its T - t ransform is provable in f i rst -order  pre- 
dicate logic with equality. 
It is remarked that the proof  of the T - t ransform of a sentence 
be longing to LMG as a language might involve formulas not necessa-  
r i ly be longing to f i rst -order predicate logic. 
Last ly we wish to state without proof  a lemma of fundamental  
importance,  namely, 
Lemma h.6 If the T- t ransform of a sentence be long ing  to LMG 
as a language is provable in f i rst -order  predicate logic with equal-  
ity, then the sentence is a thesis of LMG as a logic. 
This is proved syntact ica l ly  as wel l  as semant ica l ly  by the 
method employed in Ishimoto \[4\]. 
Combin ing Coro l la ry  ~.5 and Lemma h.6 we obtain, 
~L Theorem ~.7 For every sentence ~ of LMC as a language 
MG e iff T ~ is a thesis of f i rst -order predicate logic with equal-  
ty. 
In view of theorem h.7 as far as the logical  der ivabi l i ty  of 
some sentences of natural  language as speci f ied above is concerned,  
there is no di f ference between f i r s t -o rder  predicate logic and Les- 
n iewski 's  ontology. Use wil l  be made , it is hoped, of this fact 
in the var ious f ields ;e lated to the logical  analysis of natural  
language.
