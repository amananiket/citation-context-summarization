Abstract
At present, most biomedical Information
Retrieval and Extraction tools process ab-
stracts rather than full-text articles. The in-
creasing availability of full text will allow
more knowledge to be extracted with greater
reliability. To investigate the challenges of
full-text processing, we manually annotated
a corpus of cited articles from a Molecular
Interaction Map (Kohn, 1999).
Our analysis demonstrates the necessity of
full-text processing; identifies the article
sections where interactions are most com-
monly stated; and quantifies both the amount
of external knowledge required and the pro-
portion of interactions requiring multiple or
deeper inference steps. Further, it identi-
fies a range of NLP tools required, including:
identifying synonyms, and resolving coref-
erence and negated expressions. This is im-
portant guidance for researchers engineering
biomedical text processing systems.
1 Introduction
It is no longer feasible for biologists to keep abreast
of the vast quantity of biomedical literature. Even
keyword-based Information Retrieval (IR) over ab-
stracts retrieves too many articles to be individually
inspected. There is considerable interest in NLP sys-
tems that overcome this information bottleneck.
Most bioNLP systems have been applied to ab-
stracts only, due to their availability (Hirschman et
al., 2002). Unfortunately, the information in ab-
stracts is dense but limited. Full-text articles have
the advantage of providing more information and
repeating facts in different contexts, increasing the
likelihood of an imperfect system identifying them.
Full text contains explicit structure, e.g. sections
and captions, which can be exploited to improve
Information Extraction (IE) (Regev et al, 2002).
Previous work has investigated the importance of
extracting information from specific sections, e.g.
Schuemie et al (2004), but there has been little anal-
ysis of when the entire document is needed for accu-
rate knowledge extraction. For instance, extracting
a fact from the Results may require a synonym to be
resolved that is only mentioned in the Introduction.
External domain knowledge may also be required.
We investigated these issues by manually anno-
tating full-text passages that describe the functional
relationships between bio-entities summarised in a
Molecular Interaction Map (MIM). Our corpus
tracks the process Kohn (1999) followed in sum-
marising interactions for the mammalian cell MIM,
by identifying information required to infer facts,
which we call dependencies. We replicate the pro-
cess of manual curation and demonstrate the neces-
sity of full-text processing for fact extraction.
In the same annotation process we have identi-
fied NLP problems in these passages which must be
solved to identify the facts correctly including: syn-
onym and hyponym substitution, coreference reso-
lution, negation handling, and the incorporation of
knowledge from within the full text and the domain.
This allows us to report on the relative importance
of anaphora resolution and other tasks to the prob-
lem of biomedical fact extraction.
As well as serving as a dataset for future tool de-
velopment, our corpus is an excellent case study pro-
viding valuable guidance to developers of biomedi-
cal text mining and retrieval systems.

2 Biomedical NLP
Full-text articles are becoming increasingly avail-
able to NLP researchers, who have begun inves-
tigating how specific sections and structures can
be mined in various information extraction tasks.
Regev et al (2002) developed the first bioIR sys-
tem specifically focusing on limited text sections.
Their performance in the KDD Cup Challenge, pri-
marily using Figure legends, showed the importance
of considering document structure. Yu et al (2002)
showed that the Introduction defines the majority of
synonyms, while Schuemie et al (2004) and Shah et
al. (2003) showed that the Results and Methods are
the most and least informative, respectively. In con-
trast, Sinclair and Webber (2004) found the Methods
useful in assigning Gene Ontology codes to articles.
These section specific results highlight the infor-
mation loss resulting from restricting searches to in-
dividual sections, as sections often provide unique
information. Furthermore, facts appearing in dif-
ferent contexts across various sections, will be lost.
This redundancy has been used for passage valida-
tion and ranking (Clarke et al, 2001).
There are limited training resources for biomedi-
cal full-text systems. The majority of corpora con-
sist of abstracts annotated for bio-entity recognition
and Relationship Extraction, such as the GENIA
(Kim et al, 2003) and the BioCreAtIvE corpora.
However, due to the lack of full-text corpora, many
current systems only process abstracts (Ohta et al,
2006). Few biomedical corpora exist for other tasks,
such as coreference resolution (Castan?o et al, 2004;
Vlachos et al, 2006), and these are very small. In
this paper, we estimate the importance of these tasks
in bioNLP systems, which will help determine which
tasks system developers should focus effort on first.
Despite limited full-text training corpora, compe-
titions such as the Genomics track of TREC, require
systems to retrieve and rank passages from full text
that are relevant to question style queries.
3 Molecular Interaction Maps
Kohn (1999) constructed a Molecular Interaction
Map (MIM) based on literature describing 203 dif-
ferent interactions between bio-entities, such as pro-
teins and genes, in mammalian cells (Figure 1). In-
teractions in the MIM are represented as links be-
tween nodes labelled with the bio-entities. Each link
is associated with a description that summarises the
evidence for the interaction from the literature, in-
cluding citations. For example, Table 1 contains
the description passage for interaction M4 (on the
right of the Myc Box at grid reference C10 in Fig-
ure 1). Although MIM interactions may be men-
tioned in other articles, the articles cited by Kohn
(1999) document the main biomedical research lead-
ing to the discovery of these interactions.
172
c-Myc and pRb enhance transcription from the E-cadherin promoter in an AP2-dependent manner in epithelial cells (mechanism
unknown) (Batsche et al, 1998). Activation by pRb and c-Myc is not additive, suggesting that they act upon the same site,
thereby perhaps blocking the binding of an unidentified inhibitor. No c-Myc recognition element is required for activation of
the E-cadherin promoter by c-Myc. Max blocks transcriptional activation from the E-cadherin promoter by c-Myc, presumably
because it blocks the binding between c-Myc and AP2.
Table 1: MIM annotation M4
1. M4 Subfact: Activation of E-cadherin by pRb and c-Myc is not additive, suggesting they act on the
same site
a) However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which RB, Myc, and AP-2 cooperate to effect transcriptional activation of
E-cadherin requires further study. . . . the positive effects of RB and c-Myc were not additive. (Discussion)
Synonym: pRb equivalent to RB ? undefined
Synonym: c-Myc equivalent to Myc
b) The c-myc proto-oncogene, which encodes two amino-terminally distinct Myc proteins, acts as a transcription factor. (Intro)
Table 2: Example instances depending on synonym facts
In creating our corpus we have attempted to re-
verse engineer and document the MIM creation pro-
cess for many of the interactions in Kohn (1999). We
exhaustively traced and documented the process of
identifying passages from the cited full-text articles
that substantiate the MIM interactions. This allows
us to identify and quantify the amount of informa-
tion that is unavailable when systems are restricted
to abstracts.
4 Corpus Creation
The first stage of corpus creation involved obtaining
the full text of the articles cited in the MIM descrip-
tions. There are 262 articles cited in Kohn (1999),
and we have manually extracted the text from 218 of
them; we have abstracts for the other 44 which have
not been included in the analysis presented here.
Currently, the annotated part of the corpus con-
sists of passages from 101 full-text articles, support-
ing 95 of the 203 MIM descriptions. A biomedi-
cal expert exhaustively identified these passages by
manually reading each article several times. 30% of
these articles support multiple MIM descriptions and
so passages from these articles may appear multiple
times. We restricted the corpus to the cited articles
only. This allows us to quantify the need for external
resources, e.g. synonym lists and ontologies. The
corpus collection involved the following:
1. Each sentence in a MIM description is a called
a main fact.
2. For each main fact we annotated every passage
(instance) that the fact can be derived from.
These include direct statements of the fact and
passages the fact can be implied from.
3. Main facts are often complex sentences, com-
bining numerous facts from the article. Pas-
sages from which part of a fact can be de-
rived are also annotated as instances. A subfact
is then created to represent these partial facts.
This may be repeated for subfacts.
4. Many instances cannot be directly linked to
their corresponding fact, as they depend on ad-
ditional passages within the full text or exter-
nal domain knowledge. New facts are formed
to represent the dependency information ? syn-
onym and extra facts. Instances of these are an-
notated, and a link is added between the origi-
nal and dependency facts.
5. Each instance is annotated with its location
within the article. Linguistic phenomena, in-
cluding anaphora, cataphora, and negated ex-
pressions which must be resolved to derive the
fact are identified.
Tables 1 and 2 show an example of this pro-
cess. One of the main facts of interaction M4 (Ta-
ble 1) is Activation by pRb and c-Myc is not additive
. . . blocking the binding of an unidentified inhibitor.
An instance supporting part of this fact, the subfact
in Table 2 Activation of E-cadherin by pRb and c-
Myc is not additive . . . , 1.a), was identified. This in-
stance requires the resolution of two synonymy de-
pendencies, only one of which appears in the article.
173
2. E13 Main Fact: HDAC1 binds to the pocket proteins pRb, p107 and p130 and in turn is recruited to
E2F complexes on promoters
a) The experiments described above indicate that p107 and p130 can interact with HDAC1. We thus reasoned that they could
repress E2F activity by recruiting histone deacetylase activity to E2F containing promoters. (Results)
Extra: HDAC1 is a histone deacetylase
b) We have previously shown that Rb, the founding member of the pocket proteins family, represses E2F1 activity by recruiting
the histone deacetylase HDAC1. (Abstract)
Table 3: Example instances depending on extra facts
3. N4 Main fact: RPA2 binds XPA via the C-terminal region of RPA2
Mutant RPA that lacked the p34 C terminus failed to interact with XPA, whereas RPA containing the p70 mutant (Delta RS)
interacted with XPA (Fig. 2). (Results)
4. C9 Subfact: Cyclin D1 degraded rapidly by phosphorylation at threonine-286
Although ?free? or CDK4-bound cyclin D1 molecules are intrinsically unstable (t1/2< 30 min), a cyclin D1 mutant (T286A)
containing an alanine for threonine-286 substitution fails to undergo efficient polyubiquitination in an in vitro system or in
vivo, and it is markedly stabilized (t1/2 approximately 3.5 hr) when inducibly expressed in either quiescent or proliferating
mouse fibroblasts. (Abstract)
Table 4: Example instances with negated expressions
5 Dependencies
In our corpus, an instance of a fact may depend on
additional facts (dependencies) to allow the fact to
be derived from the original instance. Dependencies
may occur elsewhere in the document or may not be
mentioned at all. We consider two types of depen-
dencies: synonym facts and extra facts.
5.1 Synonym Facts
The frequent use of synonyms, abbreviations and
acronyms in biomedical text is a common source
of ambiguity that is often hard to resolve (Sehgal
et al, 2004). Furthermore, synonym lists are dif-
ficult to maintain in rapidly moving fields like bi-
ology (Lussier et al, 2006). There has been recent
interest in developing systems to identify and extract
these (Ao and Takagi, 2005; Okazaki and Anani-
adou, 2006).
In our corpus we group all of these synonyms, ab-
breviations, acronyms and other orthographic varia-
tions as synonym facts. For example, the synonyms
(1) E2F4, (2) E2F-4 and (3) E2F1-4 in our cor-
pus refer to the same entity E2F4, however term (3)
also includes the entities E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3.
In Table 2, an instance supporting subfact 1. is
shown in 1.a). The bio-entity pRb mentioned in the
subfact does not appear in this instance. Thus 1.a)
depends on knowing that pRb is equivalent to RB,
and so we form a new synonym fact. This synonym
is undefined in the article and cannot be assumed as
RB is also a homograph for the gene ruby (rb), ru-
bidium (Rb) and Robertsonian (Rb) translocations.
Instance 1 also depends on a second synonym ?
c-Myc and Myc are used interchangeably, where
the protein Myc is referred to by its gene name,
c-Myc. Metonymy is common in biology, and an
instance supporting this synonym fact was found in
the article, 1.b).
5.2 Extra Facts
Extra facts include all assertions (excluding syn-
onym definitions) which are necessary to make a
valid inference from an instance to a fact or subfact.
These extra facts must be found within the same ar-
ticle. Many extra facts are descriptions or classes
of bio-entities and hyponym relationships. Accord-
ing to Ne?dellec et al (2006), a clearer distinc-
tion between entities and their classes/descriptions
is needed in bioNLP corpora.
Example 2 in Table 3 is an instance which de-
pends on an extra fact, 2.b), to derive the main fact.
The class of proteins histone deacetylase
in sentence 2 must be linked to the specific pro-
tein HDAC1 in sentence 1, since the sortal anaphor
they in sentence 2 refers to the antecedents p107
and p130, and does not include HDAC1. This extra
fact is identified in the apposition the histone
deacetylase HDAC1 in instance 2.b).
174
5. C11b Subfact: p19ARF induces cell cycle arrest in a p53-dependent manner
INK4a/ARF is perhaps the second most commonly disrupted locus in cancer cells. It encodes two distinct tumor
suppressor proteins: p16INK4a, which inhibits the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein by cyclin D-
dependent kinases, and p19ARF, which stabilizes and activates p53 to promote either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. (Intro)
6. C36 Main fact: Cdc25C is phosphorylated by Cyclin B-cdk1
In this work, we examine the effect of phosphorylation on the human cdc25-C protein (Sadhu et al,1990). We show that this
protein is phosphorylated during mitosis in human cells and that this requires active cdc2-cyclin B. (Intro)
Table 5: Example instances with cataphora and event anaphora
6 Negated Expressions
To quantify the importance of lexical and logical
negations we have annotated each instance involv-
ing one or more negated expressions that must be
resolved to derive the fact. In biomedical literature,
negated expressions are commonly used to describe
an abnormal condition, such as a mutation, and its
resulting abnormal outcome, such as cancer, from
which the normal condition and outcome can be in-
ferred. This typically requires two or more negated
expressions to be processed simultaneously.
Table 4 shows examples of instances with negated
expressions. In the subject NP of instance 3, the lex-
ical negative form of RPA (Mutant RPA) is fol-
lowed directly by a logical negative detailing the
function it failed to perform. These two negative ex-
pressions support the positive in the main fact. This
implicit reporting of results expressed in terms of
negative experimental outcomes is very common in
molecular biology and genetics.
Example 4 requires external domain knowl-
edge. Firstly, the amino acid alanine cannot
be phosphorylated like threonine. Secondly,
polyubiquitination triggers a signal for a
protein (cyclin D1) to be degraded. Therefore
from this negated pair the positive fact from interac-
tion C9 can be inferred.
The context surrounding potential negative ex-
pressions must be analysed to determine if it is in-
deed a negative. For example, not all mutations re-
sult in negative outcomes ? the mutation of p70 in
instance 3 did not have a negative outcome.
7 Coreference Expressions
In biomedical literature, coreference expressions are
used to make abbreviated or indirect references to
bio-entities or events, and to provide additional in-
formation, such as more detailed descriptions.
To quantify the importance of coreference expres-
sions, instances in our corpus are annotated with
pronominal, sortal and event anaphoric, and cat-
aphoric expressions, including those extending be-
yond one sentence. Instances 4?6 in Tables 4?
5, each contain annotated pronominal or sortal
anaphoric expressions. Instance 5 also involves
a cataphoric expression, where suppressor
proteins refers to p16INK4a and p19ARF
Event anaphora refer to processes and are quite
common in biomedical text. We have annotated
these separately to pronominal and sortal anaphora.
Our event anaphora annotations are different to
Humphreys et al (1997). They associate sequential
events, while we only refer to the same event.
An example is shown in instance 6 (Table 5)
where the additional sortal anaphor complicates re-
solving the event anaphor. The third this refers
to the phosphorylation event, phosphorylated,
and not the protein cdc25-C like the second this.
8 Locating Facts
The key facts and results are generally repeated and
reworded in various contexts within an article. This
redundancy can be used in two ways to improve sys-
tem precision and recall. Firstly, the redundancy in-
creases the chance of an imperfect system identify-
ing at least one instance. Secondly, the redundancy
can be used for fact validation. By annotating every
instance that supports a fact we are able to measure
the degree of factual redundancy in full-text articles.
We have also annotated each instance with its lo-
cation within the article: which section (or structure
such as a title, heading or caption) it was contained
within and the number of the paragraph. Using this
data, we can evaluate the informativeness of each
section and structure for identifying interactions.
Using our detailed dependency annotations we
can also determine how many instances need addi-

portant full-text processing is.
9 Corpus Analysis
Having described the corpus annotation we can now
investigate various statistical properties of the data.
Table 7 shows the distribution of the various anno-
tated fact types within the corpus. There are a to-
tal of 728 different facts identified, with 556 (76%)
found within the documents. We have annotated
1916 individual passages as instances, totally 2429
sentences. There were 14 main facts that we found
no instances or subfact instances for.
The most redundancy occurs in main facts and
subfacts, with on average 3.35 and 4.76 instances
each respectively, whilst synonym facts have almost
no redundancy. Also, a large proportion of synonym
and extra facts, 60% and 43% respectively, do not
appear anywhere in the articles (Table 7).
This high level of redundancy in facts demon-
strates the significant advantages of processing full
text. However, the proportion of missing synonym

Subfact 36.9 ( 8.2) 26.7 (15.4)
Synonym 8.7 ( 2.9) 7.2 ( 4.3)
Extra 25.0 ( 0.0) 13.3 (10.9)
Table 8: Instances with (all found) dependencies
and extra facts shows the importance of external re-
sources, such as synonym lists, and tools for recog-
nising orthographic variants.
9.1 Locating Facts
Table 6 shows the percentage of instances identified
in particular locations within the articles. The best
sections for finding instances of facts and subfacts
were the Results and Discussion sections, whereas
synonym and extra facts were best found in the Ab-
stract, Introduction and Results. The later sections
of each article rarely contributed any instances. In-
terestingly, we did not find the Figure headings or
legends to be that informative for main facts. Figure
headings are restricted in length and thus are rarely
able to express main facts as well as subfacts.
The proportion of main facts and subfact in-
stances found in the abstract is quite small, further
demonstrating the value of full-text processing.
If we take into account the additional dependency
information, and restrict the instances to those fully
supported within a given section, the results drop
dramatically (those in parentheses in Table 6). In

Table 10: Breadth of instance dependencies
total, the number of instances drops to 39.4% and
40.6%, for main facts and subfacts, respectively.
This again demonstrates the need for full-text pro-
cessing, including the dependencies between facts
found in different sections of the article.
9.2 Dependencies
Our corpus represents each of the facts and subfacts
as a dependency graph of instances, each which in
turn may require support from other facts, including
synonym and extra facts.
Table 8 shows the percentage of instances which
depend on synonym and extra facts in our corpus.
46.8% of main fact instances depend on at least one
synonym fact, but only 10.9% of main fact instances
which depend on at least one synonym were com-
pletely resolved (i.e. all of the synonyms were found
as well). Interestingly, synonym and extra facts of-
ten required other synonym and extra facts.
Our corpus contains more synonym than extra fact
dependencies, however more extra facts were de-
fined in the articles. The large proportion of main
facts and subfacts depending on synonyms and extra
facts demonstrates the importance of automatically
extracting this information from full text.
Since the inference from an instance to a fact may
depend on other facts, long chains of dependencies
may occur, all of which would need to be resolved
before a main fact could be derived from the text.
Expressions Instances
Negated 4.3
Anaphora 13.2
Event Anaphora 6.6
Cataphora 2.7
Table 11: Distribution of annotated expressions
Table 9 shows the distribution of maximum chain
depth in our dependency graphs. The maximum
depth is predominately less than 3. Table 10 shows
the distribution of the breadth of dependency graphs.
Again, most instances are supported by fewer than 3
dependency chains. Most instances depend on some
other information, but luckily, a large proportion of
those only require information from a small number
of other facts. However, given that these facts could
occur anywhere within the full text, extracting them
is still a very challenging task.
9.3 Negated & Coreference Expressions
Table 11 shows the percentage of instances anno-
tated with negated, anaphoric and cataphoric ex-
pressions in our corpus. We have separated event
anaphora from pronominal and sortal anaphora.
There are fewer cataphoric and negated expressions
than anaphoric expressions. Therefore, we would
expect the greatest improvement when systems in-
corporate anaphora resolution components, and lit-
tle improvement from cataphoric and negated ex-
pression analysis. However, negated expressions
provide valuable information regarding experimen-
tal conditions and outcomes, and thus may be ap-
propriate for specific extraction tasks.
10 Conclusion
This paper describes a corpus documenting the man-
ual identification of facts from full-text articles by
biomedical researchers. The corpus consists of arti-
cles cited in a Molecular Interaction Map developed
by Kohn (1999). Each fact can be derived from one
or more passages from the citations. Each of these
instances was annotated with their location in the
article and whether they contained coreference or
negated expressions. Each instance was also linked
with other information, including synonyms and ex-
tra knowledge, that was required to derive the partic-
ular interaction. The annotation task was quite com-
177
plex and as future work we will increase the relia-
bility of our corpus by including the annotations of
other domain experts using our guidelines, and use
this resource for tool development. The guidelines
and corpus will be made publicly available.
Our corpus analysis demonstrates that full-text
analysis is crucial for exploiting biomedical litera-
ture. Less than 20% of fact instances we identified
were contained in the abstract. Analysing sections
in isolation reduced the number of supported facts
by 60%. We also showed that many instances were
dependent on a significant amount of other informa-
tion, both within and outside the article. Finally, we
showed the potential impact of various NLP compo-
nents such as anaphora resolution systems.
This work provides important empirical guidance
for developers of biomedical text mining systems.
