ABSTRACT 
This paper presents SPQR (Selectional Pat-  
tern Queries and Responses), a module of the 
PUNDIT text-processing system designed to facili- 
tate the acquisition of domain-specific semantic 
information, and to improve the accuracy and 
efficiency of the parser. SPQR operates by 
interactively and incrementally collecting informa- 
tion about the semantic acceptabil ity of certain 
lexical co-occurrence patterns (e.g., subject-verb- 
object) found in partial ly constructed parses. The 
module has proved to be a valuable tool for port- 
ing PUNDIT to new domains and acquiring essen- 
tial semantic information about the domains. 
Preliminary results also indicate that SPQR 
causes a threefold reduction in the number of 
parses found, and about a 40~ reduction in total 
parsing time. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
A major concern in designing a natural- 
language system is portability: It is advantageous 
to design a system in such a way that it can be 
ported to new domains with a minimum of effort. 
The level of effort required for such a port is con- 
siderably simplified if the system features a high 
degree of modularity. For example, if the 
domain-independent and domain-specific com- 
ponents of a system are clearly factored, only the 
domain-specific knowledge bases need be changed 
when porting to a new domain. Even if a system 
demonstrates such separation, however, the prob- 
lem remains of acquiring this domain-specific

knowledge. 
One obvious benefit of acquiring domain- 
specific semantic information is rejecting parses 
generated by the syntactic component which are 
semantically anomalous. Using domain knowledge 
to rule out semantically anomalous parses is espe- 
cially important when parsing with large, broad- 
coverage grammars such as ours: Our Prolog 
implementation of Restriction Grammar 
~-Iirschman1982,Hirschman1985\] includes about 
100 grammar rules and 75 restrictions, and is 
based on Sager's Linguistic String Grammar 
\[Sager1981\]. It also includes a full treatment of 
sentential fragments and telegraphic message 
style. As a result of this extended coverage, many 
sentences receive numerous yntactic analyses. A 
majority of these analyses, however, are incorrect 
because they violate some semantic onstraint. 
Let us take as an example the sentence High 
lsbe oil temperatsre belle~ed contribstor to 
snlt failure. Two of the parses for this sentence 
could be paraphrased as: 
(1) The high lube oil temperature believed the 
contributor to the unit failure. 
(2) The high lube oil temperature was believed 
to be a contributor to the unit failure. 
but our knowledge of the domain (and common 
sense) tells us that  the first parse is wrong, since 
temperatures cannot hold beliefs. 
It is only because of this semantic informa- 
tion that we know that parse (2) is correct, and 
that parse (1) is not, since we cannot rule out 
parse (1) on syntactic grounds alone. In fact, our 
grammar generates the incorrect parse before the 
correct one, since it produces full assertion parses 
before fragment parses. If the syntactic com- 
ponent has access to semantic knowledge, 
49 
however, many incorrect parses such as (1) will 
never be generated. 
How then can we collect the necessary 
semantic information about a domain? One tradi- 
tional approach involves analysing a corpus of 
texts by hand, or perhaps even simply relying on 
one's intuitive knowledge of the domain in order 
to gather information about what relations can 
hold among domain entities. Several obvious 
drawbacks to these approaches are that  they are 
time-consuming, error-prone, and incomplete. A 
more robust approach would be to use (semi-) 
automated tools designed to collect such informa- 
tion by cataloguing selectional patterns found in 
correct parses of sentences. 
However, our reasoning appears circular: 
The desired domain-specific information can only 
be obtained from analyses of correctly parsed sen- 
tences, but our goal is to restrict the parser to 
these correct analyses precisely by using this 
domain knowledge. In the example above, we 
need the semantic knowledge to rule out the first 
parse; but it is only by knowing that this parse is 
semantically anomalous that  we can obtain the 
selectional information about the domain. 
One way to avoid this circularity is to 
bootstrap into a state of increasingly complete 
domain knowledge. We have implemented in 
SPQR such a bootstrapping process by incremen- 
tally collecting and ~toring domaln-specific data 
gathered through interaction with the user. The 
data are in the form of selectlonal constraints 
expressed as allowable and unallowable syntactic 
co-occurrence patterns. All the data collected 
while parsing a set of sentences can then be used 
to help guide the parser to correct analyses and to 
decrease the search space traversed uring future 
parsing. As the system's semantic knowledge 
becomes increasingly rich, we can expect it to 
demonstrate some measure of learning, since it will 
produce fewer incorrect analyses and present fewer 
queries to the user about the validity of syntactic 
patterns. 
A number of systems have been developed to 
assist the user in acquiring domaln-speclfic 
knowledge, including TELI ~allard1986\], TEAM 
\[Cross1083\], KLAUS ~-Iendrix1980\], ASK \[Thomp- 
son1983\] and \[Thompson1985\], TQA paN-  
erau1985\] and IRACQ ~V\[oser1984,Ayuso1987\]. 
Related work has also been reported in \[Tom- 
ita1984\], as well as in \[Grishman1986\] and 
~-Iirschman1986a\]. The work described here differs 
from these previous efforts in several ways: 1 
? Since PUNDIT is not a natural- language 
interface or a database front end, but rather 
a full text-processing system, sentences 
analysed by PUNDIT are taken from cor- 
puses of naturally-occurring texts. The 
semantic information gathered is therefore 
empirically or statistically based, and not 
derived from sentences generated by a user. 
? The ellcltation of information from the user 
follows a highly structured, data-driven 
approach, yielding results which should be 
more reproducible and consistent among 
users. 
? IV\[any systems have a clearly defined 
knowledge-acquisltlon phase which must be 
completed before the system can be 
effectively used or tested. We have chosen 
instead to adopt a paradigm of incremental 
knowledge acquisition. 
Our incremental approach is based on the 
assumption that gathering complete knowledge 
about domain is an unattainable ideal, especially 
for a system which performs in-depth analysis of 
texts written in technical sublanguages: Even if 
one could somehow be assured of acquiring all con- 
ceivable knowledge about a domain, the system's 
omniscience would be transient, since the technical 
fields themselves are constantly changing, and 
thus require modifications to one's knowledge base. 
An incremental acquisition method therefore 
allows us to start  from an essentially empty 
knowledge base. Each sentence parsed can add 
inforr~.atlon about the domain, and the system 
thereby effectively bootstraps itself until its 
knowledge about the selectional patterns in a 
domain approaches completeness. 
In this paper we present SPQR, the com- 
ponent of the PUNDIT 2 text-understanding system 
which is designed to acquire domain-specific selec- 
tional information ~ang1987\]. We present in Sec- 
tion 2 the methodology we have adopted to collect 
and use selectional patterns, and then give in Sec- 
tion 3 some examples of the operation of our

module. We conclude by presenting some experi- 
mental results and discussing some future plans to 
extend the module. 
SPQR has been used in analysing texts in 
three domains: casualty reports (CASREPs) deal- 
ing with mechanical failures of starting air 
eompreuorJ (SACs are a component of a ship's 
engine), queries to a Navy ships database, and 
Navy sighting messages (RAINFORMs). 
2. METHODOLOGY 
The essential feature of our parser which 
facilitates the collecting of syntactic patterns is 
the INTERMEDIATE SYNTACTIC REPRESENTATION 
(ISR) produced by the syntactic analyser. The 
ISR is the result of regularizing the surface syntac- 
tic structure into a canonical form of operators 
and arguments. Since there are only a limited 
number of structures which can appear in an ISR, 
we have been able to write a program to analyze 
the ISR and examine the syntactic patterns as 
they are generated.

\[nvar(\[sac,singular,_\])\], 
adj(\[pastpart,break\])\]\] 
Figure 1: ISR for the sentence 
The engi,eer epaired the broke, sac 
A brief note about the implementation: Since 
the ISR is represented as a Prolog llst, the pro- 
gram which analyzes it was written as a definite- 
clause grammar and has the flavor of a small 
parser. As a sample ISR, we present in Figure 1 
the regularized representation of the obvious parse 
for the sentence The englneer epaired the bro- 
ke~ mac (pretty-printed for clarity). At the top 
level, the ISR consists of the main verb (preceded 
by its tense operators), followed by its subject and 
object. The ISR of a noun phrase contains first 
the determiner (labelled TPOS), then the head 
noun, (the label NVAR stands for "noun or vari- 
ant"), and finally any nominal modifiers. Note 
that part of the regularisation performed by the 
ISR is morphological, since the actual lexical items 
appearing in the ISR are represented by their root 
forms. Hence broken in the input sentence is reg- 
ularized to break in the ISR, and rep41red in the 
input sentence appears in the ISR simply as 
repair. 
SPQR is invoked by two restrictions which 
are called after the BNF grammar has assembled 
a complete NP (and constructed the ISR for that 
NP), and after it has assembled a complete sen- 
tence (and constructed its ISR). The program 
operates by presenting to the user a syntactic pat- 
tern (either a head-modifier pattern or a 
predicate-argument pattern) found in the ISR, and 
querying hlm/her about the acceptabil ity of that 
pattern. 
For each of the basic types of patterns which 
the program currently generates, the chart in 
Table 1 shows that pattern's components, an 
example of that pattern, and a sentence in which 
the pattern occurs. When presented with a syn- 
tactic pattern such as those in the chart in Table 
1, the user can respond to the query in one of two 
ways, depending on the semantic compatibil ity of 
the predicate and arguments (e.g., in the case of 
an SVO pattern) or of the head and modifiers (e.g., 
for an ADJ pattern) contained in the pattern. If 
the pattern describes a relationship that can be 
said to hold among domain entitles (i.e., if the 
pattern occurs in the sublanguage), the user 
accepts the pattern, thereby classifying it as good. 
The analysis of the ISR and the parsing of the 
sentence are then allowed to continue. If, how- 
ever, the pattern describes a relationship among 
domain entities that is not consistent with the 
user's domain knowledge or with his/her prag- 
matic knowledge (i.e., if the pattern cannot or 
does not occur in the sublanguage) the user rejects 
it, thereby classifying it as bad, and signalling an 
incorrect parse. This response causes the restric- 
tion which checks selection to fail, and as a result, 
the parse under construction is immediately failed, 
and the parser backtracks. 
As the user classifies these co-occurrence pat- 
terns into good patterne and bad patterns, they 
are stored in a pattern database which is con- 
suited before any query to the user is made. Thus, 
once a pattern has been classified as good or bad, 
the user is not asked to classify it again. If a pat- 
tern previously classified as bad by the user is 
encountered in the course of analyzing the ISR, 
SPQR consults the database, recognizes that the 
pattern is bad, and automatically fails the parse 
being assembled. Similarly, if a pattern previously

recorded as good is encountered, SPQR will recog- 
nine that the pattern is good simply by consulting 
the database, and allow the parsing to proceed. 
The selectional mechanism as described so 
far deals only with lexical patterns (i.e., patterns 
involving specific lexical items appearing in the 
lexicon). However, we have implemented a 
method of generalising these patterns by using 
information taken from the domain isa 
(generallzation/specialization) hierarchy to con- 
struct semantic class patterns from the lexical 
patterns. After deciding whether a given pattern 
is good or bad, the user is asked if the relation 
described by the pattern can be generalized. In 
presenting this second query, SPQR shows the user 
all the super-concepts of each word appearing in 
the pattern, and asks for the most general super- 
concept(s), if any, for which the relation holds. 
Let us take as an example the noun-noun 
pattern generated by the compound nominal oll 
pressure. ~Vhlle parsing a sentence containing 
this expression, the user would accept the noun- 
noun pattern \[oil, presexre\]. The program will 
then show the user in hierarchically ascending 
order all the generalizations for oil (fllld, 
ph~aieal_obieet, and root_eo~eept), and all the 
generalizations for premesre (mcalar_qxa~tlty, 
obiect_property, abatract_obyect, and again 
root_?o~cept). The user can then identify which 
of those super-concepts of oll and preuxre can 
form a semantically acceptable compound nomi- 
nal. In this case, the correct generalization would 
be \[fluid, aealar_qxantity\], because 
? The fluids in the domain are oil, air, and 
water; the scalar quantities are pressure and 
temperature; and it is consistent with the 
domain to speak of the pressure and the 
temperature of oil, air, and water. 
? We cannot generalize higher than fluid since 
it would be semantically anomalous to speak 
of "physical_object pressure" for every 
phyaieal_ob~eet in the domain (e.g., one 
52 
would not speak of eonneetlng_pin pres- 
sure or gearboz pressure). 
? We cannot generalize higher than pressure 
since aKape is also an objeet_propertT, and 
it would be infelicitous to speak of oll 
sKape. 
As with the lexical-level patterns, the user's 
generalizations are stored for reference in evaluat-  
ing patterns generated by other sentences. The 
obvious advantage of storing not just lexical pat-  
terns but also semantic patterns is the broader 
coverage of the latter: Knowing that  the semantic 
class pattern ~nld, pressure\] is semantically 
acceptable provides much more information than 
knowing only that  the lexical pattern loll, pres-  
sure\] is good. 
g. SOME (S IMPL IF IED)  E IAMPLES 
As we mentioned earlier, multiple syntactic 
analyses which can only be disamhiguated by 
using semantic information abound in our corpuses 
because of the telegraphic and fragmentary nature 
of our texts. This ambiguity has two principal 
causes: 
(1) A sentence which parses correctly as a frag- 
ment can often be parsed as a full assertion 
as well. 
(2) Determiners are often omitted from our sen- 
tences, thus making it difficult to establish 
NP boundaries. 
Since such syntactical ly degenerate sentences 
will generally contain fewer syntactic markers 
than full, non-telegraphic English sentences, they 
are characterized by correspondingly greater 
ambiguity. We now present an example of the use 
of selection to rule out a semantically anomalous 
assertion parse in favor of a correct fragment 
reading, s Consider the sentence Loss of second 
installed sac. In the correct analysis, the sen- 
tence is parsed is a noun string fragment; however, 
another reading is available in which the sentence 
is analyzed as a full assertion, with loss of second 
as the subject, installed as main verb, and sac as 
direct object. A paraphrase of this parse might be 
The loss of a second installed the sac. But this 
analysis is semantically completely anomalous for 
several reasons, but most notably because it 
tin this simplified explanation, we present only the svo 
pattern. In actual parsing of this sentence, however, addition- 
al patterns would be generated from the NP level. 
makes no sense to say that  the loss of a second 
can cause a sac (or anything else) to be installed. 
Since our parser tries assertion parses before frag- 
ment parses, the incorrect reading of this sentence 
is produced first. In generating the assertion 
parse, the parser encounters the svo  pattern \[loss, 
install, sae\], and queries the user as follows: 
-SVO-  pat tern  : l oss  ins ta l l  sac  
This query asks if a loss can install a sac in this 
domain, or if a domain expert would ever speak of 
a loss installing a sac. Since it is nonsensical to 
speak of a loss installing a sac, the correct 
response to SPQR's query in this case is to reject 
the pattern,  causing the assertion parse to fail 
after the module elicits the appropr iate generali- 
zations of the pattern.  
In order to generalize the pattern,  the user is 
shown all the the super-ordinates of toes and sac, 
and asked to generalize the anomalous SVO pat- 
tern lion, install, sae\]. The super-concepts of 
loss are /allure, problem, scent, abstract_object, 
and root_concept. The super-concepts of sac are 
unit, meehanical_dewiee, system_component, 
pAysleal_objeet, and root_concept. Since noth- 
ing that  is an abstract  object can install anything 
at all, the correct generalization would be 
\[abstract_object, install, root_concept\]. Since 
the user's response to the original prompt labelled 
the pattern as bad, the assertion parse under con- 
struction then fails, and the parser backtracks. 
An especially convoluted example of 
assertion-fragment ambiguity is found in the sen- 
tence Ezperieneed frequent /oases of pressure 
following clutch engage command. In the 
correct reading (which is again a fragment), the 
subject is elided, the main verb is effiperlenesd, 
and the direct object is the frequent losses of 
pressure (in this parse, following eluteA engage 
command functions as a sentence adjunct, with 
clutch engage command as a compound nominal). 
However, in another reading generated by our 
parser, the subject is experienced frequent losses 
of pressure following clutch, the main verb is 
engage, and command is the direct object. This 
reading would fail selection at the SVO level (if not 
sooner) because the svo pattern \[loss, engage,

4. EXPERIMENTAL  RESULTS 
The experimental results we present here are 
based on a sample of 31 sentences from one of our 
CASREP corpuses, each of which was parsed with 
and without invoking SPQR. We compare results 
obtained without using the selectional module to 
results obtained with the parser set to query the 
user about selectional patterns (starting from an 
empty pattern database).  The chart in Table 2 
summarizes the results for the 31 sentences. 
54 
One of the statistics presented in Table 2 is 
the SEARCH FOCUS, which is a measure of the 
efficiency of the parser in either reaching the 
correct parse of a sentence, or generating all possi- 
ble parses. It is equal to the ratio of the number of 
nodes attached to the parse tree in the course of 
parsing (and possibly detached upon backtrack-  
ing), 4 to the number of nodes in the completed, 
correct parse tree. Thus a search focus of 1.0 in 
reaching the correct parse would indicate that  for 
every (branching) grammar  rule tried, the first 
option was the correct one, or, in other words, 
that  the parser had never backtracked. 
The first line of the Table 2 chart deserves 
some explanation. One might wonder how a 
mechanism designed in part  to rule oat parses 
can actually prodsce  a correct analysis for a sen- 
tence where none had been available without the 
module. The explanation is the COMMITTED DIS- 
JUNCTION mechanism we have implemented in our 
parser in order to reduce the (often spurious) 
ambiguity caused by allowing both full sentential 
and fragmentary readings. This pruning of the 
search space is most apparent  when the parser is 
turned loose and set to generate all possible 
parses, as it was when we gathered the statistics 
summarized above. Recall that  our parser tries 
full assertion parses before fragment parses. The 
effect of the COMMITTED DISJUNCTION mechanism 
is to commit the parser to produce only assertion 
parses (and no fragment parses) if an assertion 
parse is found. Fragment parses are tried only if 
no assertion parse is available. Thus no fragment 
reading will ever be generated for a sentence 
which can be analysed as both an assertion and a 
fragment. This has proved to be the correct 
behavior in a major i ty of the texts we have 
analysed. However, a fragment which can also be 
analysed as an assertion will never receive a 
correct parse unless all assertion parses can be 
blocked using selection. Thus it is possible for 
selection to make available a correct syntactic 
analysis where none would be available without 
selection. 
5. FUTURE PLANS 
Our ult imate goal is to integrate SPQR with 
the domain model and the semantic component 
that  maps syntactic constituents into predicates 
4Another way to interpret this figure is that it 
represents the number of grammar rules tried. 
and associated thematic roles. At present, these 
components are developed independently. Our 
aim is to link these components in order to main- 
tain consistency and faci l itate updating the sys- 
tem. For example, if semantic rules exist to fill 
thematic roles of a given predicate, we should be 
able to derlwe a set of "surface" selectional pat- 
terns consistent with the underlying semantics. 
Similarly, given a set of selectional patterns, we 
should be able to suggest a (set of) semantic 
rule(s) consistent with the observed selection. In 
addition, if a word encountered in parsing is not 
represented in the domain model, it should be pos- 
sible to suggest where the word should fit in the 
model, based on similarity to previously observed 
patterns. If, for example, in the CASREP domain, 
we encounter a sentence such as The widget 
broke, but widgets do not appear  in our domain 
model, the system would check for any patterns of 
the form iX, break\]; if it finds such a pattern,  e.g., 
\[machine_part, break\], the system can then sug- 
gest that  widget be classified as a machine part  in 
the domain model. If the user concurs, widget 
would then automatical ly be entered into the 
model. 
In addition to the above work, which is 
already underway, we plan to improve the user 
interface, to measure the rate at which selectlonal 
patterns are acquired, and to investigate the use 
of selectio~al patterns in developing a weighting 
algorithm based on frequency of occurrence in the 
domain. 
5.1.  The  User  In ter faee  
In the current implementation, the questions 
which the program asks the user are phrased in 
terms of grammatica l  categories, and are thus 
tailored to users who know what is meant by such 
terms as "svo"  and "noun-noun compounds". As 
a result, only linguists can be reasonably expected 
to make sense of the questions and provide mean- 
ingful answers. Our intended users, however, are 
not linguists, but rather domain experts who will 
know what can and cannot be said in the sub- 
language, but who cannot be expected to reason in 
terms of grammatica l  categories. Deciding how to 
phrase questions designed to elicit the desired 
information is a difficult problem. Our first 
at tempt will be to paraphrase the pattern.  E.g., 
for the svo pattern \[Iou t instal\[, aac\], the query 
to the user would be something like "Can a loss 
install a sac?". 
SS 
We are also examining what kind of 
knowledge the user must draw upon in order to 
answer the system's questions. Users' answers are 
usually based on a combination of commonsense 
knowledge (e.g., losses cannot install things) and 
domain-specific information. In certain cases, 
however, the user can be called upon to make fine 
linguistic distinctions. For example, in the sen- 
tence Sac disengaged immediately after alarm, 
does the adverb immediately modify the verb 
dimengaged, or the prepositional phrase after 
alarm? Most users, and even trained linguists 
familiar with the domain, find it difficult to pro- 
vide definitive answers to such questions, because 
there is often no definitively correct answer. In 
this case, the adverbial attachment would seem to 
be genuinely ambiguous. It would be helpful to 
recognise patterns which a user cannot be reason- 
ably expected to pass judgment on, and not gen- 
erate queries about these, perhaps allowing them 
to succeed by default. 
8.2 .  Measur ing  the  System's  Learn ing  
As more sentences are parsed and more pat- 
terns are classified, we can expect the system to 
grow "smarter" in the sense that it will ask the 
user increasingly fewer questions. Eventually, the 
system should reach a state of reasonably com- 
plete domain knowledge, at which time few 
unknown patterns would be encountered, and the 
user would almost never be queried. We do not 
know how many sentences SPQR would have to 
examine before attaining such a plateau, but an 
estimate would be in the range of 500 to 1000 
\[Grishman1986\]. We plan to measure the decrease 
in the frequency of queries to the user as a func- 
tion of the number of sentences parsed and the 
number of patterns collected in order to evaluate 
the system's learning. This will enable us to 
determine the feasibility of using this technique to 
bootstrap into a new domain. 
8.3 .  Pre ference-Based  Pars ing  
A long-term goal is to implement a parsing 
algorithm based on preference rather than on the 
current success/failure paradigm. This would 
allow the system to use statistical information on 
the frequency of observed patterns as one factor in 
weighting. Frequently occurring patterns would 
be assigned greater weight than unknown pat- 
terns, and bad patterns would detract from the 
overall weighting. This would allow the system to 
make intelligent "guesses" about parsing without 
constantly querying the user.
