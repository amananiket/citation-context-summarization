We propose a new method of classifying 
documents into categories. We define for 
each category a finite mixture model based 
on soft clustering of words. We treat the 
problem of classifying documents as that 
of conducting statistical hypothesis testing 
over finite mixture models, and employ the 
EM algorithm to efficiently estimate pa- 
rameters in a finite mixture model. Exper- 
imental results indicate that our method 
outperforms existing methods. 
1 In t roduct ion  
We are concerned here with the issue of classifying 
documents into categories. More precisely, we begin 
with a number of categories (e.g., 'tennis, soccer, 
skiing'), each already containing certain documents. 
Our goal is to determine into which categories newly 
given documents ought to be assigned, and to do so 
on the basis of the distribution of each document's 
words. 1 
Many methods have been proposed to address 
this issue, and a number of them have proved to 
be quite effective (e.g.,(Apte, Damerau, and Weiss, 
1994; Cohen and Singer, 1996; Lewis, 1992; Lewis 
and Ringuette, 1994; Lewis et al, 1996; Schutze, 
Hull, and Pedersen, 1995; Yang and Chute, 1994)). 
The simple method of conducting hypothesis testing 
over word-based istributions in categories (defined 
in Section 2) is not efficient in storage and suffers 
from the data sparseness problem, i.e., the number 
of parameters in the distributions is large and the 
data size is not sufficiently large for accurately es- 
timating them. In order to address this difficulty, 
(Guthrie, Walker, and Guthrie, 1994) have proposed 
using distributions based on what we refer to as hard 
1A related issue is the retrieval, from a data base, of 
documents which are relevant to a given query (pseudo- 
document) (e.g.,(Deerwester et al, 1990; Fuhr, 1989; 
Robertson and Jones, 1976; Salton and McGill, 1983; 
Wong and Yao, 1989)). 
clustering of words, i.e., in which a word is assigned 
to a single cluster and words in the same cluster are 
treated uniformly. The use of hard clustering might, 
however, degrade classification results, since the dis- 
tributions it employs are not always precise enough 
for representing the differences between categories. 
We propose here to employ soft chsterinf,  i.e., 
a word can be assigned to several different clusters 
and each cluster is characterized by a specific word 
probability distribution. We define for each cate- 
gory a finite mixture model, which is a linear com- 
bination of the word probability distributions of the 
clusters. We thereby treat the problem of classify- 
ing documents as that of conducting statistical hy- 
pothesis testing over finite mixture models. In or- 
der to accomplish ypothesis testing, we employ the 
EM algorithm to efficiently and approximately cal- 
culate from training data the maximum likelihood 
estimates of parameters in a finite mixture model. 
Our method overcomes the major drawbacks of 
the method using word-based istributions and the 
method based on hard clustering, while retaining 
their merits; it in fact includes those two methods 
as special cases. Experimental results indicate that 
our method outperforrrLs them. 
Although the finite mixture model has already 
been used elsewhere in natural language processing 
(e.g. (Jelinek and Mercer, 1980; Pereira, Tishby, 
and Lee, 1993)), this is the first work, to the best of 
knowledge, that uses it in the context of document 
classification. 
2 P rev ious  Work  
Word-based  method 
A simple approach to document classification is to 
view this problem as that of conducting hypothesis 
testing over word-based istributions. In this paper, 
we refer to this approach as the word-based method 
(hereafter, eferred to as WBM). 
2We borrow from (Pereira, Tishby, and Lee, 1993) 
the terms hard clustering and soft clustering, which were 
used there in a different ask. 
39 
Letting W denote a vocabulary (a set of words), 
and w denote a random variable representing any 
word in it, for each category ci (i = 1, . . . ,n) ,  we 
define its word-based distribution P(wIci) as a his- 
togram type of distribution over W. (The num- 
ber of free parameters of such a distribution is thus 
I W\[ -  1). WBM then views a document as a sequence 
of words: 
d = Wl , ' ' "  , W N (1) 
and assumes that each word is generated indepen- 
dently according to a probability distribution of a 
category. It then calculates the probability of a doc- 
ument with respect o a category as 
N 
P(dlc,) = P(w,, . . . ,~Nle,)  = 1-~ P(w, lc,), (2) 
t= l  
and classifies the document into that category for 
which the calculated probability is the largest. We 
should note here that a document's probability with 
respect o each category is equivMent o the likeli- 
hood of each category with respect o the document, 
and to classify the document into the category for 
which it has the largest probability is equivalent to 
classifying it into the category having the largest 
likelihood with respect o it. Hereafter, we will use 
only the term likelihood and denote it as L(dlci). 
Notice that in practice the parameters in a dis- 
tribution must be estimated from training data. In 
the case of WBM, the number of parameters is large; 
the training data size, however, is usually not suffi- 
ciently large for accurately estimating them. This 
is the data .sparseness problem that so often stands 
in the way of reliable statistical language processing 
(e.g.(Gale and Church, 1990)). Moreover, the num- 
ber of parameters in word-based istributions i too 
large to be efficiently stored. 
Method based on hard clustering 
In order to address the above difficulty, Guthrie 
et.al, have proposed a method based on hard cluster- 
ing of words (Guthrie, Walker, and Guthrie, 1994) 
(hereafter we will refer to this method as HCM). Let 
cl,...,c,~ be categories. HCM first conducts hard 
clustering of words. Specifically, it (a) defines a vo- 
cabulary as a set of words W and defines as clusters 
its subsets kl , . . - ,k,n satisfying t3~=xk j = W and 
ki fq k j  = 0 (i  j )  (i.e., each word is assigned only 
to a single cluster); and (b) treats uniformly all the 
words assigned to the same cluster. HCM then de- 
fines for each category ci a distribution of the clus- 
ters P(kj \[ci) (j = 1 , . . . ,m) .  It replaces each word 
wt in the document with the cluster kt to which it 
belongs (t = 1,--., N). It assumes that a cluster kt 
is distributed according to P(kj\[ci) and calculates 
the likelihood of each category ci with respect to 
the document by 
N 
L(dle,) -- L (k l , . . . ,  kNlci) = H e(k ,  le,). 
t= l

There are any number of ways to create clusters in 
hard clustering, but the method employed is crucial 
to the accuracy of document classification. Guthrie 
et. al. have devised a way suitable to documentation 
classification. Suppose that there are two categories 
cl ='tennis' and c2='soccer,' and we obtain from the 
training data (previously classified documents) the 
frequencies of words in each category, such as those 
in Tab. 1. Letting L and M be given positive inte- 
gers, HCM creates three clusters: kl, k2 and k3, in 
which kl contains those words which are among the 
L most frequent words in cl, and not among the M 
most frequent in c2; k2 contains those words which 
are among the L most frequent words in cs, and 
not among the M most frequent in Cl; and k3 con- 
tains all remaining words (see Tab. 2). HCM then 
counts the frequencies of clusters in each category 
(see Tab. 3) and estimates the probabilities of clus- 
ters being in each category (see Tab. 4). 3 Suppose 
that a newly given document, like d in Fig. i, is to 
be classified. HCM cMculates the likelihood values 
3We calculate the probabilities here by using the so- 
called expected likelihood estimator (Gale and Church, 
1990): 
. f (k j lc ,  ) + 0.5 , 
P(k3lc~) = f -~- -~-~ x m (4) 
where f(kjlci ) is the frequency of the cluster kj in ci, 
f(ci) is the total frequency of clusters in cl, and m is the 
total number of clusters.

L(dlCl ) and L(dlc2) according to Eq. (3). (Tab. 5 
shows the logarithms of the resulting likelihood val- 
ues.) It then classifies d into cs, as log s L(dlcs ) is 
larger than log s L(dlc 1). 
d = kick, goal, goal, ball

log s L(d\]cs)

HCM can handle the data sparseness problem 
quite well. By assigning words to clusters, it can 
drastically reduce the number of parameters to be 
estimated. It can also save space for storing knowl- 
edge. We argue, however, that the use of hard clus- 
tering still has the following two problems: 
1. HCM cannot assign a word ?0 more than one 
cluster at a time. Suppose that there is another 
category c3 = 'skiing' in which the word 'ball' 
does not appear, i.e., 'ball' will be indicative of 
both cl and c2, but not cs. If we could assign 
'ball' to both kt and k2, the likelihood value for 
classifying a document containing that word to 
cl or c2 would become larger, and that for clas- 
sifying it into c3 would become smaller. HCM, 
however, cannot do that. 
2. HCM cannot make the best use of information 
about the differences among the frequencies of 
words assigned to an individual cluster. For ex- 
ample, it treats 'racket' and 'shot' uniformly be- 
cause they are assigned to the same cluster kt 
(see Tab. 5). 'Racket' may, however, be more 
indicative of Cl than 'shot,' because it appears 
more frequently in cl than 'shot.' HCM fails 
to utilize this information. This problem will 
become more serious when the values L and M 
in word clustering are large, which renders the 
clustering itself relatively meaningless. 
From the perspective of number of parameters, 
HCM employs models having very few parameters, 
and thus may not sometimes represent much useful 
information for classification. 
3 F in i te  M ix ture  Mode l  
We propose a method of document classification 
based on soft clustering of words. Let c l , - - . , cn  
be categories. We first conduct the soft cluster- 
ing. Specifically, we (a) define a vocabulary as a 
set W of words and define as clusters a number of 
its subsets k l , . - - ,  k,n satisfying u'~=lk j = W; (no- 
tice that ki t3 kj = 0 (i ~ j) does not necessarily 
hold here, i.e., a word can be assigned to several dif- 
ferent clusters); and (b) define for each cluster kj 
(j = 1, . . . ,  m) a distribution Q(w\[kj) over its words 
()"\]~wekj Q(w\[kj) = 1) and a distribution P(wlkj) 
satisfying: 
! Q(wlki); wek  i, P(wlkj) 0; w ? (5) 
where w denotes a random variable representing any 
word in the vocabulary. We then define for each cat- 
egory ci (i = 1, . . . ,  n) a distribution of the clusters 
P(kj Ici), and define for each category a linear com- 
bination of P(w\]kj): 
P(wlc~) = ~ P(kjlc~) x P(wlk.i) (6) 
j=l 
as the distribution over its words, which is referred 
to as afinite mixture model(e.g., (Everitt and Hand, 
1981)). 
We treat the problem of classifying a document 
as that of conducting the likelihood ratio test over 
finite mixture models. That is, we view a document 
as a sequence of words, 
d= wl ,  " " , WN (7) 
where wt(t = 1, . - . ,N )  represents a word. We 
assume that each word is independently generated 
according to an unknown probability distribution 
and determine which of the finite mixture mod- 
els P(w\[ci)(i = 1, . . . ,n)  is more likely to be the 
probability distribution by observing the sequence of 
words. Specifically, we calculate the likelihood value 
for each category with respect o the document by: 
L(d\[ci) = L(wl , . . . ,wglc i )  
= I-\[~=1 P(wt lc , )  
: n =l P(k ic,) x P(w, lk )) 
(8) 
We then classify it into the category having the 
largest likelihood value with respect o it. Hereafter, 
we will refer to this method as FMM. 
FMM includes WBM and HCM as its special 
cases. If we consider the specific case (1) in which 
a word is assigned to a single cluster and P(wlkj) is 
given by {1. 
(9) P(wlkj)= O; w~k~, 
41 
where Ikjl denotes the number of elements belonging 
to kj, then we will get the same classification result 
as in HCM. In such a case, the likelihood value for 
each category ci becomes: 
L(dlc,) = I-I;:x (P(ktlci) x P~wtlkt)) 
= 1-It=~ P(ktlci) x l-It=lP(Wtlkt), 
(lo) 
where kt is the cluster corresponding to wt. Since 
the probability P(wt\]kt) does not depend on eate- 
N gories, we can ignore the second term YIt=l P(wt Ikt) 
in hypothesis testing, and thus our method essen- 
tially becomes equivalent to HCM (c.f. Eq. (3)). 
Further, in the specific case (2) in which m = n, 
for each j, P(wlkj) has IWl parameters: P(wlkj) = 
P(wlcj), and P(kjlci ) is given by 
1; i = j, P(kjlci)= O; i# j ,  (11) 
the likelihood used in hypothesis testing becomes 
the same as that in Eq.(2), and thus our method 
becomes equivalent to WBM. 
4 Es t imat ion  and  Hypothes is  
Tes t ing  
In this section, we describe how to implement our 
method. 
Creat ing  c lusters 
There are any number of ways to create clusters on a 
given set of words. As in the case of hard clustering, 
the way that clusters are created is crucial to the 
reliability of document classification. Here we give 
one example approach to cluster creation. 
Table 6: Clusters and words 
Ik l  Iracket, stroke, shot, bal l l  
ks kick, goal, ball 
We let the number of clusters equal that of cat- 
egories (i.e., m = n) 4 and relate each cluster ki 
to one category ci (i = 1, - - . ,n) .  We then assign 
individual words to those clusters in whose related 
categories they most frequently appear. Letting 7 
(0 _< 7 < 1) be a predetermined threshold value, if 
the following inequality holds: 
f(wlci) > 7, (t2) 
f(w) 
then we assign w to ki, the cluster related to ci, 
where f(wlci) denotes the frequency of the word w 
in category ci, and f(w) denotes the total frequency 
ofw. Using the data in Tab.l,  we create two clusters: 
kt and k2, and relate them to ct and c2, respectively. 
4One can certainly assume that m > n. 
For example, when 7 = 0.4, we assign 'goal' to k2 
only, as the relative frequency of 'goal' in c~ is 0.75 
and that in cx is only 0.25. We ignore in document 
classification those words which cannot be assigned 
to any cluster using this method, because they are 
not indicative of any specific category. (For example, 
when 7 >_ 0.5 'ball' will not be assigned into any 
cluster.) This helps to make classification efficient 
and accurate. Tab. 6 shows the results of creating 
clusters. 
Es t imat ing  P(wlk j) 
We then consider the frequency of a word in a clus- 
ter. If a word is assigned only to one cluster, we view 
its total frequency as its frequency within that clus- 
ter. For example, because 'goal' is assigned only to 
ks, we use as its frequency within that cluster the to- 
tal count of its occurrence in all categories. If a word 
is assigned to several different clusters, we distribute 
its total frequency among those clusters in propor- 
tion to the frequency with which the word appears 
in each of their respective related categories. For 
example, because 'ball' is assigned to both kl and 
k2, we distribute its total frequency among the two 
clusters in proportion to the frequency with which 
'ball' appears in cl and c2, respectively. After that, 
we obtain the frequencies of words in each cluster as 
shown in Tab. 7. 
Table 7: Distributed frequencies of words 
racket stroke shot goal kick ball 
kl 4 1 2 0 0 2 
k2 0 0 0 4 2 2 
We then estimate the probabilities of words in 
each cluster, obtaining the results in Tab. 8. 5

Estimating P( kj \]ci) 
Let us next consider the estimation of P(kj\[ci). 
There are two common methods for statistical esti- 
mation, the maximum likelihood estimation method 
5We calculate the probabilities by employing the 
maximum likelihood estimator: 
/(kAc0 (13) P(kilci)- f(ci) ' 
where f(kj\]cl) is the frequency of the cluster kj in ci, 
and f(cl) is the total frequency of clusters in el.

and the Bayes estimation method. In their imple- 
mentation for estimating P(kj Ici), however, both of 
them suffer from computational intractability. The 
EM algorithm (Dempster, Laird, and Rubin, 1977) 
can be used to efficiently approximate he maximum 
likelihood estimator of P(kj \[c~). We employ here an 
extended version of the EM algorithm (Helmbold et 
al., 1995). (We have also devised, on the basis of 
the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique 
(e.g. (Tanner and Wong, 1987; Yamanishi, 1996)) 6, 
an algorithm to efficiently approximate the Bayes 
estimator of P(kj \[c~).) 
For the sake of notational simplicity, for a fixed i, 
let us write P(kjlci) as Oj and P(wlkj) as Pj(w). 
Then letting 9 = (01, ' " ,0m),  the finite mixture 
model in Eq. (6) may be written as 
rn 
P(wlO) = ~0~ x Pj(w). (14) 
j= l  
For a given training sequence wl'"WN, the maxi- 
mum likelihood estimator of 0 is defined as the value 
which maximizes the following log likelihood func- 
tion 
) L(O) = ~' log OjPj(wt) . (15) 
~- \ j= l  
The EM algorithm first arbitrarily sets the initial 
value of 0, which we denote as 0(0), and then suc- 
cessively calculates the values of 6 on the basis of its 
most recent values. Let s be a predetermined num- 
ber. At the lth iteration (l -: 1, . . - ,  s), we calculate 
= by 
0~ ' ) :  0~ '-1) (~?(VL(00-1)) j -  1)+ 1),  (16) 
where ~ > 0 (when ~ = 1, Hembold et al 's version 
simply becomes the standard EM algorithm), and 
6We have confirmed in our preliminary experiment 
that MCMC performs lightly better than EM in docu- 
ment classification, but we omit the details here due to 
space limitations. 
~TL(O) denotes 
v L(O) = ( 0L001 "'" O0,nOL ) . (17) 
After s numbers of calculations, the EM algorithm 
outputs 00) = (0~O,... ,0~ )) as an approximate of 
0. It is theoretically guaranteed that the EM al- 
gorithm converges to a local minimum of the given 
likelihood (Dempster, Laird, and Rubin, 1977). 
For the example in Tab. 1, we obtain the results 
as shown in Tab. 9. 
Test ing 
For the example in Tab. 1, we can calculate ac- 
cording to Eq. (8) the likelihood values of the two 
categories with respect o the document in Fig. 1 
(Tab. 10 shows the logarithms of the likelihood val- 
ues). We then classify the document into category 
c2, as log 2 L(d\]c2) is larger than log 2 L(dlcl). 
5 Advantages  o f  FMM 
For a probabilistic approach to document classifica- 
tion, the most important thing is to determine what 
kind of probability model (distribution) to employ 
as a representation of a category. It must (1) ap- 
propriately represent a category, as well as (2) have 
a proper preciseness in terms of number of param- 
eters. The goodness and badness of selection of a 
model directly affects classification results. 
The finite mixture model we propose is particu- 
larly well-suited to the representation f a category. 
Described in linguistic terms, a cluster corresponds 
to a topic and the words assigned to it are related 
to that topic. Though documents generally concen- 
trate on a single topic, they may sometimes refer 
for a time to others, and while a document is dis- 
cussing any one topic, it will naturally tend to use 
words strongly related to that topic. A document in 
the category of 'tennis' is more likely to discuss the 
topic of 'tennis,' i.e., to use words strongly related 
to 'tennis,' but it may sometimes briefly shift to the 
topic of 'soccer,' i.e., use words strongly related to 
'soccer.' A human can follow the sequence of words 
in such a document, associate them with related top- 
ics, and use the distributions of topics to classify the 
document. Thus the use of the finite mixture model 
can be considered as a stochastic implementation f 
this process. 
The use of FMM is also appropriate from the 
viewpoint of number of parameters. Tab. 11 shows 
the numbers of parameters in our method (FMM), 
43 
Table 11: Num. of parameters 
WBM O(n. IWl) 
HCM O(n. m) 
FMM o(Ikl+n'm) 
HCM, and WBM, where IW\] is the size of a vocab- 
ulary, Ikl is the sum of the sizes of word clusters 
m (i.e.,Ikl -- E~=I Ikil), n is the number of categories, 
and m is the number of clusters. The number of 
parameters in FMM is much smaller than that in 
WBM, which depends on IWl, a very large num- 
ber in practice (notice that Ikl is always smaller 
than IWI when we employ the clustering method 
(with 7 > 0.5) described in Section 4. As a result, 
FMM requires less data for parameter estimation 
than WBM and thus can handle the data sparseness 
problem quite well. Furthermore, it can economize 
on the space necessary for storing knowledge. On 
the other hand, the number of parameters in FMM 
is larger than that in HCM. It is able to represent the 
differences between categories more precisely than 
HCM, and thus is able to resolve the two problems, 
described in Section 2, which plague HCM. 
Another advantage of our method may be seen in 
contrast to the use of latent semantic analysis (Deer- 
wester et al, 1990) in document classification and 
document retrieval. They claim that their method 
can solve the following problems: 
synonymy problem how to group synonyms, like 
'stroke' and 'shot,' and make each relatively 
strongly indicative of a category even though 
some may individually appear in the category 
only very rarely; 
po lysemy problem how to determine that a word 
like 'ball' in a document refers to a 'tennis ball' 
and not a 'soccer ball,' so as to classify the doc- 
ument more accurately; 
dependence problem how to use de- 
pendent words, like 'kick' and 'goal,' to make 
their combined appearance in a document more 
indicative of a category. 
As seen in Tab.6, our method also helps resolve all 
of these problems. 
6 P re l iminary  Exper imenta l  Resu l t s  
In this section, we describe the results of the exper- 
iments we have conducted to compare the perfor- 
mance of our method with that of HCM and others. 
As a first data set, we used a subset of the Reuters 
newswire data prepared by Lewis, called Reuters- 
21578 Distribution 1.0. 7 We selected nine overlap- 
ping categories, i.e. in which a document may be-

long to several different categories. We adopted the 
Lewis Split in the corpus to obtain the training data 
and the test data. Tabs. 12 and 13 give the de- 
tails. We did not conduct stemming, or use stop 
words . We then applied FMM, HCM, WBM , and 
a method based on cosine-similarity, which we de- 
note as COS 9, to conduct binary classification. In 
particular, we learn the distribution for each cate- 
gory and that for its complement category from the 
training data, and then determine whether or not to 
classify into each category the documents in the test 
data. When applying FMM, we used our proposed 
method of creating clusters in Section 4 and set 7 
to be 0, 0.4, 0.5, 0.7, because these are representative 
values. For HCM, we classified words in the same 
way as in FMM and set 7 to be 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 0.95. 
(Notice that in HCM, 7 cannot be set less than 0.5.)

details. Again, we did not conduct stemming, or use 
stop words. We then applied FMM, HCM, WBM , 
and COS to conduct binary classification. When ap- 
plying FMM, we used our proposed method of creat- 
ing clusters and set 7 to be 0, 0.4, 0.5, 0.7. For HCM, 
we classified words in the same way as in FMM and 
set 7 to be 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 0.95. We have not fully com- 
pleted these experiments, however, and here we only 
8'Stop words' refers to a predetermined list of words 
containing those which are considered not useful for doc- 
ument classification, such as articles and prepositions. 
9In this method, categories and documents obe clas- 
sified are viewed as vectors of word frequencies, and the 
cosine value between the two vectors reflects similarity 
(Salton and McGill, 1983).

give the results of classifying into the ten categories 
having the greatest numbers of documents in the test 
data (see Tab. 15). 
For both data sets, we evaluated each method in 
terms of precision and recall by means of the so- 
called micro-averaging 10 
When applying WBM, HCM, and FMM, rather 
than use the standard likelihood ratio testing, we 
used the following heuristics. For simplicity, suppose 
that there are only two categories cl and c2. Letting 
? be a given number larger than or equal 0, we assign 
a new document d in the following way: 
~ (logL(dlcl) - logL(dlc2)) > e; d --* cl, (logL(dlc2) logL(dlct)) > ~; d---+ cu, 
otherwise; unclassify d, 
(is) 
where N is the size of document d. (One can easily 
extend the method to cases with a greater ~umber of 
categories.) 11 For COS, we conducted classification 
in a similar way. 
Fig s. 2 and 3 show precision-recall curves for the 
first data set and those for the second data set, re- 
spectively. In these graphs, values given after FMM 
and HCM represent 3' in our clustering method (e.g. 
FMM0.5, HCM0.5,etc). We adopted the break-even 
point as a single measure for comparison, which is 
the one at which precision equals recall; a higher 
score for the break-even point indicates better per- 
formance. Tab. 16 shows the break-even point for 
each method for the first data set and Tab. 17 shows 
that for the second data set. For the first data set, 
FMM0 attains the highest score at break-even point; 
for the second data set, FMM0.5 attains the highest. 
We considered the following questions: 
(1) The training data used in the experimen- 
tation may be considered sparse. Will a word- 
clustering-based method (FMM) outperform a word- 
based method (WBM) here? 
(2) Is it better to conduct soft clustering (FMM) 
than to do hard clustering (HCM)? 
(3) With our current method of creating clusters, 
as the threshold 7 approaches 0, FMM behaves much 
like WBM and it does not enjoy the effects of clus- 
tering at all (the number of parameters is as large 
l?In micro-averaging(Lewis and Ringuette, 1994), pre- 
cision is defined as the percentage of classified ocuments 
in all categories which are correctly classified. Recall is 
defined as the percentage of the total documents in all 
categories which are correctly classified. 
nNotice that words which are discarded in the duster- 
ing process should not to be counted in document size.

as in WBM). This is because in this case (a) a word 
will be assigned into all of the clusters, (b) the dis- 
tribution of words in each cluster will approach that 
in the corresponding category in WBM, and (c) the 
likelihood value for each category will approach that 
in WBM (recall case (2) in Section 3). Since creating 
clusters in an optimal way is difficult, when cluster- 
ing does not improve performance we can at least 
make FMM perform as well as WBM by choosing 
7 = 0. The question now is "does FMM perform 
better than WBM when 7 is 0?" 
In looking into these issues, we found the follow- 
ing: 
(1) When 3' >> 0, i.e., when we conduct clustering, 
FMM does not perform better than WBM for the 
first data set, but it performs better than WBM for 
the second data set. 
Evaluating classification results on the basis of 
each individual category, we have found that for 
three of the nine categories in the first data set,

FMM0.5 performs best, and that in two of the ten 
categories in the second data set FMM0.5 performs 
best. These results indicate that clustering some- 
times does improve classification results when we 
use our current way of creating clusters. (Fig. 4 
shows the best result for each method for the cate- 
gory 'corn' in the first data set and Fig. 5 that for 
'grain' in the second data set.) 
(2) When 3' >> 0, i.e., when we conduct clustering, 
the best of FMM almost always outperforms that of 
HCM. 
(3) When 7 = 0, FMM performs better than 
WBM for the first data set, and that it performs 
as well as WBM for the second data set. 
In summary, FMM always outperforms HCM; in 
some cases it performs better than WBM; and in 
general it performs at least as well as WBM. 
For both data sets, the best FMM results are supe- 
rior to those of COS throughout. This indicates that 
the probabilistic approach is more suitable than the 
cosine approach for document classification based on 
word distributions. 
Although we have not completed our experiments 
on the entire Reuters data set, we found that the re- 
sults with FMM on the second data set are almost as 
good as those obtained by the other approaches re- 
ported in (Lewis and Ringuette, 1994). (The results 
are not directly comparable, because (a) the results 
in (Lewis and Ringuette, 1994) were obtained from 
an older version of the Reuters data; and (b) they

7 Conc lus ions  
Let us conclude this paper with the following re- 
marks: 
1. The primary contribution of this research is 
that we have proposed the use of the finite mix- 
ture model in document classification. 
2. Experimental results indicate that our method 
of using the finite mixture model outperforms 
the method based on hard clustering of words. 
3. Experimental results also indicate that in some 
cases our method outperforms the word-based

categories, is ~va~lable at ftp://ota.ox.ac.uk

method when we use our current method of cre- 
ating clusters. 
Our future work is to include: 
1. comparing the various methods over the entire 
Reuters corpus and over other data bases, 
2. developing better ways of creating clusters. 
Our proposed method is not limited to document 
classification; it can also be applied to other natu- 
ral language processing tasks, like word sense dis- 
ambiguation, in which we can view the context sur- 
rounding a ambiguous target word as a document 
and the word-senses to be resolved as categories.
