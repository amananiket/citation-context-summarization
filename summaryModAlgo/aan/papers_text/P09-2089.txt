Abstract
For many NLP tasks, including named en-
tity tagging, semi-supervised learning has
been proposed as a reasonable alternative
to methods that require annotating large
amounts of training data. In this paper,
we address the problem of analyzing new
data given a semi-supervised NE tagger
trained on data from an earlier time pe-
riod. We will show that updating the unla-
beled data is sufficient to maintain quality
over time, and outperforms updating the
labeled data. Furthermore, we will also
show that augmenting the unlabeled data
with older data in most cases does not re-
sult in better performance than simply us-
ing a smaller amount of current unlabeled
data.
1 Introduction
Brill (2003) observed large gains in performance
for different NLP tasks solely by increasing the
size of unlabeled data, but stressed that for other
NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition
(NER), we still need to focus on developing tools
that help to increase the size of annotated data.
This problem is particularly crucial when pro-
cessing languages, such as Portuguese, for which
the labeled data is scarce. For instance, in the first
NER evaluation for Portuguese, HAREM (San-
tos and Cardoso, 2007), only two out of the nine
participants presented systems based on machine
learning, and they both argued they could have
achieved significantly better results if they had
larger training sets.
Semi-supervised methods are commonly cho-
sen as an alternative to overcome the lack of an-
notated resources, because they present a good
trade-off between amount of labeled data needed
and performance achieved. Co-training is one of
those methods, and has been extensively studied in
NLP (Nigam and Ghani, 2000; Pierce and Cardie,
2001; Ng and Cardie, 2003; Mota and Grishman,
2008). In particular, we showed that the perfor-
mance of a name tagger based on co-training de-
cays as the time gap between training data (seeds
and unlabeled data) and test data increases (Mota
and Grishman, 2008). Compared to the original
classifier of Collins and Singer (1999) that uses
seven seeds, we used substantially larger seed sets
(more than 1000), which raises the question of
which of the parameters (seeds or unlabeled data)
are causing the performance deterioration.
In the present study, we investigated two main
questions, from the point of view of a developer
who wants to analyze a new data set, given an NE
tagger trained with older data. First, we studied
whether it was better to update the seeds or the
unlabeled data; then, we analyzed whether using
a smaller amount of current unlabeled data could
be better than increasing the amount of unlabeled
data drawn from older sources. The experiments
show that using contemporary unlabeled data is
the best choice, outperforming most experiments
with larger amounts of older unlabeled data and
all experiments with contemporary seeds.
2 Contemporary labeled data in NLP
The speech community has been defending for
some time now the idea of having similar tem-
poral data for training and testing automatic
speech recognition systems for broadcast news.
Most works focus on improving out-of-vocabulary
(OOV) rates, to which new names contribute
significantly. For instance, Palmer and Osten-
dorf (2005) aiming at reducing the error rate due
to OOV names propose to generate offline name
lists from diverse sources, including temporally
relevant news texts; Federico and Bertoldi (2004),
and Martins et al (2006) propose to daily adapt
the statistical language model of a broadcast
353
news transcription system, exploiting contempo-
rary newswire texts available on the web; Auzanne
et al (2000) proposed a time-adaptive language
model, studying its impact over a period of five
months on the reduction of OOV rate, word error
rate and retrieval accuracy on a spoken document
retrieval system.
Concerning variations over longer periods of
time, we observed that the performance of a semi-
supervised name tagger decays over a period of
eight years, which seems to be directly related
with the fact that the texts used to train and test the
tagger also show a tendency to become less simi-
lar over time (Mota and Grishman, 2008); Batista
et al (2008) also observed a decaying tendency in
the performance of a system for recovering capi-
talization over a period of six years, proposing to
retrain a MaxEnt model using additional contem-
porary written texts.
3 Name tagger overview
We assessed the name tagger described in Mota
and Grishman (2008) to recognize names of peo-
ple, organizations and locations. The tagger is
based on the co-training NE classifier proposed
by Collins and Singer (1999), and is comprised
of several components organized sequentially (cf.
Figure 1).

4 Data sets
CETEMPu?blico (Rocha and Santos, 2000) is a
Portuguese journalistic corpus with 180 million
words that spans eight years of news, from 1991
to 1998. The minimum size of epoch (time span
of data set) available for analysis is a six-month
period, corresponding either to the first half of the
year or the second.
The data sets were created using the first 8256
extracts1 within each six-month period of the pol-
itics section of the corpus: the first 192 are used to
collect seeds, the next 208 extracts are used as test
sets and the remaining 7856 are used to collect the
unlabeled examples. The seeds correspond to the
first 1150 names occurring in those extracts. From
the list of unlabeled examples obtained after the
NE identification stage, only the first 41226 exam-
ples of each epoch were used to bootstrap in the
classification stage.
5 Experiments
We denote by S, U and T , respectively, the seed,
unlabeled and test texts, and by (S
i
, U
j
, T
k
) a
training-test configuration, where 91a ? i, j, k ?
98b, i.e., epochs i, j and k vary between the first
half of 1991 (91a) and the second half of 1998
(98b). For instance, the training-test configuration
(S
i=91a...98b
, U
i=91a...98b
, T
j=98b
) represents the
training-test configuration where the test set was
drawn from epoch 98b, and the tagger was trained
in turn with seeds and unlabeled data drawn from
the same epoch i that varied from 91a to 98b.
5.1 Do we need contemporary labeled data?
In order to understand whether it is better to label
examples falling within the epoch of the test set
or to keep using old labeled data while bootstrap-
ping with contemporary unlabeled data, we fixed
the test set to be within the last epoch of the inter-
val (98b), and performed backward experiments,
i.e., we varied the epoch of either the seeds or the
unlabeled data backwards. The choice of fixing
the test within the last epoch of the interval is the
one that most approximates a real situation where
one has a tagger trained with old data and wants to
process a more recent text.
Figure 2 shows the results for both experiments,
where (S
j=98b
, U
i=91a...98b
, T
j=98b
) represents the
experiment where the test was within the same
epoch as the seeds and the unlabeled data were
drawn from a single, variable, epoch in turn, and
(S
i=91a...98b
, U
j=98b
, T
j=98b
) represents the exper-
iment where the test was within the epoch of the

unlabeled data and the seeds were drawn in turn
from each of the epochs; the graphic also shows

As can be seen, there is a small gain in perfor-
mance by using seeds within the epoch of the test
set, but the decay is still observable as we increase
the time gap between the unlabeled data and the
test set. On the contrary, if we use unlabeled data
within the epoch of the test set, we hardly see
a degradation trend as the time gap between the
epochs of seeds and test set is increased.
An examination of the results shows that, for
instance, Sendero Luminoso received the correct
classification of organization when the tagger is
trained with unlabeled data drawn from the same
epoch, but is incorretly classified as person when
trained with data that is not contemporary with the
test set. Even though that name is not a seed in any
of the cases, it occurs twice in good contexts for
organization in unlabeled data contemporary with
the test set (l??der do Sendero Luminoso/leader of
the Shining Path and acc?o?es do Sendero Lumi-
noso/actions of the Shining Path), while it does
not occur in the unlabeled data that is not contem-
porary. Given that both the name spelling and the
context in the test set, o messianismo do peruano
Sendero Luminoso/the messianism of the Peruvian
Shining Path, are insufficient to assign a correct la-
bel, the occurrence of the name in the contempo-
rary unlabeled data contributes to its correct clas-
sification in the test set.
5.2 Is more older unlabeled data better?
The second question we addressed was whether
having more older unlabeled data could result in
better performance than less data but within the
epoch of the test set. In this case, we conducted
two backward experiments, augmenting the un-
labeled data backwards with older data than the
test set (98b), starting in the previous epoch (98a):
in the first experiment, the seeds were within the
same epoch as the test set, and in the second ex-
periment the seeds were within the same epoch as
the unlabeled set being added. This corresponds to
configurations (S
j=98b
, U ?
i=91a...98a
, T
j=98b
) and
(S
i=91a...98a
, U ?
i=91a...98a
, T
j=98b
), respectively,
where U ?

In Figure 3, we show the result of these con-
figurations together with the result of the back-
ward experiment corresponding to configuration
(S

, U
j=98b
, T
j=98b
), also represented in
Figure 2. We note that, in the case of the former
experiments, the size of the unlabeled examples is
increasing in the direction 98a to 91a.

As can be observed, increasing the size of the
unlabeled data does not necessarily result in bet-
ter performance: for both choices of seeds, perfor-
mance sometimes improves, sometimes worsens,
as the unlabeled data grows (following the curves
355
from right to left).
Furthermore, the tagger trained with more unla-
beled data in most cases did not outperform the
tagger trained with less unlabeled data selected
from the epoch of the test set.
6 Discussion and future directions
We conducted experiments varying the epoch of
seeds and unlabeled data of a named entity tagger
based on co-training. We observed that the per-
formance decay resulting from increasing the time
gap between training data (seeds and unlabeled ex-
amples) and the test set can be slightly attenuated
by using the seeds contemporary with the test set.
The gain is larger if one uses older seeds and con-
temporary unlabeled data, a strategy that, in most
of the experiments, results in better performance
than using increasing sizes of older unlabeled data.
These results suggest that we may not need to
label new data nor train our tagger with increasing
sizes of data, as long as we are able to train it with
unlabeled data time compatible with the test set.
In the future, one issue that needs clarification is
why bootstraping from contemporary labeled data
had so little influence on the performance of co-
training, and if other semi-supervised approches
are also sensitive to this question.
