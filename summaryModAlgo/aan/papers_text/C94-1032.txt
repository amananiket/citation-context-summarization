Abstract  
We present a novel method for segmenting the input 
sentence into words and assigning parts of speech to 
the words. It consists of a statistical language model 
and an efficient wo-pa~qs N-best search algorithm. The 
algorithm does not require delimiters between words. 
Thus it is suitable for written Japanese. q'he proposed 
Japanese morphological nalyzer achieved 95. l% recall 
and 94.6% precision for open text when it was trained 
and tested on the ATI'? Corpus. 
1 Introduct ion 
In recent years, we have seen a fair number of l)al)ers re- 
porting accuracies ofmore than 95% for English part of 
speech tagging with statistical language modeling tech- 
niques \[2-4, 10, 11\]. On the other hand, there are few 
works on stochastic Japanese morphological nalysis 
\[9, 12, 14\], and they don't seem to have convinced the 
Japanese NLP community that the statistically-based 
teclmiques are superior to conventional rule-based tech- 
niques uch as \[16, 17\]. 
We show in this paper that we can buihl a stochastic 
Japanese morphological nalyzer that offers approxi- 
mately 95% accuracy on a statistical language model- 
ing technique and an efficient two-pass N-best search 
strategy. 
We used tile simple tri-POS model as the tagging 
model for Japanese. Probability estimates were ob- 
tained after training on the ATI{ l)ialogue Database 
\[5\], whose word segmentation a d part of speech tag 
assignment were laboriously performed by hand. 
We propose a novel search strategy for getting the 
N best morphological nalysis hypotheses for the in- 
put sentence. It consists of the forward dynamic pro- 
gramming search and the backward A* search. The 
proposed algorithm amalgamates and extends three 
well-known algorithms in different fields: the Minimum 
Connective-Cost Method \[7\] for Japanese morphologi- 
cal analysis, Extended Viterbi Algorithm for charac- 
ter recognition \[6\], and "l~'ee-Trellis N-Best Search for 
speech recognition \[15\]. 
We also propose a novel method for handling un- 
known words uniformly within the statistical pproach. 
Using character trigrams ms tim word model, it gener- 
ates the N-best word hypotheses that match the left- 
most substrings starting at a given position in the input 
senten  ce. 
Moreover, we propose a novel method for evaluat- 
ing the performance of morphological analyzers. Un- 
like English, Japanese does not place spaces between 
words. It is difficult, even for native Japanese, to place 
word boundaries consistently because of the aggluti- 
native nature of the language. Thus, there were no 
standard performance metrics. We applied bracketing 
accuracy measures \[1\], which is originally used for En- 
glish parsers, to Japanese morphological nalyzers. We 
also slightly extended the original definition to describe 
the accuracy of tile N-best candidates. 
In the following sections, we first describe the tech- 
niques used in the proposed morphological nalyzer, 
we then explain the cwduation metrics and show the 
system's performance by experimental results. 
2 Tagging Model  
2.1 Tr i -POS Mode l  and  Re la t ive  F re -  
quency  Tra in ing  
We used the tri-POS (or triclass, tri-tag, tri-Ggram 
etc.) model ~Ls tile tagging model for Japanese. Con- 
sider a word segmentation f the input sentence W = 
wl w2. . .  w,~ and a sequence of tags T = t i ts . . ,  t,, of 
the same length. The morphological analysis tmsk cau 
I)e formally defined ,~ finding a set of word segmen- 
tat.ion and parts of speech ~ssignment that maximize 
the joint probability of word sequence arm tag sequence 
P(W, 7'). In the tri-POS model, the joint probability is
approximated bythe product of parts of speech trigram 
probabilities P(t i l t i_2,t i_ l )  and word output probabil- 
ities for given part of speech P(wl\]ll): 
r(w,:r) = \]~ r(tdt,_o.,t,_x)r'(w, lt4 (1) 
i=1 
201 
In practice, we consider sentence boundaries ~s special 
symbols as follows. 
P(W,T) = P(ql#)P(wtltt)P(t,. l#, tl)P(w21t~) 
~I P(tilti_2,ti_l)P(willi)P(#\[t,,_l,?,,) (2) 
i=3 
where "#" indicates the sentence boundary marker. If 
we have some tagged text available, we can estimate the 
probabilities P(tdti_2,ti_l ) and P(wiltl) by comput- 
ing the relative frequencies of the corresponding events 
on this data:. 
N(ti_2, ti-1, tl) 
P(tifti-2'ti-t) = f(qltl-2'ti-x) - iV ( t i _ . . , , t i _ , )  
(3) 
P(wilti) = f(wilt,) -- N(w,t) ('1) 
N(t) 
where f indicates the relative frequency, N(w, t) is t!,e 
number of times a given word w appears with tag l, aid 
N(li_2,ti-l,tl) is the number of times that sequer~ce 
l~ i _2t i _ l l  i appears in the text. It is inevitable to s~ irer 
from sparse-data problem in the part of speech tag tri- 
gram probability I . To handle open text, trigram Frol:- 
ability is smoothed by interpolated estimation, wi~ich 
simply interpolates trlgram, bigram, unigram, and ze- 
rogram relative frequencies\[8\], 
P ( t i lq_ , ,q_ l  ) = qaf(tilt,_2,q_, ) 
A-q2f(tdti_l) + qtf(ti) + qoV (5) 
where f indicates the relative.frequency and V is a 
uniform probability that each tag will occur. The non- 
negative weights qi satisfy q3 + q~ + q1 + q0 = 1, and 
they are adjusted so as to make the observed ata most 
probable after the adjustment by using EM algorithm ~-. 
2.2 Order Reduct ion  and Recursive 
Tracing 
In order to understand the search algorithm described 
in the next section, we will introduce the second order 
HMM and extended Viterbi algorithm \[6\]. Considering 
the combined state sequence U = ltl'tt2.., ttn, where 
ul = tl and ui = ti-tli, we have 
P(uilui_l) = P(tilti_=,ti_l) (6) 
Substituting Equation (6) into Equation (l), we have 
lWe used 120 part of speedl tags. In the ATR Corpus, 26 
parts of speech, 13 conjugation types, and 7 conjugation forms 
are defined. Out of 26, 5 parts of speech ave conjugation. Since 
we used a list of part of speech, conjugation type, and conjuga- 
tion form as a tag, there are 119 tags in the A'IT? Corpus. We 
added the sentence boundary marker to them. 
aTo handle open text, word output probahility P( lo i l t i )  must 
also be smoothed. Tiffs problem is discussed in a later section *Ls 
the unknown word problem.

Equation (8) suggests that, to find the maxlmmn 
P(I,Vi,7\]) for each ul, we need only to: remember the 
maximum P(W?_I, 7\]_1), extend each of these prob- 
abilities to every ul by computing Eqnation (8), and 
select the m;uxinmm P(~/Vi,Ti) for each ui. 'thus, by 
increasing i by 1 to n, selecting the u.  ttlat maximize 
P(W.,7\]~), and backtracing the sequence leading to 
the nmxinmm probability, we can get the optimal tag 
seqnence.  
3 Search  S t ra tegy  
The search algorithm consists of a forward dynamic 
programming search and a backward A* search. First, 
a linear time dynamic programming is used for record- 
ing the scores of all partial paths in a table 3. A back- 
ward A* algorithm based tree search is then used to 
extend the partial paths. Partial paths extended in the 
backward tree search are ranked by their correspond- 
ing fill path scores, which are cmnputed by adding 
the scores of backward partial path scores to the cot  
responding best possihle scores of the remaining paths 
which are prerecorded in the forward search. Since the 
score of the incomplete portion of a path is exactly 
known, the backward search is admissible. That is, the 
top-N candidates are exact. 
3.1 The Forward DP Search 
Table 1 shows the two data structures used in our al- 
gorithm. The st,'t, cture parse stores tile information 
of a word and the best partial path up to the word. 
Parse .s ta r t  and parse.end are the indices of tile 
start and end positions of the word in the sentence. 
Parse.pos is tile part of speech tag, which is a list of 
part of speech, conjugation type, and conjugation form 
in our system for Japanese. Parse .n th -order -~tate  
is a list of the last two parts of speech tags includ- 
ing that of the current word. This slot corresponds 
to the combined state in the second order IIMM. 
Parse .prob-so - fa r  is the score of the best partial 
path from the beginning of the sentence to the word. 
Parse.prev?ous i  the pointer to the (best) previous 
parse structure as in conventional Viterbi decoding, 
which is not necessary if we use the backward N best 
search.  
~ln fact, we use two tables, pa~se-\]. ist and path-~ap. The 
reason is described later. 
202 
The structure word represents the word information 
in the dictionary including its lexical form, part of 
speech tag, and word output probability given tt,e part 
of speech.

Before explaining tim forward search, we will de-

rithm. In the forward search, we use a table called 
parse-list, whose key is the end position of the 
parse  structure, and wlm,se value is a list of parse 
structures that have the best partial path scores for 
each combined state at the end position. Function 
reg is ter - to -parse - l i s t  registers a parse  structure 
against the parse-list and maintains the best par- 
tim parses. Function get -parse - l i s t  returns a list 
of parse  structnres at the specified position. We also 
use the fimetion l e l tmost -subst r ings  which returns 
a list of word  structures in the dictionary whose lexical 
form matches the substrings tarting at the. specified 
position in the input sentence.

Figure h The forward DP search algorithm 
Figure 1 shows the central part of the forward dy- 
namic programming search algorithm. It starts from 
the beg,string of tim inlmt sentence, and proceeds char- 
attar by character. At each point in tim sentence, it 
looks up the combination of the best partial parses 
ending at the point and word hypotheses tarting at 
that point. If tim connection of a partial parse and 
a word llypothesis is allowed by the tagging model, a 
new continuation parse is made and registered in the 
parse - l i s t .  The partial path score for the new con- 
titular,on parse is the product of the best partial path 
score up to the poi,g, the trigram probability of the 
last three parts of speech tags and the word output 
probability for LIfe part of speech 4. 
3 .2  The  Backward  A* Search  
The backward search uses a table called path-map, 
whose key is the end position of tile parse  structure, 
and whose value is a list of parse  structures that have 
the best partial path scores for each distinct combin~ 
ties of the start position and the combined state. The 
dilference 1)etween parse - l i s t  and path-map is that 
path-map is classi/ied by tim start position of the last 
word in addition to tim combined state. 
This distinction is crucial for the proposed N best 
algorithm, l"or tim tbrward search to tind a parse that 
maximizes Equation (1), it is the parts of speech se- 
quence that matters. For the backward N-best search, 
how(wet, we want N most likely word segmentation and 
part of speech sequence. Parse-list may shadow less 
probable candidates that have the same part of speech 
sc:qnence for the best scoring candidate, but differ in 
tim segmentaL,on of the last word. As shown in Figure 
1, path-map is made during the forward search by the 
function reg is ter -parse - to -path -map,  which regis- 
ters a parse  structure to path-map and maintains the 
best partial parses in the table's criteria. 
Now we describe the central part of tim backward 
A* search algorithm. But we assume that the readers 
know the A* algorithm, and exphtin only the way we 
applied the algorithm to the problem. 
We consider a parse structure ,~q a state in A* 
search. Two slates are e(plat if their parse  structures 
have the same start position, end position, and com- 
bined state. The backward search starts at the end of 
the input, sentence, and backtracks to the beginning of 
the sentence using tim path-map. 
Initial states are obtained by looking up the entries 
of tim sentence nd position of the path-map. The suc- 
cessor states are obtained by first, looking u 1) tim en- 
tries of the path-map at the start position of the cur- 
rent parse,  then cbecldng whether they satisfy the con- 
straint of the combined state transition in the second 
order IIMM, aim whether the transition is allowed by 
the tagging model. The combined state transition con- 
straint means that tim part of speech sequence in the 
parse .n th -order -s ta te  of the current parse,  ignor- 
4 In Figure 1, function transprob returns the probability of 
given trlgraln. Functions i n i t ia l - s tep  and f ina l - s tep  treat

ing the last element, equals that of tile previous parse, 
ignoring the first element. 
The state transition cost of the backward search is 
the product of the part of speech trigram probability 
and the word output probability. Tile score estimate 
of the remaining portion of a path is obtained from the 
parse .prob-so -~ar  slot in the parse structure. 
The backward search generates the N best hypothe- 
ses sequentially and there is no need to preset N. The 
complexity of the backward search is significantly less 
than that of the forward search. 
4 Word  Mode l  
To handle open text, we have to cope with unknown 
words. Since Japanese do not put spaces between 
words, we have to identify unknown words at first. To 
do this, we can look at the spelling (character sequence) 
that may constitute a word, or look at the context o 
identify words that are acceptable in this context. 
Once word hypotheses for unknown words are gener- 
ated, the proposed N-best algorithm will find tile most 
likely word segmentation a d part of speech assignment 
taking into account he entire sentence. Therefore, we 
can formalize the unknown word problem as (letermin- 
ing the span of an unknown word, assigning its part of 
speech, and estimating its probability given its part of 
speech. 
Let us call a computational model that determines 
the probability of any word hypothesis given its lexi- 
cal form and its part of speech the "word model". The 
word model must account for morphology and word for- 
marion to estimate the part of speech and tile probabil- 
ity of a word hypothesis. For tile first approxinmtion, 
we used the character trigram of each part of sl)eech as 
the word model. 
Let C = cic~.., c,~ denote the sequence of n charac- 
ters that constitute word zv whose part of speech is t. 
We approximate the probability of the word given part 
of speech P(wlt ) by tile trigram probabilities, 
p(,,,Iz) = P,(C) - -  f',(~,l#, #)~',(~1#, <) 
u 
IX P,(~,lc+-=, ~ -~)r,(#1c.._l, ..,) 
i=3 
(9) 
where special symbol "#" indicates ttle word boundary 
marker. Character trigram probabilities are estimated 
from the training corpus by computing relative fre- 
quency of character bigram and trigram that appeared 
in words tagged as t. 
Pt(cilci-2, q - i )  = f,(c~l~-=, ?,-~) = Nt(ci_2, Ci_l, ci) 
N,(c~_.~, i) 
(lO) 
where Nt(ci_2,ci_~,ci) is tile total number of times 
character trigram ci_2ci_~el appears in words tagged 
as t in the training corpus. Note that the character 
trigram probabilities reflect the frequency of word to- 
kens in tile training corpus. Since there are more than 
3,000 characters in Japanese, trigram probabilities are 
smoothed by interpolated estimation to cope with the 
sparse-data problem. 
It is ideal to make this character trigram model for 
all open clmss categories, llowever, the amount of train- 
ing data is too small for low frequency categories if we 
divide it by part of speech tags. Therefore, we made 
trigram models only for tile 4 most frequent parts of 
speech that are open categories and have no conju~ 
gation. They are common noun, proper noun, sahen 
no/ln5~ and nun lera l .

most substrings starting at a given position in tile input 
sentence. In the forward search, to handle unknown 
words, word hypotheses are generated at every posi- 
tion in addition to the ones generated by the function

5 Eva luat ion  Measures  
We applied the performance measures for English 
parsers \[1\] to Japanese morphological analyzers. The 
basic idea is that morphological nalysis for a sentence 
can be thought of as a set of labeled brackets, where a 
bracket corresponds to word segmentation and its la-. 
bel corresponds to part of speech. We then compare 
the brackets contained in the system's output to the 
brackets contained in the standard analysis. For the 
N-best candidate, we will make the union of t\],e brack- 
ets contained in each candidate, and compare thenr to 
the brackets in the standard. 
For comparison, we court{, the number of I)rackcts 
in the standard data (Std), the number of brackets in 
the system output (Sys), and the nunlber of match- 
ing brackets (M). We then calculate the nleasurcs of 
recall (= M/Std) and precision (= M/Sys). We also 
connt the number of crossings, which is tile mmtber of 
c,'mes where a bracketed sequence from the standard 
data overlaps a bracketed sequence from tile system 
output, but neither sequence is completely coutained 
in the other. 
We defined two equaiity criteria of brackets for 
counting tim number of matching brackets. Two brack- 
ets are unlabeled-bracket-equal if the boundaries of the 
two brackets are tile same. Two brackets are labeled- 
bracket.equal if the labels of the brackets ark the same 
in addition to unlabeled-I)racket-equal. In comparing 
the consistency of the word segmentations of two brack- 
clings, wllich we call structure-consistency, we count 
the measures (recall, precision, crossings) by unlabeled- 
bracket-equal. In comparing the consistency of part 
of speech assignment in addition to word segmenta- 
tion, which we call label-consistency, we couut them by 
labeled-bracket-equal.

a corpus of approxiumtely 800,000 words whose word 
segmentatio,l and part of speech tag assigmnent were 
laboriously performed by hand. In tiffs experilneut, we 
only used one fourth of the A'Ft~. Corl)us , a portion of 
the keyl)oard dialogues in the conference registration 
domain. First, we selected 1,000 test sentences for all 
open test, arid used I.he others for training. Tile corpus 
was divided into 90% R)r training and 10% for test- 
ing. We then selected 1,000 sentences from tile traiu- 
ing set and used them for a closed test. The number of 
sentences, words, and characters for each test set and 
training texts are shown iu 'Pable 2. 
The training texts contained 6580 word types and 
6945 tag trigram types. There were 247 unknown 
word types and 213 unknown tag trigram types in tim 
open test senteuces. Thus, both part of speech tri-

be snioothed to handle open texts.

First, as a I)reliminary experiment, we compared tile 
perforn)ances of part of speech bigram and trigram. 
Table 3 shows the percentages of words correctly seg- 
mented and tagged, tested on the closed test sentences. 
The trigram model achiew;d 97.5% recall and 97.8% 
precision flu" the top candidate, while tile bigram model 
achiew.'d 96.2% recall and 96.6% precision. Although 
both tagging models sllow very high l)erformanee, tile 
20,5 
trigram model outperformed tile bigram model in every 
metric. 
We then tested the proposed system, which uses 
smoothed part of speech trigram with word model, on 
the open test sentences. Table 4 shows tile percentages 
of words correctly segmented and tagged. In Table 4, 
label consistency 2 represents the accuracy of segmen- 
tation and tagging ignoring the difference in conjuga- 
tion form. 
For open texts, tile morphological nalyzer achieved 
95.1% recall and 94.6% precision for the top candidate, 
and 97.8% recall and 73.2% precision for the 5 best 
candidates. This performance is very encouraging, and 
is comparable to the state-of-the-art stochastic tagger 
for English \[2-4, 10, 11\]. 
Since the segmentation accuracy of the proposed sys- 
tem is relatively high (97.7% recall and 97.2% precision 
for the top candidate) compared to the morphologi- 
cal analysis accuracy, it is likely that we can improve 
the part of speech assignment accuracy by refining the 
statistically-based tagging model. We find a fair num- 
ber of tagging errors happened in conjugation forms. 
We assume that this is caused by the fact that the 
Japanese tag set used in tile ATR. Corpus is not de- 
tailed enough to capture the complicated Japanese verb 
morphology.

Figure 5: Tile percentage of sentences correctly seg- 
mented and tagged. 
Figure 5 shows tile percentage of sentences (not 
words) correctly segmented and tagged. For open texts, 
the sentence accuracy of the raw part of speech trigram 
without word model is 62.7% for the top candidate and 
70.4% for the top-5, while that of smoothed trigram 
with word model is 66.9% for the top and 80.3% for the 
top-5. We can see that, by smoothing tile part ofsllecch 
trigram and by adding word model to handle unknown 
words, the accuracy and robustness of the morpholog- 
ical analyzer is significantly improved. Ilowever, tile 
sentence accuracy for closed texts is still significantly 
better that that for ol)en texts. It is clear that more 
research as to be done on the smoothing problem. 
7 Discuss ion 
Morphological analysis is an important practical prob- 
lem with potential apl)lication in many areas including 
kana-to-kanji conversion 7, speech recognition, charac- 
ter recognition, speech synthesis, text revision support, 
information retrieval, and machine translation. 
Most conventional Japanese morphological nalyzers 
use rule-based heuristic searches. They usually use a 
connectivity rnatrix (part-of-sl)eech-pair grammar) ,as 
the language model. To rank the morphological nal- 
ysis hypotheses, they usually use heuristics uch as 
Longest Match Method or Least Bunsetsu's Number 
Method \[16\]. 
There are some statistically-based approaches to 
Japanese morphological nalysis. The tagging models 
previously used are either part of speech I)igram \[9, 14\] 
or Character-based IIMM \[12\]. 
Both hem'istic-based and statistically-based ap- 
proaches use t.he Minimum Connective-Cost Method 
\[7\], which is a linear time dynamic programming algo- 
rithm that finds the morphological hypothesis that has 
tile minimal connective cost (i.e. bigram-ba~sed cost) 
as derived by certain criteria. 
q'o handle unknown words, most Japanese morpho- 
logical analyzers u,~e character type heuristics \[17\], 
which is "a string of the same character type is likely to 
constitute a word". There is one stochastic approach 
that uses bigram of word formation unit \[13\]. tlowever, 
it does not learn probabilities from training texts, but 
learns them fi'om machine readable dictionaries, and 
the model is not incorporated in working morphologi- 
cal analyzers, as fitr as the author knows. 
The unique features of the proposed Japanese mor- 
phological analyzer is that it can find tile exact N most 
likely hyl)otheses using part of speech trigram, and it 
can handle unlmown words using character trigram. 
The algoril.hm can naturally be extended to handle any 
higher order Markov models. Moreover, it can nat- 
nrally be extended to handle lattice-style input that 
is often used as t.he output of speech recognition and 
character ecognition systems, by extending the func- 
tion ( le f tmost -subat r inga)  so as to return a list of 
words in the dictionary that matches the substrings in 
tile input lattice stm'ting at the specified p(xqition. 
For future wot'k, we have to study the most effective 
way of generating word hypotheses that can handh. ? un: 
known words. Currently, we are limiting the number of 
word hypotheses to reduce ambiguity at tile cost of ac- 
curacy. We have also to study tile word model for open 
categories thai, have conjugation, because the training

data gets too small to make trigrams if we divide it by 
tags. We will probably have to tie some parameters to 
solve the insufficient data problem. 
Moreover, we have to study the method to adapt he 
system to a new domain. To develop an m~supervised 
learning method, like the forward-backward algorithm 
for IIMM, is an urgent goal, since we can't always ex- 
pect the availability of manually segmented and tagged 
data. We can think of an EM algorithm by replacing 
maximization with summation in the extended Viterbi 
algorithm, but we don't know how to handle unknown 
words in this algorithm. 
8 Conc lus ion  
We have developed a stochastic Japanese morphologi- 
cal analyzer. It uses a statistical tagging model and an 
efficient two-pass earch algorithm to llnd the N best 
morphological nalysis hypotheses for the input sen- 
tence. Its word segmentation a d tagging accuracy is 
approxlmatcly 95%, which is comparable to the star.e- 
of-the-art stochastic tagger for English.
