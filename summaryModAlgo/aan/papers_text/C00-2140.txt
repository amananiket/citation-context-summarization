Abstract 
In this paper, we present a summa.rization system 
for spontaneous dialogues which consists of a novel 
multi-stage architectm'e. It is specifically aimed at 
addressing issues related to tlle nature of the l;exts 
being spoken vs. written and being diMogical vs. 
monologica.l. The system is embedded in a. graph- 
ical user interface ~md was developed and tested on 
transcripts of recorded telephone conversations in 
English and Spanish (CAI,LHOMI,;). 
1 Introduct ion 
Summa.rization of written docmnents has recently 
O' been a. focus for much research in NI,t ~ ( ~.o., (Mani 
and 1Vlasq~ury , 1997; AAAI, 1998; Mani el. al., 1998; 
ACL, 2000), to nanle some of tile Inajol: events in 
this field ill the past few years). Ilowever, very lit- 
tle a.ttention has been given so far to the summa- 
riza.tion of spol, r('~n language, even less of conversa- 
lions vs. monologic'al texts. We believe tha.t sum- 
mariza.tion of speech will bccoJne increasingly more 
important, a.s the ~ml(mnt of online audio daLa. grows 
and demand for r~tl)id browsing, skimming, a.nd a.e- 
cess of speech data increases. Another application 
which particulm:ly pertains to our interest in spo-- 
ken dialogue summarization would be the generation 
of meeting minutes for archival purposes a.nd/or to 
update l)a.rticil)a.nts .joining a.t la.ter stages on qm' 
progress of the conversa.tion so far. 
Sunmmrization of dialogues within l imilcd do- 
mains ha.s been attempted within the context of 
the VERBMOBII, pl:ojcct ("protocol generation", 
(Alexandersson and Poller, 1998)) or by SRI's MIMI 
summarizer (Kameyama et ~d., 1996). l{ecent work 
on spoken language summarization i unrestricted 
domains has focused ahnost exclusively on Broad- 
cast News, mostly due to the spoken hmguage track 
of recent TREC evaluations (Oarofolo et al, 1997; 
Garotblo et al, 1999). (Waibel et a.1., 1(.)98) describe 
a Meeting Browser where summaries earl be gener- 
ated using technology established for written texts. 
(Va.lenza. el. M., 1999) go one step further and incof  
pora.te knowledge from the speech recognizer (con- 
fidence scores) into their summarization system, as 
well. 
We a.rgue that the nature of spoken dialogues, to- 
gether with their textual representations a speech 
recognizer hypotheses, requires a. set of specific al> 
proa.ches to make summarization feasible for this 
text genre. 
As a demonstrable proof of concept, we present 
the multi-stage a.rchitecture of the summa.rization 
system I)IASUMM which can flexibly deal with spo- 
ken di,dogues in English and Spa.nish, without any 
restrictions of domahl. Since it cannot rely on a.ny 
domain specific knowledge base, it uses shallow sta- 
tisticaJ approaches and presents (possibly modified) 
ca:lracts from the original text. as summa.ry. 
We. present results of several evaluations of our 
system using human transcripts of spontaneous tele- 
phone conversations in English and Spanish from the 
(~,AI,LIIOME corl)/ls ((LI)C), 1996), in particular the 
accura.cy of the topic segmentation and in\[brmat.ion 
condensing components (sections (5 and 7). Also, Ibr 
I.he purpose of a global evaluation, a user study was 
l~ei:%i:med which a.ddresscd in\[or\]nation access t.inJe 
a.nd a.ccura.ey of retaine.d information eompa.ring dif- 
ferent versions of summaries (section 10). 
This paper is organized as follows: In the next sec- 
tion, we provide, a.n ow;rview a.bout t}ie in,till issues

I;hc "~l)l)roaches we, are taking in our system. We 
then present he system a.rchitecture (section 3), fol- 
lowed by a. detailed description of the readier building 
blocks (sections <1 to 8). After a. brief elmra.cteriza- 
tion of the (2 UI (section 9) we describe a user study 
for global system evaluation in section 10. We con- 
clude the pa.per with a smmnary and a brief outlook 
in section 11. 
2 Issues and Approaches: Overview 
In this section, we give a,n overview about the main 
issues that a.ny sunmmrizat;ion system for spoken di- 
a.logues has to address mid indica.te the approach we 
are taking for each of these in I)IASUMM. 
In a generM sense, when dealing with written 
texts, usually there is plenty of information avail- 
able which can be used lbr the purpose of summa- 
968 
rization, such as capitalization, i)un(-tuation ~narks, 
t,itles, passage head(rs, i)aragral)h boundaries, or 
other ,nark-ul)S. (hfforl.mud.ely, however, ,,onc (.)f 
this holds for :q)ccch data whh:h arrives as a stream 
of word l,ok('w; from ;I recognizer, (:ut iuto "utt(.q'-

2.1. Lack of  clause. 1)Oulldaries 
One of the mosl. serious issues is the lack el senten(:e 
or clause boundaries in spoken dialogues whi(:h ix

cause a. r(;du(:tion in coh(,,ren(:c and r<~dability of 
the outlmt. 
We address this issue I)y linking adjac(;nt tm'ns 
of th(; smue sl)eaker together if the silence between 
them ix less than a given col,sl.\[/llt (se(;tioll d). 
2.2 Distr i lml ;c .d int ' (n 'mat io l l  
Siuce we have multi-pari,y conversations as o\])l)oscd 
to Inonologi('al texts, sonmtimcs the cru(:ial in\['or- 
matiou is found in a question-auswer-l)air , i.e., it 
involv('s more than oue Sl)eaker; extracting ouly the 
question or only the auswer wo,ld be meaningless 
in ma.ny cases. We found that on average about 
10% el' the speaker turns belong to such question- 
answer l)airs in five examined English (~AIA,IIOME 
dialogues. Often, either the question or the answer 
ix very shoI:t and does not contain any words with 
high relevan(:c. In order not to "lose" these short 
tutus at a later stage, when only the n~ost, relevant 
turns are extracted, we link them to the matching 
question/answer ahead of/. ime, using two different 
methods to detect questions aud their answers (sec- 
tion 4). 
2.3 D is t luent  speech 
Speech disfluencies in spontaneous convers,ttions - -  
such as fillers, repetitions, repairs, or unfinished 
clauses -- can make transcril)ts (and summary  ex- 
tracts) quite ha.rd to read and also introduce all tin- 
wanted bias to relevance computat ions (e.g., word 
repetitions would cause a higher word count tbr the 
repeated content words; words in untinished clauses 
would be included in the word count.) 
'l'o alleviate this problem, we employ a clean-up 
tilter pipeline, which eliminates liller words and ,:el)- 
el.it.ions, and segments the tm'ns into short clauses 
(sectiou 5). \Ve also remove incomplete clauses, typ- 
ically sentem:c-iuitial repairs, at this stage of our 
'.syst?lu. This "clea.niug-up" serves two main pur- 
1)oscs: (i) it. im:rea~cs tim readabilit3~ (for the fiually 
(;xtracl.cd segments); and (ii)it. ~nakcs the text more 
tractable by subsequent modules. 
The following exalnl)le com\])arcs a turn before and 
after t.he clean-up component:  
before: I MEAN WE LOSE WE LOSE I CAN'T I 
CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT SO 
after: we lose / i can't do anything 
about it 
2.4 Lack of tel)i(" l)oundaries

(.lilt'erent opics within a 10-mimd;e segment of a di-- 
ah)gue, i.e., the. topic changes about every 1 2 min- 
utes in these conversations. To facilitate browsing 
and smHtlmrization, we thus have to discover topi- 
(:ally coherent, segl,lents automatical ly.  This is done 
using a TextTi l ing approach, adapted t'ron~ (l\]earst, 
\]997) (section (i). 
2.5 Speech. reeog l f i zer  e r rors

reduce the likelihood of extra.eting passages with a 
larger amount of word lnisreeognitions (Zeclmer and 
\Vaibel, 201111). lu this 1)aper, however, the focus will 
be exclusively on results of our evaluations on hu- 
man generated transcripts. No information from the 
speech recognizer nor from the acoustic signal (other 
than inter-utterance pause durations) are used. We 
are aware that in particular prosodic information 
may be of help for tasks such as the detection of 
sentence boundaries, speech acts, or topic bound- 
aries (l\]irschberg ~md Nakatani, 1998; Shriberg et 
al., 1998; Stolcke et al, 2000), but the investigation 
of the integration of this additional source of i n fer  
marion is beyond the scope of this pal)er and lel't tbr 
future work.

turn linking; clean-up filter; topic segmentation; and 
information condensation. A. fifth component is 
added a.t the end for the purpose of telegraphic re- 
duction, so that we can maximize the information 
content in a given amount of space. The system ar- 
chitecture is shown in Figure 1. It also indicates the 
three major types of smnmaries which can be gener- 
ated by l)Ia SUMM: 'P\]~ANS ("transcript"): not using 
the linking and clean-up components; CLEAN: ris- 
ing the main four components; 'I'EI,E ("telegraphic" 
summary): additionally, using the telegraphic reduc- 
tion component. 
The following sections describe the components of 
DIASUMM ill more detail. 
4 Turn  L ink ing  
The two main objectives of this component are: (i) 
to form turns which contain a set of full (and not 
partial) clauses; and (ii) to forln turn-pairs in cases 
where we have a question-answer pair in the dia- 
logue. 
To achieve the first objective, we scan the input for 
adjacent turns of one speaker and link them together 
if their time-stamp distance is below a pre-specified 
threshold 0. If the threshold is too small, we don't 
get most of the (logical) turn continuations across 
utterance boundaries, if it is too large, we run the 
risk of "skipping" over short but potentiMly relevant 
Daglnents of the speaker on the other channel. We 
experimented with thresholds between 0.0 and 2.0 
seconds and determined a local performance maxi- 
mum around 0 = 1..0. 
For the second objective, to form turn-pairs which 
comprise a question-answer information exchange 
between two dialogue participants, we need to detect 
wh- and yes-uo-questions i  the dialogue. We tested

two approa.ches: (a) a I tMM based speech a.ct (SA) 
classifier (\]/Jes, \] 999) and (b) a set of part-of-speech 
(POS) based rules. The SA classifier was trained oll 
dialogues which were manually annotated for speech 
acts, using parts of the SWITCIIBOARI) corpus (God- 
frey et al, 1992) for Fmglish and CALLIIOMF, for 
Spanish. The corresponding answers for the de- 
tected questions were hypothesized in the first turn 
with a. different sl)eaker , following the question-turn. 
Table 1 shows the results of these experiments for 5 
English and 5 Spanish CAI,L\]IOME dialogues, corn- 
payed to a baseline of randomly assigning n question 
speech acts, n being the number of question-turns 
marked by human a.nnotal~ors. We report Fl-seores, 
where F1 - ~ with P=preeision and /g--recall. 
We note that while the results \[br the SA-classifier 
and the rule-based approach are very similar for En- 
glish, the rule-based apl~roach yields better results 
tbr Spanish. The much higher random baseline for 
Spanish can be explained by the higher incidence of 
questions in the Spanish data (14.9?/(, vs. 5.3% for 
English). 
5 C lean-up  F i l te r  
The clean-up component is a sequence of modules 
which serve the purposes of (a) rendering the tran- 
scripts more readable, (b) simplifying the input for 
subsequent components, and (c) avoiding unwanted 
bias for relevance computations ( ee section 2). All 
this has to happen without losing essential informa- 
tion that could be relevant in a summary. While 
other work (\]\]eeman et al, 1996; Stolcke et al, 1998) 
was concerned with building classifiers that can de- 
tect and possibly correct wn:ious speech disfluencies, 
our implementntion is of a much simpler design. It 
does not require as much lnanual annota.ted train- 
ing data and uses individual components for every 
major category of disfluency.1 
t While we have not yet numerical ly evaluated the per fo f  
mance of this component,  its output  is deemed very natura l  to 
read by system users. Since the focus and goals of this contpo- 
nent are somewhat  different han l)reviotts work in that  area, 
meaningful  compar isons are hard to make.

Single or multiple word repetitions, fillers (e.g., 
"uhm"), and discourse markers without semantic 
content (e.g., "you know") a.re removed fl:om the in- 
put, some short forms axe expanded (e.g., "we'll" 
-+ "we will"), a.nd fl'cquent word sequences are 
combined into a single token (e.g., % lot of" -+ 
"a_lot_of"). 
Longer tm'ns are segmented into shorl clauses, 
which are defined a.s consisting of at least a. sub- 
ject and a.n inIlectcd verbal form. While (Stolcke 
and Shriberg, 1996) use n-gram models for this task, 
and (C~awald~t et al, 1997) use neura.l networks, we 
decided to use a. rule-based approach (using word 
a,nd POS information), whose performa.nce proved 
to be compat'able with the results in the cited \])~- 
pets (1,'~ > 0.85, error < 0.05). ~ 
leo, . several of tile clea.n-up filter's components, we 
ina.ke use of Brill's POS ta.gger (Ih:ill, I,(),qd). For 
Fmglish, we use ~t modified version of Brilt's original 
t~g set, and the tagger was adapted and retra.ined for 
Sl)oken langua.ge orl)ora, (CAIAAIOME a.lKl SWITCll-  
tlOalU)) (Zechner, 1997). For S1)anish, we crea.ted 
our own tag set., derived from the l,l)C lexicon and 
front the CI{ATEI/. project (LeOn, 1994), and trained 
the tagger on ma.nua.lly annotated (~;AI,I,IIOME dia-

6 Topic Segmentation 
,~illce CAI,I,IIOME dialogues are a.lways multi-topica.I, 
segmenting them into tOl)ical units is an important 
:;tel) in our summa.riza.tion system. '.l'his allows us 
to l)rovi(le "signature?' information (frcqllenl; coil-

Following (l{oguraev and Ii{cnnedy, 1997; Ba.rzi- 
la.y and Elhadad, 1997) who use 'l'extTiling (llcarst, 
1997) for their summa.riza.tion systems of written 
text,  we adapted this algorithm (it.s block compar- 
ison version) R)r sl)eech data: we choose turns to 
be minimal units a.nd compute block simila.rity be- 
tween l)locl(s of k turns every d turns. We use 9 
English and 15 Spanish @ALI,tIOMI,; dialogues, man- 
ually annota.ted for topic bounda.ries, to determine 
the optinmm wdues for a set of TextTiling pm:am- 
eters and ~t. the same time to eva.lua.te the accu-

results in (llea.rst, 1997) who reports a.n absolute im- 
provement of a, bout :20% over a, random baseline for

7 Information Condensation 
The informa,tion condensa, tion COml)onent is the core 
o\[' our sysl,en:~, lilts pUrl)OSe is to determine weights 
for terms and turns (or linked turn-i)airs ) and then 
to rank the turns a.ccording to their relewmce within 
each topical segment of the dialogue. 
For term-weighting, lf*idf-insl)ired formula.e 
(Sa.lton and Buckley, 1990) are used to empha.size 
words which are in the "middle range" of fl:equency 
in the dialogue a.nd do not a.pl)eat: in a. stop list. :~ 
For turn--ranking, we use a version of the "maximal 
n,argina.l relevance" (MMI{) algorithm (Ca.rbonell 
and Goldstein, 1998), where emphasis is given to 
liurns which conta.in ma.ny highly weighted terms tot" 
the current segment ("sa.lience") a.nd are sutficiently 
dissimila.r to previously ranked turns (to minimize 
redunda.ncy). 
For 9 English and l d Spanish dialogues, the "most 
relevant" turns were nmrl~ed lay hmnan coders. We 
ran a. series of cross-validation experiments o (a,) op- 
timize the parameters of this component related to

ish, 831 words.

how well this information condensing component can 
match tile human relewmce annotations. 
Summarization results are comlmted using 1 l-pt- 
avg precision scores t`or ranked turn lists where the 
maximum precision of the list of retrieved turns 
is averaged in the 11 evenly spaced intervals be- 
tween recall=\[0,0.1),\[0.1,0.2), . . \[1.0,1.:1)(Salton 
and McGill, 1.983). 4 Table 4 shows the results from 
these experiments. Similar to other experiments in
the summarization literature (Ma.ni et a.l., 1998), we 
find a wide performance variation across different 
texts. 
8 Telegraphic Reduction 
The purpose of this component is to maximize infor- 
mation in a tixed amount of space. We shorten the 
OUClmt of the summarizer to a "telegraphic style"; 
that way, more inrorma.tion can be included in a 
summary of k words (02: n bytes). Since we only 
use shallow methods for textual analysis that do 
not generate a. dependency structure, we cannot use 
complex methods for text reduction as described, 
e.g., in (Jing, 2000). Our method simply excludes 
words occurring in the stop list fl:om the summary, 
except for some highly inforlnative words such as 'T' 
or  ~11ot ~ . 
9 User  In ter face  and  System 
Per fo r lnance  
Since we want to enable interactive summarization 
which a.llows ~ user to browse through a dialogue 
qnickly Co search for information he is interested 
in, we have integrated our summarization system 
into a 3AVA-based graphical user interface ("Meet- 
ing Browser") (Bert et al, 2000). This interface also 
integrates the output of a speech recognizer (Yu et 
al., 1.999), and can display a wide variety of infer  
1nation about a conversation, including speech acts, 
dialogue games, and emotions. 
For sumlnarization, the user can determine the 
size of the summary and which topical segments 
he wants to have displayed. Ite can also rocus 
the summary on particular content words ("query- 
based summary")  or exclude words from considera- 
tion ("dynamic stop list expansion"). 
Smmnarizing a 10 minute segment of a CALL- 
hOME dialogue with our system takes on average less 
than 30 seconds on a 167 MHz 320 MB Sun Ultral 
workstation.S 
4 We are aware that  this annotat ion and evaluat ion scheme 
is far fl'om opt lmah it does neither reflect the fact that  turns 
are not necessari ly the best units for extract ion or that  the 
11-pt-avg precision score is not optimal ly suited for the sum- 
mar izat ion task. We thus have recently developed a new 
word-based method  for annotat ion  and evaluat ion of spon- 
taneous peech (Zechner, 2000). 
5The average was computed  over five English dialogues. 
10 Human Study  
1(1.1 Exper iment  Set;up 
Ill order to ewduate the system as a. whole, we con- 
ducted a study with humans in the loop to 1)e able Co 
colnpare three types of summaries (TITANS, CLEAN, 
TELE, see section 3) with the fllll original transcript. 
We address these two main questions in this study: 
(i) how fast can information be identified using dif- 
ferent types of summaries? (ii) how accurately is the 
information preserved, comparing different types of 
summaries? 
We did not only ask the user "narrow" questions 
for a specific piece of information - -  along the lines 
of the Q-A-evaluation part. of the SUMMAC confer- 
ence (Mani eC a.l., 1998) -- but also very "global", 
non-specific questions, tied Co a. parCicular (topical) 
segment of the dialogue. 
The experiment was conducted as follows: Sub- 
jeers were given 24 texts each, aceompa.nied by either 
a generic question ("What is the topic of the discus- 
sion in this text segment?") or three specitic ques- 
tions (e.g., "Which clothes did speaker A buy.'?"). 
The texts were drawn from five topical segments 
each rrom five English CAIAAIOME dialogues. (; They 
have four difl>rent formats: (a) fldl transcripts (i.e., 
the transcript of the whole segment) (FULL); (b) 
summa.ry of the raw transcripts (without linking and 
clea.n--up) ('rll.aNS); (c) cleaned-up summary (using 
all four major components of our  sys ten l )  (C,I,I,;AN); 
and (d) telegram suln21\]a, ry (der ived  r ron \ ]  (c),  us ing  
also Cite Celegraphic reduct.ion component) (TI';LE). 
'l'he texts or for,,,a.t,, (b), (c), a.nd (d) were gener- 
ated 1;o have the saaue length: 40% of (a), i.e., we 
use a 60% reduction rate. All these formats can 
be accotnpanied by either a. generic or three specitic 
questions: hence there are eight types of tasks for 
each of the 24: texts. 
We divided the subjects in eight groups such that 
no subject had to l)erform more than one task on 
the same text and we distributed the different Casks 
evenly \['or each group. Thus we cau make unbiased 
comparisons across texts and tasks. 
The answer accuracy vs. a pre-defined answer key 
was manually assessed on a 6 point discrete scale 
between 0.0 and 1.0. 
10.2 ll,esults and Discussion 
Of the 27 subjects taking part in this experiment, 
we included 24 subjects iu the evaluation; 3 sub- 
jects were excluded who were extreme outliers with 
respect o average answer time or score (not within 
/* + -2sCddev). 
From the results in Table 5 we observe the fol- 
lowing trends with respect to answer accuracy and 
response time: 
SOne of the 25 segments  was set aside for demonst rat ion  
purposes.

1 1 Summary  and  l g l tu re  Work  
\Ve have presented a sunmmrizat ion sysl,e~ for six) 
ken dialogues which is constructed to address key 
difl)renees of spolcen vs. written langua.ge, dia.logues 
vs. monologues, and inul|.i-topical vs. mono-topical  
texts. The system cleans up the input for speech 
disfluencies, links t.urns together into coherent in- 
formation units, determines tOlfica.l segments, and 
extracts the most relevant pieces of informal, ion in 
a user-customiza.ble way. I~;vahml,ions of major sys- 
tem (:Oral)Orients and of t.he systeJn as a. whole were 
1)erfornmd. 'l'hc results of a user sl, udy show that 
with a. sutmna ry size of d0%, between 71% and 911% 
of the inlbrma.tion of the fill\] text is ret.a.ined in the 
summary,  depending on tile type of summary  and 
tim Lyl)('s of quest, ions being asked. 
\?c' are currently extending the system to be able 
to ha.ndle different levels of granularity for extract;ion 
(clauses, sentences, turns), leurthermore, we plan to 
investigate the, integration of l)rosodic information 
into several (-onq)onents of our system.
