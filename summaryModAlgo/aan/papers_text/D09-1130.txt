Abstract
In this paper, we present a semi-supervised
method for automatic speech act recogni-
tion in email and forums. The major chal-
lenge of this task is due to lack of labeled
data in these two genres. Our method
leverages labeled data in the Switchboard-
DAMSL and the Meeting Recorder Dia-
log Act database and applies simple do-
main adaptation techniques over a large
amount of unlabeled email and forum data
to address this problem. Our method uses
automatically extracted features such as
phrases and dependency trees, called sub-
tree features, for semi-supervised learn-
ing. Empirical results demonstrate that
our model is effective in email and forum
speech act recognition.
1 Introduction
Email and online forums are important social me-
dia. For example, thousands of emails and posts
are created daily in online communities, e.g.,
Usenet newsgroups or the TripAdvisor travel fo-
rum
1
, in which users interact with each other us-
ing emails/posts in complicated ways in discus-
sion threads. To uncover the rich interactions in
these email exchanges and forum discussions, we
propose to apply speech act recognition to email
and forum threads.
Despite extensive studies of speech act recogni-
tion in many areas, developing speech act recogni-
tion for online forms of conversation is very chal-
lenging. A major challenge is that emails and
forums usually have no labeled data for training
statistical speech act recognizers. Fortunately, la-
beled speech act data are available in other do-
mains (i.e., telephone and meeting conversations

This work was conducted during the author?s internship

in this paper) and large unlabeled data sets can be
collected from the Web. Thus, we focus on the
problem of how to accurately recognize speech
acts in emails and forums by making maximum
use of data from existing resources.
Recently, there are increasing interests in
speech act recognition of online text-based con-
versations. Analysis of speech acts for online
chat and instant messages and have been studied
in computer-mediated communication (CMC) and
distance learning (Twitchell et al, 2004; Nastri et
al., 2006; Ros?e et al, 2008). In natural language
processing, Cohen et al (2004) and Feng et al
(2006) used speech acts to capture the intentional
focus of emails and discussion boards. However,
they assume that enough labeled data are available
for developing speech act recognition models.
A main contribution of this paper is that we ad-
dress the problem of learning speech act recog-
nition in a semi-supervised way. To our knowl-
edge, this is the first use of semi-supervised speech
act recognition in emails and online forums. To
do this, we make use of labeled data from spo-
ken conversations (Jurafsky et al, 1997; Dhillon
et al, 2004). A second contribution is that our
model learns subtree features that constitute dis-
criminative patterns: for example, variable length
n-grams and partial dependency structures. There-
fore, our model can capture both local features
such as n-grams and non-local dependencies. In
this paper, we extend subtree pattern mining to the
semi-supervised learning problem.
This paper is structured as follows. Section 2
reviews prior work on speech act recognition and
Section 3 presents the problem statement and our
data sets. Section 4 describes a supervised method
of learning subtree features that shows the effec-
tiveness of subtree features on labeled data sets.
Section 5 proposes semi-supervised learning tech-
niques for speech act recognition and Section 6
demonstrates our method applied to email and on-
1250
line forum thread data. Section 7 concludes this
paper with future work.
2 Related Work
Speech act theory is fundamental to many stud-
ies in discourse analysis and pragmatics (Austin,
1962; Searle, 1969). A speech act is an illo-
cutionary act of conversation and reflects shal-
low discourse structures of language. Recent re-
search on spoken dialog processing has investi-
gated computational speech act models of human-
human and human-computer conversations (Stol-
cke et al, 2000) and applications of these mod-
els to CMC and distance learning (Twitchell et al,
2004; Nastri et al, 2006; Ros?e et al, 2008).
Our work in this paper is closely related to prior
work on email and forum speech act recognition.
Cohen et al (2004) proposed the notion of ?email
speech act? for classifying the intent of an email
sender. They defined verb and noun categories
for email speech acts and used supervised learn-
ing to recognize them. Feng et al (2006) pre-
sented a method of detecting conversation focus
based on the speech acts of messages in discus-
sion boards. Extending Feng et al (2006)?s work,
Ravi and Kim (2007) applied speech act classifi-
cation to detect unanswered questions. However,
none of these studies have focused on the semi-
supervised speech act recognition problem and ex-
amined their methods across different genres.
The speech processing community frequently
employs two large-scale corpora for speech act
annotation: Switchboard-DAMSL (SWBD) and
Meeting Recorder Dialog Act (MRDA). SWBD is
an annotation scheme and collection of labeled di-
alog act
2
data for telephone conversations (Juraf-
sky et al, 1997). The main purpose of SWBD is
to acquire stochastic discourse grammars for train-
ing better language models for automatic speech
recognition. More recently, an MRDA corpus has
been adapted from SWBD but its tag set for la-
beling meetings has been modified to better reflect
the types of interaction in multi-party face-to-face
meetings (Dhillon et al, 2004). These two corpora
have been extensively studied, e.g., (Stolcke et al,
2000; Ang et al, 2005; Galley et al, 2004). We
also use these for our experiments.

A dialog act is the meaning of an utterance at the level
of illocutionary force (Austin, 1962), and broadly covers the
speech act and adjacency pair (Stolcke et al, 2000). In this
paper, we use only the term ?speech act? for clarity.
This paper focuses on the problem of semi-
supervised speech act recognition. The goal of
semi-supervised learning techniques is to use aux-
iliary data to improve a model?s capability to rec-
ognize speech acts. The approach in Tur et al
(2005) presented semi-supervised learning to em-
ploy auxiliary unlabeled data in call classification,
and is closely related to our work. However, our
approach uses the most discriminative subtree fea-
tures, which is particularly attractive for reducing
the model?s size. Our problem setting is closely re-
lated to the domain adaptation problem (Ando and
Zhang, 2005), i.e., we seek to obtain a model that
analyzes target domains (emails and forums) by
adapting a method that analyzes source domains
(SWBD and MRDA). Recently, this type of do-
main adaptation has become an important topic in
natural language processing.
3 Problem Definition
3.1 Problem Statement
We define speech act recognition to be the task
that, given a sentence, maps it to one of the speech
act types. Figure 1 shows two examples of our
email and forum speech act recognition. E1?6 are
all sentences in an email message. F1?3, F4?5,
and F6 are three posts in a forum thread. A sen-
tence interacts alone or with others, for example,
F6 agrees with the previous post (F4?5). To gain
insight into our work, it is useful to consider that
E2, 3 and F1, 4, 6 are summaries of two dis-
courses. In particular, F1 denotes a question and
F4 and F6 are corresponding answers. More re-
cently, using speech acts has become an appealing
approach in summarizing the discussions (Galley
et al, 2004; McKeown et al, 2007).
Next, we define speech act category based on
MRDA. Dhillon et al (2004) included definitions
of speech acts for colloquial style interactions
(e.g., backchannel, disruption, and floorgrabber),
but these are not applicable in emails and forums.
After removing these categories, we define 12 tags
(Table 1). Dhillon et al (2004) provides detailed
descriptions of each tag. We note that our tag set
definition is different from (Cohen et al, 2004;
Feng et al, 2006; Ravi and Kim, 2007) for two
reasons. First, prior work primarily interested in
the domain-specific speech acts, but our work use
domain-independent speech act tags. Second, we
focus on speech act recognition on the sentence-
level.

The goal of semi-supervised speech act recogni-
tion is to learn a classifier using both labeled and
unlabeled data. We formally define our problem
as follows. Let x = {x
j
} be a forest, i.e., a set of
trees that represents a natural language structure,
for example, a sequence of words and a depen-
dency parse tree. We will describe this in more
detail in Section 4. Let y be a speech act. Then,
we define D
L
= {x
i
, y
i
}
n
i=1
as the set of labeled
training data, and D
U
= {x
i
}
l
i=n+1
as the set of
unlabeled training data where l = n+m and m is
the number of unlabeled data instances. Our goal
is to find a learning method to minimize the clas-
sification errors in D
L
and D
U
.
3.2 Data Preparation
In this paper, we separate labeled (D
L
) and un-
labeled data (D
U
). First we use SWBD
3
and
MRDA
4
as our labeled data. We automatically
3

map original annotations in SWBD and MRDA to
one of the 12 speech acts.
5
Inter-annotator agree-
ment ? in both data sets is ? 0.8 (Jurafsky et al,
1997; Dhillon et al, 2004). For evaluation pur-
poses, we divide labeled data into three sets: train-
ing, development, and evaluation sets (Table 2).
Of the 1,155 available conversations in the SWBD
corpus, we use 855 for training, 100 for devel-
opment, and 200 for evaluation. Among the 75
available meetings in the MRDA corpus, we ex-
clude two meetings of different natures (btr001
and btr002). Of the remaining meetings, we use
59 for training, 6 for development, and 8 for eval-
uation. Then we merge multi-segments utterances
that belong to the same speaker and then divide all
data sets into sentences.
As stated earlier, our unlabeled data consists
of email (EMAIL) and online forum (FORUM)
data. For the EMAIL set, we selected 22,391
emails from Enron data
6
(discussion threads,
all documents, and calendar folders). For the FO-
RUM set, we crawled 11,602 threads and 55,743
posts from the TripAdvisor travel forum site (Bei-
jing, Shanghai, and Hongkong forums). As our
evaluation sets, we used 40 email threads of the
BC3 corpus
7
for EMAIL and 100 threads selected
from the same travel forum site for FORUM. Ev-
ery sentences was automatically segmented by the
MSRA sentence boundary detector (Table 2). An-
notation was performed by two human annotators,
and inter-annotator agreements were ? = 0.79 for
EMAIL and ? = 0.73 for FORUM.
Overall performance of automatic evaluation
measures usually depends on the distribution of
tags. In both labeled and unlabeled sets, the most

4 Speech Act Recognition
Previous work in speech act recognition used a
large set of lexical features, e.g., bag-of-words,
bigrams and trigrams (Stolcke et al, 2000; Co-
hen et al, 2004; Ang et al, 2005; Ravi and Kim,
2007). However, these methods create a large
number of lexical features that might not be nec-
essary for speech act identification. For example,
a Wh-question ?What site should we use to book a
Beijing-Chonqing flight?? can be predicted by two
discriminative features, ?(<s>, WRB) ? QW?
and ?(?, </s>) ? QW? where <s> and </s>
are sentence start and end symbols, and WRB is
a part-of-speech tag that denotes a Wh-adverb.
In addition, useful features could be of various
lengths, i.e. not fixed length n-grams, and non-
adjacent. One key idea of this paper is a novel use
of subtree features to model these for speech act
recognition.
4.1 Exploiting Subtree Features
To exploit subtree features in our model, we use
a subtree pattern mining method proposed by
Kudo and Matsumoto (2004). We briefly intro-
duce this algorithm here. In Section 3.1, we de-
fined x = {x
j
} as the forest that is a set of trees.
More precisely, x
j
is a labeled ordered tree where
each node has its own label and is ordered left-
to-right. Several types of labeled ordered trees
Figure 3: Representations of tree: (a) bag-of-
words, (b) n-gram, (c) word pair, and (d) depen-
dency tree. A node denotes a word and a directed
edge indicates a parent-and-child relationship.
are possible (Figure 3). Note that S-expression
can be used instead for computation, for example
(a(b(c(d)))) for the n-gram (Figure 3(b)).
Moreover, we employ a combination of multiple
trees as the input of the subtree pattern mining al-
gorithm.
We extract subtree features from the forest set
{x
i
}. A subtree t is a tree if t ? x. For exam-
ple, (a), (a(b)), and (b(c(d))) are subtrees
of Figure 3(b). We define the subtree feature as a
weak learner:
f(y, t,x) ,
{
+y t ? x,
?y otherwise,
(1)
where we assume a binary case y ? Y =
{+1,?1} for simplicity. Even though the ap-
proach in Kudo and Matsumoto (2004) and ours
are simiar, there are two clear distinctions. First,
our method employs multiple tree structures, and
uses different constraints to generate subtree can-
didates. In this paper, we only restrict generating
1253
the dependency subtrees which should have 3 or
more nodes. Second, our method is of interest
for semi-supervised learning problems. To learn
subtree features, Kudo and Matsumoto (2004) as-
sumed supervised data {(x
i
, y
i
)}. Here, we de-
scribe the supervised learning method and will de-
scribe our semi-supervised method in Section 5.
4.2 Supervised Boosting Learning
Given training examples, we construct a ensem-
ble learner F (x) =
?
k
?
k
f(y
k
, t
k
,x), where ?
k
is a coefficient for linear combination. A final
classifier h(x) can be derived from the ensemble
learner, i.e., h(x) , sgn (F (x)). As an optimiza-
tion framework (Mason et al, 2000), the objective
of boosting learning is to find F such that the cost
of functional
C(F ) =
?
i?D
?
i
C[y
i
F (x
i
)] (2)
is minimized for some non-negative and monoton-
ically decreasing cost function C : R ? R and
the weight ?
i
? R
+
. In this paper, we use the
AdaBoost algorithm (Schapire and Singer, 1999);
thus the cost function is defined as C(z) = e
?z
.
Constructing an ensemble learner requires that
the user choose a base learner, f(y, t,x), to
maximize the inner product ???C(F ), f? (Ma-
son et al, 2000). Finding f(y, t,x) to maxi-
mize ???C(F ), f? is equivalent to searching for
f(y, t,x) to minimize 2

From Eq. 3, a proper base learner (i.e., subtree)
can be found by maximizing weighted gain, where

Thus, subtree mining is formulated as the prob-
lem of finding (

gain(t, y). We
need to search with respect to a non-monotonic
score function (Eq. 4), thus we use the monotonic

The subtree set is efficiently enumerated using a
branch-and-bound procedure based on ?(t) (Kudo

After finding an optimal base leaner, f(y?,

we need to set the coefficient ?

semble, F (x

. (6)
After K iterations, the boosting algorithm returns
the ensemble learner F (x) which consists of a set
of appropriate base learners f(y, t,x).
4.3 Evaluation on Labeled Data
We verified the effectiveness of using subtree fea-
tures on the SWBD and MRDA data sets. For
boosting learning, one typically assumes ?
i
= 1.
In addition, the number of iterations, which relates
to the number of patterns, was determined by a
development set. We also used a one-vs.-all strat-
egy for the multi-class problem. Precision and re-
call were computed and combined into micro- and
macro-averaged F
1
scores. The significance of our
results was evaluated using the McNemar paired
test (Gillick and Cox, 1989), which is based on in-
dividual labeling decisions to compare the correct-
ness of two models. All experiments were imple-
mented in C++ and executed in Windows XP on a
PC with a Dual 2.1 GHz Intel Core2 processor and
2.0 Gbyte of main memory.
1254
Figure 4: Comparison of different trees (SWBD)
We show that use of subtree features is ef-
fective to solve the supervised speech act recog-
nition problem. We also compared our model
with the state-of-the-art maximum entropy classi-
fier (MAXENT). We used bag-of-words, bigram
and trigram features for MAXENT, which mod-
eled 702k (SWBD) and 460k (MRDA) parameters
(i.e., patterns), and produced micro-averaged F
1
scores of 92.76 (macro-averaged F
1
= 63.54) for
SWBD and 82.48 (macro-averaged F
1
= 57.19)
for MRDA. In contrast, our method generated ap-
proximately 4k to 5k patterns on average with sim-
ilar or greater F
1
scores (Table 3); hence, com-
pared to MAXENT, our model requires fewer cal-
culations and is just as accurate.
The n-gram model (NGRAM) performed signif-
icantly better than the bag-of-words model (Mc-
Nemar test; p < 0.001) (Table 3). Unlike MAX-
ENT, NGRAM automatically selects a relevant set
of variable length n-gram features (i.e., phrase
features). To this set, we separately added two
syntax type features, part-of-speech tag n-gram
(POSTAG) and dependency parse tree (DEPTREE)
automatically parsed by Minipar
8
, and one dis-
course type feature, speaker n-gram (SPEAKER).
Although some micro-averaged F
1
are not statisti-
cally significant between the original NGRAM and
the models that include POSTAG, DEPTREE or
SPEAKER, macro-averaged F
1
values indicate that
minor classes can take advantage of other struc-
tures. For example, in the result of SWBD (Fig-
ure 4), DEPTREE and SPEAKER models help to
predict uncertain responses (U), whereas NGRAM
and POSTAG cannot do this.
5 Semi-supervised Learning
Our goal is to eventually make maximum use
of existing resources in SWBD and MRDA for
8
http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/?lindek/minipar.htm
email/forum speech act recognition. We call the
model trained on the mixed data of these two cor-
pora BASELINE. We use ALL features in con-
structing the BASELINE for the semi-supervised
experiments. While this model gave promising re-
sults using SWBD and MRDA, language used in
emails and forums differs from that used in spo-
ken conversation. For example, ?thanx? is an ex-
pression commonly used as a polite mechanism
in online communications. To adapt our model to
understand this type of difference between spoken
and online text-based conversations, we should in-
duce new patterns from unlabeled email and fo-
rum data. We describe here two methods of semi-
supervised learning.
5.1 Method 1: Bootstrapping
First, we bootstrap the BASELINE model using au-
tomatically predicted unlabeled examples. How-
ever, using all of the unlabeled data results in noisy
models; therefore filtering or selecting data is very
important in practice. To this end, we only select
similar examples by criterion, d(x
i
,x
j
) < r or k
nearest neighbors where x
i
? D
L
and x
j
? D
U
.
In practice, r or k are fixed. In our method, exam-
ples are represented by trees; hence we use a ?tree
edit distance? for calculating d(x
i
,x
j
) (Shasha
and Zhang, 1990). Selected examples are evalu-
ated using BASELINE, and using subtree pattern
mining runs on the augmented data (i.e. unla-
beled). We call this method BOOTSTRAP.
5.2 Method 2: Semi-supervised Boosting
Our second method is based on a principle of
semi-supervised boosting learning (Bennett et al,
2002). Because we have no supervised guidance
for D
U
, our objective functional to find F is de-
fined as:
C(F ) =
?
i?D
L
?
i
C[y
i
F (x
i
)] +
?
i?D
U
?
i
C[|F (x
i
)|]
(7)
This cost functional is non-differentiable. To
solve it, we introduce pseudo-labels y? where y? =
sgn(F (x)) and |F (x)| = y?F (x). Using the same
derivation in Section 4.2, we obtain the following
1255
gain function and update rules:
gain(t, y) =
?
i?D
L
y
i
w
i
f(y, t,x
i
)
+
?
i?D
U
y?
i
w
i
f(y, t,x
i
), (8)
w
i
=
{
?
i
? e
?y
i
F (x
i
)
i ? D
L
,
?
i
? e
?y?
i
F (x
i
)
i ? D
U
.
(9)
Intuitively, an unlabeled example that has a
high-confidence |F (x)| at the current step, will
probably receive more weight at the next step.
That is, similar instances become more impor-
tant when learning and mining subtrees. This
semi-supervised boosting learning iteratively gen-
erates pseudo-labels for unlabeled data and finds
the value of F that minimizes training errors (Ben-
nett et al, 2002). Also, the algorithm infers new
features from unlabeled data, and these features
are iteratively re-evaluated by the current ensem-
ble learner. We call this method SEMIBOOST.

6.1 Setting
We describe specific settings used in our exper-
iment. Because we have no development set,
we set the maximum number of iterations K at
10,000. At most K patterns can be extracted, but
this seldom happens because duplicated patterns
are merged. Typical settings for semi-supervised
boosting are ?
i
= 1 and ?
i
= 0.5, that is, we
penalize the weights for unlabeled data.
For efficiency, BASELINE model used 10% of
the SWBD and MRDA data, selected at random.
We observed that this data set does not degrade the
results of semi-supervised speech act recognition.
For BOOTSTRAP and SEMIBOOST, we selected
k = 100 nearest neighbors of unlabeled exam-
ples for each labeled example using tree edit dis-
tance, and then used 24,625 (SWBD) and 54,961
(MRDA) sentences for the semi-supervised set-
ting.
All trees were combined as described in Section
4.3 (ALL model). In EMAIL and FORUM data we
added different types of discourse features: mes-
sage type (e.g., initial or reply posts), authorship
(e.g., an identification of 2nd or 3rd posts written
by the same author), and relative position of a sen-
tence. In Figure 1, for example, F1?3 is an initial
post, and F4?5 and F6 are reply posts. Moreover,
F1, F4, and F6 are the first sentence in each post.

6.2 Result and Discussion
First, we show that our method of semi-supervised
learning can improve modeling of the speech
act of emails and forums. As our baseline,
BASELINE achieved a micro-averaged F
1
score
of ? 79 for both data sets. This implies that
SWBD and MRDA data are useful for our prob-
lem. Using unlabeled data, semi-supervised meth-
ods BOOTSTRAP and SEMIBOOST perform bet-
ter than BASELINE (Table 4; Figure 5). To verify
our claim, we evaluated the supervised speech act
recognition on EMAIL and FORUM evaluation
sets with 5-fold cross validation (SUPERVISED in
Table 4). In particular, our semi-supervised speech
act recognition is competitive with the supervised
model in FORUM data.
The difference in performance between super-
vised results in EMAIL and FORUM seems to
indicate that the latter is a more difficult data
set. However, our SEMIBOOST method were able
to come close to the supervised FORUM results
(81.76 vs. 83.67). This is also close to the range of
supervised MRDA data set (F
1
= 83.49 for ALL,
Table 3). Moreover, we analyzed a main reason of
why transfer results were competitive in the FO-
RUM but not in the EMAIL. This might be due
to the mismatch in the unlabeled data, that is, we
used different email collections, the BC3 corpus
(email communication of W3C on w3.org sites),
for evaluation while used Enron data for adaption.
We also conjecture that the discrepancy between
EMAIL and FORUM is probably due to the more
heterogeneous nature of the FORUM data where
anyone can post and reply while EMAIL (Enron or
1256

BC3) might have a more fix set of participants.
The improvement of less frequent tags is promi-
nent, for example 25% for action motivator (AC),
40% for polite mechanism (P), and 15% for rhetor-
ical question (QR) error rate reductions were
achieved in FORUM data (Figure 5(b)). There-
fore, the semi-supervised learning method is more
effective with small amounts of labeled data (i.e.,
less frequent annotations). We believe that despite
their relative rarity, these speech acts are more im-
portant than the statement (S) in some applica-
tions, e.g., summarization.
Next, we give a qualitative analysis for better
interpretation of our problem and results. Due to
limited space, we focus on FORUM data, which
can potentially be applied to many applications.
Of the top ranked patterns extracted by SEMI-
BOOST (Figure 6(a)), subtree patterns of n-gram,
part-of-speech, dependency parse trees are most
discriminative. The patterns from unlabeled data
have relatively lower ranks, but this is not surpris-
ing. This indicates that BASELINE model provides
the base knowledge for semi-supervised speech
act recognition. Also, unlabeled data for EMAIL
and FORUM help to induce new patterns or ad-
just the model?s parameters. As a result, the semi-
supervised method is better than the BASELINE
when an identical number of patterns is modeled
(Figure 6(b)). For this result, we conclude that our
method successfully transfers knowledge from a
source domain (i.e., SWBD and MRDA) to a tar-
get domain (i.e., EMAIL and FORUM); hence it
can be a solution to the domain adaption problem.
Finally, we determine the main reasons for error
(in SEMIBOOST), to gain insights that may allow
development of better models in future work (Fig-
ure 6(c)). We sorted speech act tags by their se-
mantics and partitioned the confusion matrix into
question type (Q*) and statement, which are two
high-level speech acts. Most errors occur in the
similar categories, that is, language usage in ques-
tion discourse is definitely distinct from that in
statement discourse. From this analysis, we be-
lieve that more advanced techniques (e.g. two-
stage classification and learning with hierarchy-
augmented loss) can improve our model.
7 Conclusion
Despite the increasing interest in online text-based
conversations, no study to date has investigated
semi-supervised speech act recognition in email
and forum threads. This paper has addressed the
problem of learning to recognize speech acts us-
ing labeled and unlabeled data. We have also con-
tributed to the development of a novel applica-
tion of boosting subtree mining. Empirical results
have demonstrated that semi-supervised learning
of speech act recognition with subtree features im-
proves the performance in email and forum data
sets. An attractive future direction is to exploit
prior knowledge for semi-supervised speech act
recognition. Druck et al (2008) described gen-
eralized expectation criteria in which a discrimi-
native model can employ the labeled features and
unlabeled instances. Using prior knowledge, we
expect that our model will effectively learn useful
patterns from unlabeled data.
As work progresses on analyzing online text-
based conversations such as emails, forums, and
online chats, the importance of developing models
for discourse without annotating much new data
will become more important. In the future, we
plan to explore other related problems such as ad-
jacency pairs (Levinson, 1983) and discourse pars-
ing (Soricut and Marcu, 2003) for large-scale on-
line forum data.
