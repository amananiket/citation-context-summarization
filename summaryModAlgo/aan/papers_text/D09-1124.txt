Abstract
In this paper, we address the task of cross-
lingual semantic relatedness. We intro-
duce a method that relies on the informa-
tion extracted from Wikipedia, by exploit-
ing the interlanguage links available be-
tween Wikipedia versions in multiple lan-
guages. Through experiments performed
on several language pairs, we show that
the method performs well, with a perfor-
mance comparable to monolingual mea-
sures of relatedness.
1 Motivation
Given the accelerated growth of the number of
multilingual documents on the Web and else-
where, the need for effective multilingual and
cross-lingual text processing techniques is becom-
ing increasingly important. In this paper, we
address the task of cross-lingual semantic relat-
edness, and introduce a method that relies on
Wikipedia in order to calculate the relatedness of
words across languages. For instance, given the
word factory in English and the word lavoratore
in Italian (En. worker), the method can measure
the relatedness of these two words despite the fact
that they belong to two different languages.
Measures of cross-language relatedness are use-
ful for a large number of applications, including
cross-language information retrieval (Nie et al,
1999; Monz and Dorr, 2005), cross-language text
classification (Gliozzo and Strapparava, 2006),
lexical choice in machine translation (Och and
Ney, 2000; Bangalore et al, 2007), induction
of translation lexicons (Schafer and Yarowsky,
2002), cross-language annotation and resource
projections to a second language (Riloff et al,
2002; Hwa et al, 2002; Mohammad et al, 2007).
The method we propose is based on a measure
of closeness between concept vectors automati-
cally built from Wikipedia, which are mapped via
the Wikipedia interlanguage links. Unlike previ-
ous methods for cross-language mapping, which
are typically limited by the availability of bilingual
dictionaries or parallel texts, the method proposed
in this paper can be used to measure the related-
ness of word pairs in any of the 250 languages for
which a Wikipedia version exists.
The paper is organized as follows. We first pro-
vide a brief overview of Wikipedia, followed by
a description of the method to build concept vec-
tors based on this encyclopedic resource. We then
show how these concept vectors can be mapped
across languages for a cross-lingual measure of
word relatedness. Through evaluations run on six
language pairs, connecting English, Spanish, Ara-
bic and Romanian, we show that the method is ef-
fective at capturing the cross-lingual relatedness of
words, with results comparable to the monolingual
measures of relatedness.
2 Wikipedia
Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia, represent-
ing the outcome of a continuous collaborative ef-
fort of a large number of volunteer contributors.
Virtually any Internet user can create or edit a
Wikipedia webpage, and this ?freedom of contri-
bution? has a positive impact on both the quantity
(fast-growing number of articles) and the quality
(potential errors are quickly corrected within the
collaborative environment) of this online resource.
The basic entry in Wikipedia is an article (or
page), which defines and describes an entity or
an event, and consists of a hypertext document
with hyperlinks to other pages within or outside
Wikipedia. The role of the hyperlinks is to guide
the reader to pages that provide additional infor-
mation about the entities or events mentioned in
an article. Articles are organized into categories,
which in turn are organized into hierarchies. For
instance, the article automobile is included in the
category vehicle, which in turn has a parent cate-

Each article in Wikipedia is uniquely referenced
by an identifier, consisting of one or more words
separated by spaces or underscores and occasion-
ally a parenthetical explanation. For example, the
article for bar with the meaning of ?counter for
drinks? has the unique identifier bar (counter).
Wikipedia editions are available for more than
250 languages, with a number of entries vary-
ing from a few pages to two millions articles or
more per language. Table 1 shows the ten largest
Wikipedias (as of December 2008), along with
the number of articles and approximate number of
contributors.1
Relevant for the work described in this paper are
the interlanguage links, which explicitly connect
articles in different languages. For instance, the
English article for bar (unit) is connected, among
others, to the Italian article bar (unit?a di misura)
and the Polish article bar (jednostka). On average,
about half of the articles in a Wikipedia version
include interlanguage links to articles in other lan-
guages. The number of interlanguage links per ar-
ticle varies from an average of five in the English
Wikipedia, to ten in the Spanish Wikipedia, and as
many as 23 in the Arabic Wikipedia.
3 Concept Vector Representations using
Explicit Semantic Analysis
To calculate the cross-lingual relatedness of two
words, we measure the closeness of their con-
cept vector representations, which are built from
Wikipedia using explicit semantic analysis (ESA).
Encyclopedic knowledge is typically organized
into concepts (or topics), each concept being
further described using definitions, examples,
1http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List of Wikipedias
#Grand Total
and possibly links to other concepts. ESA
(Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007) relies on the
distribution of words inside the encyclopedic de-
scriptions, and builds semantic representations for
a given word in the form of a vector of the encyclo-
pedic concepts in which the word appears. In this
vector representation, each encyclopedic concept
is assigned with a weight, calculated as the term
frequency of the given word inside the concept?s
article.
Formally, let C be the set of all the Wikipedia
concepts, and let a be any content word. We define
~a as the ESA concept vector of term a:
~a = {w
c
1
, w
c
2
...w
c
n
} , (1)
where w
c
i
is the weight of the concept c
i
with re-
spect to a. ESA assumes the weight w
c
i
to be the
term frequency tf
i
of the word a in the article cor-
responding to concept c
i
.
We use a revised version of the ESA algorithm.
The original ESA semantic relatedness between
the words in a given word pair a ? b is defined as
the cosine similarity between their corresponding
vectors:
Relatedness(a, b) =
~a ?
~
b
?~a?
?
?
?
~
b
?
?
?
. (2)
To illustrate, consider for example the construc-
tion of the ESA concept vector for the word bird.
The top ten concepts containing this word, along
with the associated weight (calculated using equa-
tion 7), are listed in table 2. Note that the the ESA
vector considers all the possible senses of bird, in-
cluding Bird as a surname as in e.g., ?Larry Bird.?

Table 2: Top ten Wikipedia concepts for the word
?bird?
In our ESA implementation, we make three
changes with respect to the original ESA algo-
rithm. First, we replace the cosine similarity with
1193
a Lesk-like metric (Lesk, 1986), which places less
emphasis on the distributional differences between
the vector weights and more emphasis on the over-
lap (mutual coverage) between the vector features,
and thus it is likely to be more appropriate for the
sparse ESA vectors, and for the possible asymme-
try between languages. Let a and b be two terms
with the corresponding ESA concept vectors ~A
and ~B respectively. Let A and B represent the sets
of concepts with a non-zero weight encountered in
~
A and ~B respectively. The coverage of ~A by ~B is
defined as:
G(
~
B|
~
A) =
?
i?B
w
a
i
(3)
and similarly, the coverage of ~B by ~A is:
G(
~
A|
~
B) =
?
i?A
w
b
i
(4)
where wa
i
and wb
i
represent the weight associ-
ated with concept c
i
in vectors ~A and ~B respec-
tively. By averaging these two asymmetric scores,
we redefine the relatedness as:
Relatedness(a, b) =
G(
~
B|
~
A) + G(
~
A|
~
B)
2
(5)
Second, we refine the ESA weighting schema
to account for the length of the articles describing
the concept. Since some concepts have lengthy
descriptions, they may be favored due to their high
term frequencies when compared to more compact
descriptions. To eliminate this bias, we calculate
the weight associated with a concept c
i
as follows:
w
c
i
= tf
i
? log(M/ |c
i
|), (6)
where tf
i
represents the term frequency of the
word a in concept c
i
, M is a constant representing
the maximum vocabulary size of Wikipedia con-
cepts, and |c
i
| is the size of the vocabulary used in
the description of concept c
i
.
Finally, we use the Wikipedia category graph
to promote category-type concepts in our feature
vectors. This is done by scaling the concept?s
weight by the inverse of the distance d
i
to the
root category. The concepts that are not categories
are treated as leaves, and therefore their weight is
scaled down by the inverse of the maximum depth
in the category graph. The resulting weighting
scheme is:
w
c
i
= tf
i
? log(M/ |c
i
|)/d
i
(7)
4 Cross-lingual Relatedness
We measure the relatedness of concepts in differ-
ent languages by using their ESA concept vector
representations in their own languages, along with
the Wikipedia interlanguage links that connect ar-
ticles written in a given language to their corre-
sponding Wikipedia articles in other languages.
For example, the English Wikipedia article moon
contains interlanguage links to Q ?

? in the Ara-
bic Wikipedia, luna in the Spanish Wikipedia, and
luna? in the Romanian Wikipedia. The interlan-
guage links can map concepts across languages,
and correspondingly map concept vector represen-
tations in different languages.
Formally, let C
x
and C
y
be the sets of all
Wikipedia concepts in languages x and y, with
corresponding translations in the y and x lan-
guages, respectively. If tr
xy
() is a translation
function that maps a concept c
i
? C
x
into the con-
cept c?
i
? C
y
via the interlanguage links, we can
write:
tr
xy
(c
i
) = c
?
i
, (8)
The projection of the ESA vector ~t from lan-
guage x onto y can be written as:
tr
xy
(
~
t) =
{
w
tr
xy
(c
1
)
...w
tr
xy
(c
n
)
}
. (9)
Using equations 5, 7, and 9, we can calculate the
cross-lingual semantic relatedness between any
two content terms a
x
and b
y
in given languages
x and y as:
sim(a
x
, b
y
) =
G(tr
yx
(
~
B)|
~
A) + G(
~
A|tr
yx
(
~
B))
2
.
(10)
Note that the weights assigned to Wikipedia
concepts inside the concept vectors are language
specific. That is, two Wikipedia concepts from
different languages, mapped via an interlanguage
link, can, and often do have different weights.
Intuitively, the relation described by the inter-
language links should be reflective and transi-
tive. However, due to Wikipedia?s editorial pol-
icy, which accredits users with the responsibility
1194
of maintaining the articles, these properties are not
always met. Table 3 shows real cases where the
transitive and the reflective properties fail due to
missing interlanguage links.

We solve this problem by iterating over the
translation tables and extracting all the missing
links by enforcing the reflectivity and the transi-
tivity properties. Table 4 shows the initial number
of interlanguage links and the discovered links for
the four languages used in our experiments. The
table also shows the coverage of the interlanguage
links, measured as the ratio between the total num-
ber of interlanguage links (initial plus discovered)
originating in the source language towards the tar-
get language, divided by the total number of arti-
cles in the source language.

5 Experiments and Evaluations
We run our experiments on four languages: En-
glish, Spanish, Romanian and Arabic. For each
of these languages, we use a Wikipedia down-
load from October 2008. The articles were pre-
processed using Wikipedia Miner (Milne, 2007)
to extract structural information such as general-
ity, and interlanguage links. Furthermore, arti-
cles were also processed to remove numerical con-
tent, as well as any characters not included in the
given language?s alphabet. The content words are
stemmed, and words shorter than three characters
are removed (a heuristic which we use as an ap-
proximation for stopword removal). Table 5 shows
the number of articles in each Wikipedia version
and the size of their vocabularies, as obtained af-
ter the pre-processing step.

Romanian 179, 440 623, 358
Table 5: Number of articles and size of vocabulary
for the four Wikipedia versions
After pre-processing, the articles are indexed
to generate the ESA concept vectors. From each
Wikipedia version, we also extract other features
including article titles, interlanguage links, and
Wikipedia category graphs. The interlanguage
links are further processed to recover any missing
links, as described in the previous section.
5.1 Data
For the evaluation, we build several cross-lingual
datasets based on the standard Miller-Charles
(Miller and Charles, 1998) and WordSimilarity-
353 (Finkelstein et al, 2001) English word relat-
edness datasets.
The Miller-Charles dataset (Miller and Charles,
1998) consists of 30-word pairs ranging from syn-
onymy pairs (e.g., car - automobile) to completely
unrelated terms (e.g., noon - string). The relat-
edness of each word pair was rated by 38 hu-
man subjects, using a scale from 0 (not-related)
to 4 (perfect synonymy). The dataset is avail-
able only in English and has been widely used
in previous semantic relatedness evaluations (e.g.,
(Resnik, 1995; Hughes and Ramage, 2007; Zesch
et al, 2008)).
The WordSimilarity-353 dataset (also known as
Finkelstein-353) (Finkelstein et al, 2001) consists
of 353 word pairs annotated by 13 human experts,
on a scale from 0 (unrelated) to 10 (very closely
related or identical). The Miller-Charles set is a
subset in the WordSimilarity-353 data set. Unlike
the Miller-Charles data set, which consists only of

single words, the WordSimilarity-353 set alo fea-
tures phrases (e.g., ?Wednesday news?), therefore
posing an additional degree of difficulty for a re-
latedness metric applied on this data.
Native speakers of Spanish, Romanian and Ara-
bic, who were also highly proficient in English,
were asked to translate the words in the two data
sets. The annotators were provided one word pair
at a time, and asked to provide the appropriate
translation for each word while taking into account
their relatedness within the word pair. The relat-
edness was meant as a hint to disambiguate the
words, when multiple translations were possible.
The annotators were also instructed not to use
multi-word expressions in their translations. They
were also allowed to use replacement words to
overcome slang or culturally-biased terms. For ex-
ample, in the case of the word pair dollar-buck,
annotators were allowed to use PA


2 as a transla-
tion for buck.
To test the ability of the bilingual judges to pro-
vide correct translations by using this annotation
setting, we carried out the following experiment.
We collected Spanish translations from five differ-
ent human judges, which were then merged into
a single selection based on the annotators? trans-
lation agreement; the merge was done by a sixth
human judge, who also played the role of adjudi-
cator when no agreement was reached between the
initial annotators.
Subsequently, five additional human experts re-
scored the word-pair Spanish translations by using
the same scale that was used in the construction of
the English data set. The correlation between the

Middle East.
relatedness scores assigned during this experiment
and the scores assigned in the original English ex-
periment was 0.86, indicating that the translations
provided by the bilingual judges were correct and
preserved the word relatedness.
For the translations provided by the five human
judges, in more than 74% of the cases at least three
human judges agreed on the same translation for a
word pair. When the judges did not provide iden-
tical translations, they typically used a close syn-
onym. The high agreement between their trans-
lations indicates that the annotation setting was
effective in pinpointing the correct translation for
each word, even in the case of ambiguous words.
Motivated by the validation of the annotation
setting obtained for Spanish, we used only one hu-
man annotator to collect the translations for Arabic
and Romanian. Table 6 shows examples of trans-
lations in the three languages for three word pairs
from our data sets.
Using these translations, we create six cross-
lingual data sets, one for each possible language
pair (English-Spanish, English-Arabic, English-
Romanian, Spanish-Arabic, Spanish-Romanian,
Arabic-Romanian). Given a source-target lan-
guage pair, a data set is created by first using the
source language for the first word and the target
language for the second word, and then reversing
the order, i.e., using the source language for the
second word and the target language for the first
word. The size of the data sets is thus doubled
in this way (e.g., the 30 word pairs in the English
Miller-Charles set are transformed into 60 word
pairs in the English-Spanish Miller-Charles set).
5.2 Results
We evaluate the cross-lingual measure of related-
ness on each of the six language pairs. For com-
parison purposes, we also evaluate the monolin-
gual relatedness on the four languages.
For the evaluation, we use the Pearson (r)
and Spearman (?) correlation coefficients, which
are the standard metrics used in the past for the
evaluation of semantic relatedness (Finkelstein et
1196
al., 2001; Zesch et al, 2008; Gabrilovich and
Markovitch, 2007). While the Pearson correla-
tion is highly dependent on the linear relationship
between the distributions in question, Spearman
mainly emphasizes the ability of the distributions
to maintain their relative ranking.
Tables 7 and 8 show the results of the evalua-
tions of the cross-lingual relatedness, when using
an ESA concept vector with a size of maximum
10,000 concepts.3

As a validation of our ESA implementation, we
compared the results obtained for the monolingual
English relatedness with other results reported in
the past for the same data sets. Gabrilovich and
Markovitch (2007) reported a Spearman correla-
tion of 0.72 for the Miller-Charles data set and
0.75 for the WordSimilarity-353 data set, respec-

tively. Zesch et al (2008) reported a Spear-
man correlation of 0.67 for the Miller-Charles set.
These values are comparable to the Spearman cor-
relation scores obtained in our experiments for the
English data sets (see Table 8), with a fairly large
improvement obtained on the Miller-Charles data
set when using our implementation.
6 Discussion
Overall, our method succeeds in capturing the
cross-lingual semantic relatedness between words.
As a point of comparison, one can use the mono-
lingual measures of relatedness as reflected by the
diagonals in Tables 7 and 8.
Looking at the monolingual evaluations, the re-
sults seem to be correlated with the Wikipedia size
for the corresponding language, with the English
measure scoring the highest. These results are not
surprising, given the direct relation between the
Wikipedia size and the sparseness of the ESA con-
cept vectors. A similar trend is observed for the
cross-lingual relatedness, with higher results ob-
tained for the languages with large Wikipedia ver-
sions (e.g., English-Spanish), and lower results for
the languages with a smaller size Wikipedia (e.g.,
Arabic-Spanish).
For comparison, we ran two additional experi-
ments. In the first experiment, we compared the
coverage of our cross-lingual relatedness method
to a direct use of the translation links available in
Wikipedia. The cross-lingual relatedness is turned
into a monolingual relatedness by using the in-
terlanguage Wikipedia links to translate the first
of the two words in a cross-lingual pair into the
language of the second word in the pair.4 From
the total of 433 word pairs available in the two
data sets, this method can produce translations
for an average of 103 word pairs per language
pair. This means that the direct Wikipedia inter-
language links allow the cross-lingual relatedness
measure to be transformed into a monolingual re-
latedness in about 24% of the cases, which is a
low coverage compared to the full coverage that
can be obtained with our cross-lingual method of
relatedness.
In an attempt to raise the coverage of the trans-
lation, we ran a second experiment where we used
a state-of-the-art translation engine to translate the
first word in a pair into the language of the sec-

the initial and the discovered links, as described in Section 4.

ond word in the pair. We use Google Translate,
which is a statistical machine translation engine
that relies on large parallel corpora, to find the
most likely translation for a given word. Unlike
the previous experiment, this time we can achieve
full translation coverage, and thus we are able to
produce data sets of equal size that can be used
for a comparison between relatedness measures.
Specifically, using the translation produced by the
machine translation engine for the first word in a
pair, we calculate the relatedness within the space
of the language of the second word using a mono-
lingual ESA also based on Wikipedia. The results
obtained with this method are compared against
the results obtained with our cross-lingual ESA re-
latedness.
Using a Pearson correlation, our cross-lingual
relatedness method achieves an average score
across all six language pairs of 0.36 for the Miller-
Charles data set and 0.30 for the WordSimilarity-
353 data set,5 which is higher than the 0.33 and
0.28 scores achieved for the same data sets when
using a translation obtained with Google Trans-
late followed by a monolingual measure of re-
latedness. These results are encouraging, also
given that the translation-based method is limited
to those language pairs for which a translation en-
gine exists (e.g., Google Translate covers 40 lan-
guages), whereas our method can be applied to any
language pair from the set of 250 languages for
which a Wikipedia version exists.
To gain further insights, we also determined the
impact of the vector length in the ESA concept
vector representation, by calculating the Pearson
correlation for vectors of different lengths. Fig-
ures 1 and 2 show the Pearson score as a func-
tion of the vector length for the Miller-Charles
and WordSimilarity-353 data sets. The plots show
that the cross-lingual measure of relatedness is not
significantly affected by the reduction or increase
of the vector length. Thus, the use of vectors of
length 10,000 (as used in most of our experiments)
appears as a reasonable tradeoff between accuracy
and performance.
Furthermore, by comparing the performance of
the proposed Lesk-like model to the traditional
cosine-similarity (Figures 3 and 4), we note that
the Lesk-like model outperforms the cosine model
on most language pairs. We believe that this is

due to the stricter correlation conditions imposed
by the cosine-metric in such sparse vector-based
representations, as compared to the more relaxed
hypothesis used by the Lesk model.
Finally, we also looked at the relation between
the number of interlanguage links found for the
concepts in a vector and the length of the vector.
Figures 5 and 6 display the average number of in-
terlanguage links as a function of the concept vec-
tor length.
By analyzing the effect of the average number
of interlanguage links found per word in the given
datasets (Figures 5 and 6), we notice that these
links increase proportionally with the vector size,
as expected. However, this increase does not lead
to any significant improvements in accuracy (Fig-
ures 1 and 2). This implies that while the presence
of interlanguage links is a prerequisite for the mea-

7 Related Work
Measures of word relatedness were found useful in
a large number of natural language processing ap-
plications, including word sense disambiguation
(Patwardhan et al, 2003), synonym identification
(Turney, 2001), automated essay scoring (Foltz et
al., 1999), malapropism detection (Budanitsky and
Hirst, 2001), coreference resolution (Strube and
Ponzetto, 2006), and others. Most of the work to
date has focused on measures of word relatedness
for English, by using methods applied on knowl-
6Two languages with no interlanguage links between
them will lead to a relatedness score of zero for any word
pair across these languages, no matter how strongly related
the words are.

edge bases (Lesk, 1986; Wu and Palmer, 1994;
Resnik, 1995; Jiang and Conrath, 1997; Hughes
and Ramage, 2007) or on large corpora (Salton
et al, 1997; Landauer et al, 1998; Turney, 2001;
Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007).
Although to a lesser extent, measures of word
relatedness have also been applied on other lan-
guages, including German (Zesch et al, 2007;
Zesch et al, 2008; Mohammad et al, 2007), Chi-
nese (Wang et al, 2008), Dutch (Heylen et al,
2008) and others. Moreover, assuming resources
similar to those available for English, e.g., Word-
Net structures or large corpora, the measures of
relatedness developed for English can be in prin-
ciple applied to other languages as well.
All these methods proposed in the past have
been concerned with monolingual word related-
ness calculated within the boundaries of one lan-
guage, as opposed to cross-lingual relatedness,
which is the focus of our work.
The research area closest to the task of cross-
1199
lingual relatedness is perhaps cross-language in-
formation retrieval, which is concerned with
matching queries posed in one language to docu-
ment collections in a second language. Note how-
ever that most of the approaches to date for cross-
language information retrieval have been based on
direct translations obtained for words in the query
or in the documents, by using bilingual dictionar-
ies (Monz and Dorr, 2005) or parallel corpora (Nie
et al, 1999). Such explicit translations can iden-
tify a direct correspondence between words in two
languages (e.g., they will find that fabbrica (It.)
and factory (En.) are translations of each other),
but will not capture similarities of a different de-
gree (e.g., they will not find that lavoratore (It.;
worker in En.) is similar to factory (En.).
Also related are the areas of word alignment
for machine translation (Och and Ney, 2000),
induction of translation lexicons (Schafer and
Yarowsky, 2002), and cross-language annotation
projections to a second language (Riloff et al,
2002; Hwa et al, 2002; Mohammad et al,
2007). As with cross-language information re-
trieval, these areas have primarily considered di-
rect translations between words, rather than an en-
tire spectrum of relatedness, as we do in our work.
8 Conclusions
In this paper, we addressed the problem of
cross-lingual semantic relatedness, which is a
core task for a number of applications, includ-
ing cross-language information retrieval, cross-
language text classification, lexical choice for ma-
chine translation, cross-language projections of re-
sources and annotations, and others.
We introduced a method based on concept vec-
tors built from Wikipedia, which are mapped
across the interlanguage links available between
Wikipedia versions in multiple languages. Ex-
periments performed on six language pairs, con-
necting English, Spanish, Arabic and Romanian,
showed that the method is effective at captur-
ing the cross-lingual relatedness of words. The
method was shown to be competitive when com-
pared to methods based on a translation using the
direct Wikipedia links or using a statistical trans-
lation engine. Moreover, our method has wide ap-
plicability across languages, as it can be used for
any language pair from the set of 250 languages
for which a Wikipedia version exists.
