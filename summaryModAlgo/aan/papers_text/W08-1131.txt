Abstract
The TUNA Challenge was a set of three shared
tasks at REG?08, all of which used data from
the TUNA Corpus. The three tasks covered
attribute selection for referring expressions
(TUNA-AS), realisation (TUNA-R) and end-to-
end referring expression generation (TUNA-
REG). 8 teams submitted a total of 33 systems
to the three tasks, with an additional submis-
sion to the Open Track. The evaluation used
a range of automatically computed measures.
In addition, an evaluation experiment was car-
ried out using the peer outputs for the TUNA-
REG task. This report describes each task and
the evaluation methods used, and presents the
evaluation results.
1 Introduction
The TUNA Challenge 2008 built on the foundations
laid in the ASGRE 2007 Challenge (Belz and Gatt,
2007), which consisted of a single shared task, based
on a subset of the TUNA Corpus (Gatt et al, 2007).
The TUNA Corpus is a collection of human-authored
descriptions of a referent, paired with a represen-
tation of the domain in which that description was
elicited.
The 2008 Challenge expanded the scope of the
previous edition in a variety of ways. This year,
there were three shared tasks. TUNA-AS is the At-
tribute Selection task piloted in the 2007 ASGRE
Challenge, which involves the selection of a set of
attributes which are true of a target referent, and
help to distinguish it from its distractors in a do-
main. TUNA-R is a realisation task, involving the
mapping from attribute sets to linguistic descrip-
tions. TUNA-REG is an ?end to end? referring ex-
pression generation task, involving a mapping from
an input domain to a linguistic description of a target
referent. In addition, there was an Open Submission
Track, where participants were invited to submit a
report on any interesting research that involved the
shared task data, and an Evaluation Track, for which
submissions were invited on proposals for evalua-
tion methods. This year?s TUNA Challenge also ex-
panded considerably on the evaluation methods used
in the various tasks. The measures can be divided
into intrinsic, automatically computed methods, and
extrinsic measures obtained through a task-oriented
experiment involving human participants.
The training and development data for the Chal-
lenge included the full dataset used in the ASGRE
Challenge, that is, all of the 2007 training, develop-
ment and test data. For the 2008 edition, two new
test sets were constructed. Test Set 1 was used for
TUNA-R, Test Set 2 was used for both TUNA-AS and
TUNA-REG.
1.1 Overview of submissions
Overall, 8 research groups submitted 33 systems by
the deadline. Table 1 provides a summary of the sub-
missions. The extrinsic evaluation experiment was
carried out on peer outputs in the TUNA-REG task
only, using outputs from at most 4 systems per par-
ticipating group. The 10 systems included are indi-
cated in boldface in the table. An additional submis-
sion was made by the USP team to the Open Track.
No submissions were made to the Evaluation Track.
Given the number of submissions, space restrictions
do not permit us to give an overview of the charac-
teristics of the various systems; these can be found
in the reports authored by each participating group,
which are included in this volume.

Table 1: Overview of participating teams and systems, by task. TUNA-REG peer systems whose outputs were included
in the extrinsic, task-based evaluation are shown in boldface. Systems marked ? were submissions to TUNA-AS which
made use of the off-the-shelf ASGRE realiser for their entries to TUNA-REG.
Participants in TUNA-AS and TUNA-R were also
given the opportunity to submit peer outputs for
TUNA-REG, and having them included in the ex-
trinsic evaluation, by making the use of off-the-
shelf modules. For systems in TUNA-AS, we
made available a template-based realiser, written by
Irene Langkilde-Geary at the University of Brighton.
Originally used in the 2007 ASGRE Challenge, this
was re-used by some TUNA-AS participants to re-
alise their outputs. Systems which made use of this
facility are marked by a (*) in Table 1.
In the rest of this report, we first give an overview
of the tasks and the data used for the Challenge (Sec-
tion 2), followed by a description of the evaluation
methods (Section 3). Section 4 gives the compar-
ative evaluation results for each task, followed by
a few concluding remarks in Section 5. In what
follows, we will use the following terminology, in
keeping with their usage in Belz and Gatt (2007): a
peer system is a system submitted to the shared-task
challenge, while peer output is an attribute set or a
description (in the form of a word string) produced
by a peer system. We will refer to a description in
the TUNA corpus as a reference output.
2 Data and task overview
2.1 The TUNA Data
The TUNA corpus was constructed via an elicita-
tion experiment as part of the TUNA project1. Each
file in the data consists of a single pairing of a do-
main (representation of entities and their attributes)
and a human-authored description (reference output)

Figure 1: Format of corpus items
which is intended to describe the target referent in
the domain. Only the singular descriptions in the
corpus were used for the TUNA Challenge.
The descriptions in the corpus are subdivided by
entity type: there are references to people, and refer-
ences to furniture items. In addition, the elicitation
experiment manipulated a single condition, ?LOC.
In the +LOC condition, experimental participants
were told that they could refer to entities using any
of their properties, including their location. In the
?LOC condition, they were discouraged from doing
so, though not prevented.
Figure 1 is an outline of the XML format used in
the Challenge. Each file has a root TRIAL node
with a unique ID and an indication of the experi-
mental condition. The DOMAIN node subsumes 7
199
ENTITY nodes, which themselves subsume a num-
ber of ATTRIBUTE nodes defining the properties of
an entity in attribute-value notation. The attributes
include properties such as an object?s colour or a
person?s clothing, and the location of the image in
the visual display which the DOMAIN represents.
Each ENTITY node indicates whether it is the target
referent or one of the six distractors, and also has a
pointer to the image that it represents. Images were
made available to the TUNA Challenge participants.
The WORD-STRING is the actual de-
scription typed by a human author, and the
ATTRIBUTE-SET is the set of attributes belonging
to the referent that the description includes. The
ANNOTATED-WORD-STRING node was only
provided in the training and development data,
to display how substrings of a human-authored
description were mapped to attributes to determine
the ATTRIBUTE-SET.
Training and development data: For the TUNA
Challenge, the 780 singular corpus instances were
divided into 80% training data and 20% develop-
ment data. This data consists of all the training,
development and test data used in the 2007 ASGRE
Challenge.
Test data: Two new test sets were constructed by
replicating the original TUNA elicitation experi-
ment. The new experiment was designed to ensure
that each DOMAIN in the new test sets had two
reference outputs. Thus, this year?s corpus-based
evaluations are conducted against multiple instances
of each input DOMAIN. Both sets consisted of 112
items, divided equally into furniture and people
descriptions, sampled from both experimental
conditions (?LOC). Test Set 1 was used for the
TUNA-R Task. Participants in this task received a
version of the test set whose items consisted of a
DOMAIN node and an ATTRIBUTE-SET node.
There were 56 unique DOMAINs, each represented
twice in the test set, with two attribute sets from two
different human authors. Because each DOMAIN
and ATTRIBUTE-SET combination in this test
set is unique, the results for this task are reported
below over the whole of Test Set 1. Test Set 2
was used for the TUNA-AS and TUNA-REG Tasks.
For these tasks, the test items given to participants
consisted of a DOMAIN node only. There were
112 unique DOMAINs; the evaluations on these
tasks were conducted by comparing each peer
output to two different reference outputs for each
of these domains. Therefore, in the TUNA-AS and
TUNA-REG tasks, the data presented here averages
over the two outputs per DOMAIN.
2.2 The tasks
Task 1: Attribute Selection (TUNA-AS): The
TUNA-AS task focused on content determination for
referring expressions, and follows the basic prob-
lem definition used in much previous work in the
area: given a domain and a target referent, select a
subset of the attributes of that referent which will
help to distinguish it from its distractors. The inputs
for this task consisted of a TRIAL node enclosing a
DOMAIN node (a representation of entities and prop-
erties). A peer output was a TRIAL node enclos-
ing just an ATTRIBUTE-SET node whose children
were the attributes selected by a peer system for the
target entity.
Task 2: Realisation (TUNA-R): The TUNA-R task
focussed on realisation. The aim was to map an
ATTRIBUTE-SET node to a word string which de-
scribes the ENTITY that is marked as the target such
that the entity can be identified in the domain. The
inputs for this task consisted of a TRIAL node en-
closing a DOMAIN and an ATTRIBUTE-SET node.
A peer output for this task consisted of a TRIAL
node enclosing just a WORD-STRING node.
Task 3: ?End-to-end? Referring Expression Gen-
eration (TUNA-REG): For the TUNA-REG task, the
input consisted of a DOMAIN, and a peer output was
a word string which described the entity marked as
the target such that the entity could be identified in
the domain. The input for this task was identical to
that for TUNA-AS, i.e. a TRIAL node enclosing just
a DOMAIN node. A peer output for this task was
identical in format to that for the TUNA-R task, i.e. a
TRIAL enclosing just a WORD-STRING node.
3 Evaluation methods
The evaluation methods used in each task, and the
quality criteria that they assess, are summarised in
Table 2. Peer outputs from all tasks were evalu-
ated using intrinsic methods. All of these were au-
tomatically computed, and are subdivided into (a)

Table 2: Evaluation methods used per task
those measures that assess humanlikeness, i.e. the
degree of similarity between a peer output and a ref-
erence output; and (b) measures that assess intrin-
sic properties of peer outputs. Peer outputs from
the TUNA-REG task were also included in a human,
task-oriented evaluation, which is extrinsic insofar
as it measures the adequacy of a peer output in terms
of its utility in an externally defined task. In the re-
mainder of this section, we summarise the properties
of the intrinsic methods. Section 3.1 describes the
experiment conducted for the extrinsic evaluation.
Dice coefficient (TUNA-AS): This is a set-
comparison metric, ranging between 0 and 1, where
1 indicates a perfect match between sets. For two
attribute sets A and B, Dice is computed as follows:
Dice(A,B) =
2? |A ?B|
|A|+ |B|
(1)
MASI (TUNA-AS): The MASI score (Passonneau,
2006) is an adaptation of the Jaccard coefficient
which biases it in favour of similarity where one set
is a subset of the other. Like Dice, it ranges between
0 and 1, where 1 indicates a perfect match. It is com-
puted as follows:
MASI(A,B) = ? ?
|A ?B|
|A ?B|
(2)
where ? is a monotonicity coefficient defined as fol-
lows:
? =
?
???
???
0 if A ?B = ?
1 if A = B
2
3 if A ? B or B ? A
1
3 otherwise
(3)
Accuracy (all tasks): This is computed as the pro-
portion of the peer outputs of a system which have
an exact match to a reference output. In TUNA-AS,
Accuracy was computed as the proportion of times a
system returned an ATTRIBUTE-SET identical to
the reference ATTRIBUTE-SET produced by a hu-
man author for the same DOMAIN. In TUNA-R and
TUNA-REG, Accuracy was computed as the propor-
tion of times a peer WORD-STRING was identical
to the reference WORD-STRING produced by an au-
thor for the same DOMAIN.
String-edit distance (TUNA-R, TUNA-REG): This
is the classic Levenshtein distance measure, used to
compare the difference between a peer output and a
reference output in the corpus, as the minimal num-
ber of insertions, deletions and/or substitutions of
words required to transform one string into another.
The cost for insertions and deletions was set to 1,
that for substitutions to 2. Edit distance is an integer
bounded by the length of the longest description in
the pair being compared.
BLEU (TUNA-R, TUNA-REG): This is an n-gram
based string comparison measure, originally pro-
posed by Papineni et al (2002) for evaluation of
Machine Translation systems. It evaluates a system
based on the proportion of word n-grams (consid-
ering all n-grams of length n ? 4 is standard) that
it shares with several reference translations. Unlike
Dice, MASI and String-edit, BLEU is by definition an
aggregate measure (i.e. a single BLEU score is ob-
tained for a system based on the entire set of items
to be compared, and this is generally not equal to the
average of BLEU scores for individual items). BLEU
ranges between 0 and 1.
NIST (TUNA-R, TUNA-REG): This is a version of
BLEU, which gives more importance to less frequent
(hence more informative) n-grams. The range of
NIST scores depends on the size of the test set. Like
BLEU, this is an aggregate measure.
Uniqueness (TUNA-AS): This measure was in-
cluded for backwards comparability with the ASGRE
Challenge 2007. It is defined as the proportion of
peer ATTRIBUTE-SETs which identify the target
referent uniquely, i.e. whose (logical conjunction of)
201
attributes are true of the target, and of no other entity
in the DOMAIN.
Minimality (TUNA-AS): This measure was defined
as the proportion of peer ATTRIBUTE-SETs which
are minimal, where ?minimal? means that there is
no attribute-set which uniquely identifies the target
referent in the domain which is smaller. Note that
this definition includes Uniqueness as a prerequisite,
since the description must identify the target entity
uniquely in order to qualify for Minimality.
All intrinsic evaluation methods except for BLEU
and NIST were computed (a) overall, using the entire
test data set (i.e. Test Set 1 or 2 as appropriate); and
(b) by object type, that is, computing separate values
for outputs referring to targets of type furniture and
people.
3.1 Extrinsic evaluation in TUNA-REG
The experiment for the extrinsic evaluation of
TUNA-REG peer outputs combined a self-paced
reading and identification paradigm, comparing the
peer outputs from 10 of the TUNA-REG systems
shown in Table 1, as well as the two sets of human-
authored reference outputs for Test Set 2. We refer
to the latter as HUMAN-1 and HUMAN-2 in what fol-
lows2.
In the task given to experimental subjects, a trial
consisted of a description paired with a visual do-
main representation corresponding to an item in Test
Set 2. Each trial was split into two phases: (a) in an
initial reading phase, subjects were presented with
the description only. This phase was terminated by
subjects once they had read the description. (b) In
the second, identification phase, subjects saw the vi-
sual domain in which the description had been pro-
duced, consisting of images of the domain entities
in the same spatial configuration as that in the test
set DOMAIN. They clicked on the object that they
thought was the intended referent of the description
they had read.
The experiment yielded three dependent mea-
sures: (a) reading time (RT), measured from the
point at which the description was presented, to the
2Note that HUMAN-1 and HUMAN-2 were both sets of de-
scriptions randomly sampled from the data collected in the ex-
periment. Each set of human descriptions contains output from
different human authors.
point at which a participant called up the next screen
via mouse click; (b) identification time (IT), mea-
sured from the point at which pictures (the visual
domain) were presented on the screen to the point
where a participant identified a referent by clicking
on it; (c) error rate (ER), the proportion of times the
wrong referent was identified.
This design differs from that used in the 2007
ASGRE Challenge, in which descriptions and visual
domains were presented in a single phase (on the
same screen), so that RT and IT were conflated. The
new experiment replicates the methodology reported
in Gatt and Belz (2008), in a follow-up study on
the ASGRE 2007 data. Another difference between
the two experiments is that the current one is based
on peer outputs which are themselves realisations,
whereas the ASGRE experiment involved attribute
sets which had to be realised before they could be
used.
Design: We used a Repeated Latin Squares design,
in which each combination of SYSTEM3 and test set
item is allocated one trial. Since there were 12 lev-
els of SYSTEM, but 112 test set items, 8 randomly
selected items (4 furniture and 4 people) were du-
plicated, yielding 120 items and 10 12 ? 12 latin
squares. The items were divided into two sets of 60.
Half of the participants did the first 60 items (the first
5 latin squares), and the other half the second 60.
Participants and procedure: The experiment was
carried out by 24 participants recruited from among
the faculty and administrative staff of the Univer-
sity of Brighton, as well as from among the au-
thors? acquaintances. Participants carried out the
experiment under supervision in a quiet room on a
laptop. Stimulus presentation was carried out us-
ing DMDX, a Win-32 software package for psy-
cholinguistic experiments involving time measure-
ments (Forster and Forster, 2003). Participants initi-
ated each trial, which consisted of an initial warning
bell and a fixation point flashed on the screen for
1000ms. They then read the description and called
up the visual domain to identify the referent. Trials
timed out after 15000ms.
Treatment of outliers and timeouts: Trials which

cludes HUMAN-1 and HUMAN-2.

timed out with no response were discounted from
the analysis. Out of a total of (24 ? 60 =) 1440
trials, there were 4 reading timeouts (0.3%) and 7
identification timeouts (0.5%). Outliers for RT and
IT were defined as those exceeding a threshold of
mean ?2SD. There were 64 outliers on RT (4.4%)
and 191 on IT (13.3%). Outliers were replaced by
the overall mean for RT and IT (see Ratliff (1993)
for discussion of this method).
4 Evaluation results
This section presents results for each of the tasks.
For all measures, except BLEU and NIST, we present
separate descriptive statistics by entity type (people
vs. furniture subsets of the relevant test set), and
overall.
4.1 Results for TUNA-AS
Descriptive statistics are displayed for all systems in
Table 3. This includes the Accuracy and Minimal-
ity scores (proportions), and mean MASI and Dice
scores. Values are displayed by entity type and over-
all. The standard deviation for Dice and MASI is
displayed overall. Scores average over both sets of
reference outputs in Test Set 2. All systems scored
100% on Uniqueness, and either 0 or 100% on Min-
imality. These measures are therefore not included
in the significance testing, though Minimality is in-
cluded in the correlations reported below.
Two 15 (SYSTEM) ? 2 (ENTITY TYPE) uni-
variate ANOVAs were conducted on the Dice and
MASI scores. We report significant effects at p ?
.001. There were main effects of SYSTEM (Dice:
F (13, 1540) = 193.08; MASI: F (13, 1540) =
93.45) and ENTITY TYPE (Dice: F (1, 1540) =
91.75; MASI: F (1, 1540) = 168.12), as well
as a significant interaction between the two (Dice:
F (13, 1540) = 7.45, MASI: F (13, 1540) = 7.35).
Post-hoc Tukey?s comparisons on both Dice and
MASI yielded the homogeneous subsets displayed in
Table 4.
Differences among systems on Accuracy were
analysed by coding this as an indicator variable: for
each peer output, the variable indicated whether it
achieved perfect match with at least one of the two
reference outputs on the same DOMAIN. A Kruskall-
Wallis test showed that the difference between sys-
tems was significant (?2 = 275.01, p < .001).
Minimality Accuracy Dice MASI
Minimality -0.877 -0.959 -0.901
Accuracy -0.877 0.973 0.998
Dice -0.959 0.973 0.985
MASI -0.901 0.998 0.985
Table 5: Correlations for TUNA-AS; all values are signif-
icant at p ? .05
Pairwise correlations using Pearson?s r are shown
in Table 5, for all measures except Uniqueness. All
correlations are positive and significant, with the ex-
ception of those involving Minimality, which cor-
relates negatively with all other measures (i.e. the
higher the proportion of minimal descriptions of a
system, the lower its score on humanlikeness, as
measured by Dice, MASI and Accuracy). This re-
sult corroborates a similar finding in the 2007 AS-
GRE Challenge.
4.2 Results for TUNA-R
Table 6 shows descriptives for the 5 participating
systems in TUNA-R. Once again, mean Edit scores
and Accuracy proportions are shown both overall
and by entity type, while BLEU and NIST are overall
aggregate scores.
A 15 (SYSTEM) ? 2 (ENTITY TYPE) univariate
ANOVA was conducted on the Edit Distance scores.
There was no main effect of SYSTEM, and no in-
teraction, but ENTITY TYPE exhibited a main effect
(F (1, 550) = 19.99, p < .001). Given the lack of a
main effect, no post-hoc comparisons between sys-
tems were conducted. A Kruskall-Wallis test also
showed no difference between systems on Accu-
racy. Pairwise correlations between all measures are
shown in Table 7; this time, the only significant cor-
relation is between NIST and BLEU.

means for the intrinsic measures average over both
sets of reference outputs in Test Set 2.
A 15 (SYSTEM) ?2 (ENTITY TYPE) univariate
ANOVA was conducted on the Edit Distance scores.
There were significant main effects of SYSTEM
(F (13, 1540) = 8.6, p < .001) and ENTITY TYPE
(F (1, 1540) = 47.5, p < .001), as well as a signif-
icant interaction (F (13, 1540) = 5.77, p < .001).
A Kruskall-Wallis test on Accuracy, coded as an in-
dicator variable (see Section 4.2), showed that sys-
tems differed significantly on this measure as well
(?2 = 26.27, p < .05).
Post-hoc Tukey?s comparisons were conducted on
Edit Distance; the homogeneous subsets are shown
in Table 9. The table suggests that the main effect
of Edit Distance may largely have been due to the
204
difference between OSU-GP and all other systems.
Correlations between these measures are shown
in Table 10. Contrary to the results in Section 4.2,
the correlation between BLEU and NIST does not
reach significance. The negative correlations be-
tween Edit distance and Accuracy, and between Edit
and BLEU are as expected, since higher Edit cost im-
plies greater distance from a reference output.

4.3.2 Tests on the extrinsic measures
Table 11 displays the results for the extrinsic mea-
sures. Reading time (RT), identification time (IT)
and error rate (ER), are displayed only for the sys-
tems that participated in the evaluation experiment,
as well as for the two sets of reference outputs
HUMAN-1 and HUMAN-2.
Separate univariate ANOVAs were conducted test-
ing the effect of SYSTEM and ENTITY TYPE on IT
and RT. For IT, there was a significant main effect
of SYSTEM (F (11, 1409) = 5.66, p < .001) and
ENTITY TYPE (F (1, 1409) = 23.507, p < .001),
as well as a significant interaction (F (11, 1409) =
2.378, p < .05). The same pattern held for RT, with
a main effect of SYSTEM (F (11, 1412) = 9.95, p <
.001) and ENTITY TYPE (F (1, 1412) = 9.74, p <
.05) and a significant interaction (F (11, 1412) =
2.064, p < .05). A Kruskall-Wallis test conducted
on ER showed a significant impact of SYSTEM on the
extent to which experimental participants identified
the wrong referents (?2 = 35.45, p < .001). The
homogeneous subsets yielded by post-hoc Tukey?s
comparisons among systems, on both RT and IT, are
displayed in Table 12.
Finally, pairwise correlations were estimated be-
tween all three extrinsic measures. The only sig-
nificant correlation was between RT and IT (r =
.784, p < .05), suggesting that the longer experi-
mental subjects took to read a description, the longer
they also took to identify the target referent.
5 Conclusion
The first ASGRE Challenge, held in 2007, was re-
garded and presented as a pilot event, for a research
community in which there was growing interest in
comparative evaluation on shared datasets. Refer-
ring Expression Generation was an ideal starting
point, because of its relatively long history within
the NLG community, and the widespread agreement
on inputs, outputs and task definitions.
The tasks described and evaluated in this report
constitute a broadening of scope over the 2007 Chal-
lenge. Like the previous Challenge, the 2008 edition
emphasised diversity in terms of the measures of
quality used. This year, there was also an increased
emphasis on broadening the range of tasks, with the
inclusion of realisation and end-to-end referring ex-
pressions generation. This extends the scope of the
REG problem, which has traditionally been focussed
on content determination (attribute selection) for the
most part. As for evaluation, the diversity of mea-
sures can shed light on different aspects of quality
in these tasks. The fact that the correlation among
measures based on different quality criteria is not
straightforward is in itself an argument for maintain-
ing this diversity, particularly as comparative evalu-
ation exercises such as this one provide the oppor-
tunity for further investigation of the nature of these
relationships.
Another indicator of the growing diversity in this
year?s Challenge is the range of algorithmic solu-
tions in the three tasks, ranging from new models
based on classical algorithms, to data-driven meth-
ods, evolutionary algorithms, and graph- and tree-
based frameworks. The body of work represented
by submissions to the TUNA-R and TUNA-REG tasks
is also interesting for its exploration of how to apply

realisation techniques to the specific problem posed
by referring expressions.
The outcomes of this evaluation exercise are ob-
viously not intended to be a ?final word? on the right
way to carry out evaluation in referring expressions
generation. Rather, comparative results open up the
possibility of improvement and change. Another im-
portant aspect of a shared task of this nature is that
it results in an archive of data that can be further
exploited, either through follow-up studies, or for
the provision of baselines against which to compare
novel approaches. We have already used the data
from ASGRE 2007 for further investigation, particu-
larly in the area of extrinsic evaluation. We plan to
carry out more such studies in the future.
