Computational  L ingu is t i cs  i s  a sphere of sc ience and i t s  
app l i ca t ions  ly ing  between l tn~z ls t tos  and computer sc ience .

th is  task  i t s  two main d i rec t ions  are subordinated= natura~ 
language data  process ing ,  inc lud ing  machine t rans la t ion ,  and

des ign ing  a un i f ied  language,  z~ch enouKh to sat i s fy  d iverse  
computat ional  cond i t ions  a r i s ing  in  the above-mentioned 
app l i ca t ions  e 
As such a language we propose LZCOL CZ~nKua COmputatio- 
num ~Lngu?sticszsnn), an inev i tab ly  shor t  review of which i s  
g iven in  the present  repor t .  The l~Lst i c  approach to the 
desiKn of  th i s  language cons is ts  in  view~n~ i t  as a 8en~iotic 
system and forming i t s  un i te  in  accordance with R. Jekobson's  
l inguo-se~iot i c  funct ions .

const ruct ions  of LICOL presuppose a rather  broad range of

i n fo rmat ion  re t r ieva l ,  as a data descr ip t ion  and data  manipu l -  
a t ion  language in  data  base des ign  and as a programming lan6ua-  
ge in  the usua l  sense .  I t  i s  in tended as means fo r  de f in ing  
and cont ro l  both in  d ia log ica l  ( 'on - l ine)  and in  batch  (o f f -  
- l i ne )  p rocess ing .  
As a semiot i c  system LICOL cons is ts  of  s igns  - b i la te ra l  
ent i t ies  - composed by s ig~l f iants  (sequences  o f  le t te rs )  and 
s ign i f i6s  - those  ent i t ies  o f  rea l  or  conceptua l  wor ld which 
are  ob jec ts  and/or  means fo r  automat ic  p rocess ing .  The ro le  of  
s ign l f i6s  in  th i s  language can be p layed by the s ig~. i f i ants  
and by the s igns  of the same language.  This "wor ld  o f  lan~a6e"  
we name the system of i t s  concepts  the  re la t ions  of  which are 
express ib le  in  terms of  re la t ions  between the  s igns  of  the 
language.  To use LICOL, spec i f i ca lXy  to  program in  th i s  lan6ua-  
ge,  i s  to  express  one 's  thou~ht ,  knowledge, not ions  in  the 
framework of  the "wor ld  o f  LICOL" in  accordance w i th  the ru les  
of  i t s  grammar (syntax) .  In  th i s  language the  funct ion-ar~nnn- 
ant form i s  chosen as means fo r  ~ s ta t in~ re la t ions  between the  
concepts :  su f f i xa l  compound stems and pre f ixa l  and /or  su f f i xa l  
incorporated  synta6m8 , the  par t  o f  the su f f i xes  be in  6 p layed 
by names of  operat ions .  The notat ion  of  LICOL there fore  has 
the  re tersed  Po l i sh  form. 
S ince LICOL i s  a language fo r  computat ion,  the main 
concept of  i t s  "wor ld"  ( i .e .  the main s ign  o f  i t s  semiot i c  
system) is the notion of Computational Construction (CC). 
The CCs are constructional material both for the prO~TSme and 
the  data ,  the  under ly ing  form fo r  which are  IC t rees .  S ince 
the  t rees  are  eas i l y  representab le  in  a l inear  form by means 
of  the Po l i sh  form of notat ion ,  i t  i s  natura l  to  in terpret  
p ro te ins  as data  and v ice  versa ,  the data  be ing f rac tured  in to  
re la t iona l ly -h ie rarch ica l  data  network.  This  a l lows  to  cons ider  
the data  base a l so  as a data  base fo r  p rocedura l ly  represented  
knowledge and there fore  not to  draw d is t inc t ions  between the  
two main forms of data  representat ion  - a naming and a proce-  
dura l  one.

Aocoz.11ng to the type of signlfla,~ts the COs axe dlvld- 
ed into rep:esentln8 and processing co-structions, each of 
which are fu r ther  subdiv ided:  the represent ing  c lass  in to  
names and p ic tures  and the process ing  c lass  in to  cont ro l le rs  
and operat ions .  I f  the s i~Lf iant  i s ,  semiot tca l ly ,  a symbol, 
we have to do with a namin~ const ruct ion ,  i f  i t  i s  an i con ,  
we have a p ic ture  const ruct ion!  the index-s ign  represents  
e i ther  a cont ro l le r  or  an operat iona l  const ruct ion .  The s ign -  
i f i6e  for' the CCs are the so -ca l led  descr ip t ions  cons is t ing  
of 'a descr ip tor  (which corresponds to the concept of the 
s ign)  and of i t s  re fe rent  (va lue) .  
According to the  type of s ign i f i#s  the CCe are d iv ided 
in to  rea l ,  v i r tua l  and notat iona l  const ruct ions .  The rea l  CCe 
CozTespond to externa l  data  of the usua l  programming langua~.  
ee. They are s t ruc tured  in to  e lements ,  cha ins ,  f ie lds ,  re -  
cords,  f ragments ,  se ts  and bases .  The v i r tua l  OCs correspond 
to the user ' s  not ions  of p rocess ing  and are s t ruc tured  in to  
atoms, sequences,  t rees ,  ~un6hes (a rb i t ra ry  graphs) ,  b locks ,  
f i l es  and ( f i l e )  systems.  The not iona l  CCe correspond to con-  
e t i tu t ive  par ts  of ent i t les  of s i~mtf iante .  These are:  le t t -  
e rs ,  s t r ings ,  groups (of  s t r ings ) ,  segments,  modules,  corpus 
and packets (of  texts ) .  
Acco~ding to the form of va lue  the CCs can be subd iv id -  
ed in to  sca la rs ,  vectors  and l i s t s .  The sca la r  CCs have the 
fo l low ing  typess numbers, codes, log ica ls ,  f igures ,  symbols, 
keys,  re fe rences ,  descr ip tors  and masks. The not ion  of the 
vector  corresponds to one of a r ray ,  i t s  components may be not 
on ly  sca la rs  but a l so  vectors  or l i s t s ,  provided the i r  com- 
ponents are of the same type.  The l i s t s  may cons is t  of sea l -  
e rs ,  vectors  or sub l i s te  which may be of route ,  t ree ,  s t ruc t -  
ure or  execut ive  type.  
Such mul t ibase  c lass i f i ca t ion  of  the CCs has the fo l low-  
ing  sense .  The operat ions  of LICOL are def ined  on the v iz ' tua l  
CCs having ve.z"J.Ous or ig ins -  e i ther  netat iona l  ( textua l )  
- 19  - 
const i tuents  or denotat iona l ,  v i r tua l  and rea l  CCs. They may 
be in tended e i ther  fo r  d i sp lay ing  in  textua l  form, or  they 
may be used in  fu r ther  p rocess ing  as v i r tua l  ones,  or  they  
may be t ransmi t ted  in  externa l  environment in  the form of rea l  
CCe. 
The CCs can be de f ined  e i ther  by descr ip t ion  o f  the i r  
type and the mode of eva luat ing  or by a p ic ture ,  the s imp les t  
type of  which i s  a l i te ra l .  Two or  more CCs can be assoc ia ted  
together  one o f  them being an ob jec t  and the res t  of i t s  
features .  There are the fo l low ing  poss ib i l i t i es :  imp l i c i t  
t rans format ion  of  data from one type in to  another ;  ind i rec t  
de f in i t ions  of  operands! par t i c ipat ion  in  operat ions  by 
ob jec ts  and the i r  features  both separate ly  and Jo in t ly !  eva l -  
uat ion  of  the operands v ia  p ic tu~s ,  the operands may be the -  
reby  procedures .  D iverse  operat ions  on sequences ,  se ts ,  graphs 
w i th  labe l led  and un labe l led  nodes and arcs  are de f ined .  This  
a l lows  operat ing  both on the const i tuents  and dependences,  to  
form both the parad i~ns and synta~ms, to examine a l te rnat ives  
and to cont ro l  thAs process ing  by put t ing  d iverse  cond i t ions  
and res t r i c t ions  on eva luat ing  ob jec ts  by p ic tures  wi thout  
exp l i c i t  descr ip t ion  of  the process ing  sequence.  Spec i f i ca l l y ,  
some operat ions  on f i l es  and systems can be immediate ly  in ter -  
p re ted  as operat ions  on d ic t ionar ies .  
The system of  un i te  in  LICOL i s  de f ined  by a system of  
l inguosemiot ioa l  funct ions ,  i .e .  i t  i s  necessar i l y  c lose  to 
the s t ruc ture  of  funct ions  of  natura l  langunge,  spec i f i c  
features  of  programming are taken in to  cons iderat ion .  This 
a l lows to proceed from express ions  in  a natura l  language to  
express ions  in  LICOL, i .e .  the h ighest  funct ion  i s  fu l f i l l ed ,  
the msta lan~e~e funct ion ,  the ex is tence  of  which i s  ensured 
by the fu l f i lment  of  lower  funct ions :  the cogn i t ive  one, the 
oo- -nunicat ive one e tc .
