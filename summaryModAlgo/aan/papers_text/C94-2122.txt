Polysemy is one of the major causes of difficulties in se- 
lnantic clustering of words in a corpus. In this paper, 
we first; give a definition of polysemy from the view- 
point of clustering and then, b~rsed on this definition, 
we propose a clustering method which reeognises ver- 
bal 1)olysemics from a textual corpus. The results of 
experiments denmnstrate the effectiveness of the pro- 
I)osed method. 
1 In t roduct ion  
'\]?here has 1)een quite a h)t of research concerned with 
automatic lustering of semantically similar words or 
automatic recognition of colloc~rtions among them from 
eorl)ort~ \[Church, 1OVl\], \[Hindle, 1991\], \[Smadja, 1991\]. 
Most of this work is based on similarity measures de- 
rived fl'om the distrilmtion of woMs in corpora. How- 
ever, the Nets that a single word does have more than 
one meaning and that the distribution of a word in a 
corpus is a mixture of usages of different meanings of 
the same word often hamper such atteml~ts. 
The meaning of a word depends on the domain in 
which it is used; the sitme word c'an be use(l differently 
in different dolnains. It is also often the ease theft a 
word which is l/olysemous in general is not l)olysemous 
in a r(,strieted subject domain. In general, restriction 
of tllc subject domain makes the t)roblenl of 1)olysemy 
less l)rol)lematie. However, even in texts fronl a re- 
stricted domain such as Wall Street Journal l, one en- 
eount.ers quite a large nulnber of l)olyselnous words, in 
particular, unlike nouns, verbs are often i/olys(mwus 
ev(,n in a restricted subject domain. 
Because polysemous verbs are usually also high- 
frequency verbs, their treal:ment is crucial ill actual 
applications. Furthermore, beeause of their high- 
frequen(:y, polysemous verbs tend to have a harmflfl in- 
th,ence on the senlantic ehtstering of l/ollns, \])eeallSO se- 
mantic clustering of nollns is usually 1)eribrmed based 
on th(.ir eollo('ational 1)ehaviour with verbs.

Although polysemy is said to be widespread in lan- 
guage, the definition of polysemy is highly subjective. 
Polysemy can only be recognised by hunmn intuition 
and different linguists often identify a different number 
of  senses in the same word. In this paper, we first give a 
definition of polysemy fl'om the viewpoint of clustering, 
and propose an overlapping clustering method which 
automatically reeognises polysemous words. The re- 
sults of experiments are also given to demonstrate the 
effectiveness of our method. 
2 Re la ted  Work 
Although there have been several attempts to extract 
semantically similar words from a, given corpus, few 
studies seriously deal with the problenl of 1)olysemy; 
of these, even fewer are based on real texts. 
The techniques developed by Zernik \[Zernik, 1991\] 
and Brown \[Brown, 1991\] seem to cope with the dis- 
crimination of polysemy and 1)e ll~Lse(l on real texts. 
Zernik used monolingual texts which consist of about 
1 nfillion words tagged by 1)art-of-spee(:h. I~Iis method 
associates ca(-h word se.nse of a polysemous woM with 
a set of its co-occurring words. If a word has sew 
eral senses, then the word is assoeiated with several 
different sets of co-occurring words, each of which cor- 
responds to one of the senses of the word. The linfita- 
tion of Zernik's method, however, is that it solely re- 
lies on human intuition for identifying different senses 
of a word, i.e. the human editor tlas to determine, by 
her/his intuition, how many seilses a word has, and 
then identii~y the sets of co-occurring words (signa- 
t.lcres) that correspond to the different senses. 
Brown used bilingual texts, which consist of \]2 mil- 
lion words. The results of Brown's technique, when al)- 
plied to a French-English nmchine transb~tion system, 
seems to show its eflbctiveness and validity. However, 
as he admits, the at)preach is linfited because it can 
only assign at most two senses to a word. More seri- 
ously, 1)olysemy is defined in terms of translation, i.e. 
only when a word is Lranslated into two different words 
in a target language, it is recogniscd as polysemous. 
The apllroach can bc used only when a large 1)aral - 
lel corpus is awdhtble. Furthermore, individual senses 
thus identified (1(1 not neeessarily constitute single se- 
mantic units in the monolingual domain to which 1)lau- 
sible semantic prollertics (i.e. semantic rest;rictions, 
762 
colhlcations, etc.) can lie associated. 
The defects of these two methods how that it is cru- 
cial to have an N)pr()l)riate detinition of polyscmy in 
terms of distributimml 1)char|ours of words in mono- 
lingual texts. The approach proposed iu this paper 
focuses on this problem. Like Brown's apl)roach , our 
al)proach ad(lpts ;L rebttivist.ic vicw of polysclny. That  
is, ~ word is rccognised as l)olysenmus in terms of other 
relai.ed words..\[{owever, while Brown's al)l)roach idcn- 
tilies polysemous words in terms of rela~ted words of 
ram|her lmigui~gc, we. use semantically similar words 
of the same llmguage to identify polysemous words. 
Whether a word is polysemous or nol; depends on 
whether i~ set of other, semanti('Mly similar words ex- 
ists whose distrilmtional 1)eh~viours correspond to it 
sitbset of the distributionM behaviour of the word. 
Because tile distributional beiu~viour of it word is 
character|seal 1)y its co-occurring words, the t)rocess of 
identifying such subsets essentially correslmuds to 1.he 
1)rocess llcrformed manually by {:he hmnan edil.or in 
Zernik's approach. 
The experilmm~s in this p~ller use a corlluS &llllO- 
tal;ed only 1)y 1)art-ofsl)eech 1)ut not structurally an- 
notltl;cd. Howev(% the clustering algoritlm b which m> 
t(nna.ti(:ally recognises l)olysemous words, only ;~ssmnes 
that w(irds are semanl;ic~lly ch~tracterised by a vector 
ill a.n 't>(linmltsional space so that i{: c;tn 1)e al)l)lie.d to 
any data sa.tisf'ying this condition.

I1. is intuitively ol/vious that buy and sell are sema.nti- 
tally feb|ted and that the semantic ('loseness (if these

and t:herefore, sta.tistical clustering ~flgorithms can be 
~q)iilied to verb vectors in order to discover semantic 
classes of verbs. 
Ih)w(,ver, this strltigh(;forw~trd method is often ha,ln- 
pered by the existence, of 1)olysenmus words. The fol- 
lowing s(mtences show potysemous usages of t~rke.

We can nl~d(e the following obserwttions. 
1. take and buy in (s3) ,md (s3'), take and spend ill 
(s4) and (s,I'), t~tke and obt,6n in (s5) and (s5') 
co-occm' with the noun sl.ake, time ~tnd product, 
respectively, mid the verbs of each of these pairs 
\]utve almost the stone SPllSO. 
2. While certain usages of tttke have senses imilm' to 
buy, spend, ~tnd obt~tin, these three specific v(~x'l)s 
h~tve distinct, senses and we hardly see synonymy 
itmong these verbs. 
In the space spanned by the three axes, each ass()- 
ci~tted with stake, tim(', a.nd product, t.~tke does not 
constitute a clust.er with aaly of the three wu'bs, take 
co-occurs with the three iiO/lltS iLll(| hits high "m,u v;-tll|es 
with t.heni, while \]lily, spend lind obtain have high m,u 
values only with one of the three nmms. Therefore, I.he

three verbs correctly, oHe has to deconipose the vector

which corresponds to the three distinct usages of take. 
The decomposition of a vector into i~ set of its cOral)O- 
nent vectors requires i~ l)roller det:onqlosition of con- 
text in wlfich the wor(l occurs. Figure 1 shows tlw de- 
(:onq)osition of the verb take in the thl'ee-dimensional 
spaces, take l ,  take2,  iul(l take3  iLre the (:OmliO-

For the sltke of si,nplMty, we assume in |he ~d)ove

long to more than one cluster. However, these algo- 
rithms assume that ewm an entity which belongs to 
more than one clusters is still a single entity. An en- 
tity behmgs to several clusters because it can be seen 
from several different viewpoints. 'rite same entity, for 
example, egg, can be seen as food, like bread, and as 
ingredients-of-food, like flour, at the same time. 
However, as we saw in the above, polyselnous verbs 
can be captured more naturally by seeing them as mul- 
tiple entities, which hal)pen to take the same surface 
form. take l ,  take2 and take3 are distinct; entities 
(we (:all them hypothetical verbs in the following) with 
which different sets of nouns co-occur, and with which, 
therefore~ ditferent contexts are associated. 
Therefore, unlike standard overlapping clustering al- 
gorithms, our algorithm explicitly introduces new en- 
tities when an entity is judged polysemous and asso- 
ciates them with contexts which are subcontexts of 
the context of the original entity. Our algorithm has 
two basic operations, splittin9 and lumping. Splitt ing 
means to divide a polysemous verb into two hypothet- 
ical wwbs and lumping means to combine two hypo- 
theticai verbs to make one verb out of them. 
4 Measur ing  the  Compactness  
of a Group o f  Verbs  
The algorithm should decide when a verb has to he 
split into two hypothetical verbs. The decision is based 
on a measure of the sel-ilan~;ic compactness of a group 
of verbs. The semantic ompactness of a group of verbs 
is a measure which shows the degree of dispersion of 
the group in an n-dimensional space. The compactness 
of a group of verbs, VG= {vl, v2, ... ,  v,~}, is defined 
as follows. 
1. Let vi be one of the verbs v,, ? .., v,,, and a vector 
assigned to vi be (vii, " ", vm). Each vij(1 < j <_ 
n) is computed by the following formula. 
vii = mu(v i ,  t,j) if'mu(vi,n5) >_ a, 
0 otherwise (1) 
IIere, mu(vi ,  n j) is the vahle of mutual  informa- 
e t ion defined in \[Chur Jr, 1991\] between t~i and nj. 
c~ is a threshold value given in advance. 
2. The centre of gravity of a group of verbs, vl, ? ?., 
v , ,  is the mean vector of the vectors assigned to 
the verbs~ which is used to eompute the disper- 
sions of the individual verbs in the group. The 
(:entre of gravity ~ = (g t , ' " ,  g~), and the length 
of it I 9 \[, are defined as follows. 
(,?1,. ? ? ?~)  = ~ ' i~ , "  " - -  v i , , )  ' H?, 
i=l i=1 
tl  Wt 
(2) 
3. The dispersion, disp(v l , . . . ,~4~),  indicates the 
compaetness of a group and is def ined  ~ts: 
disp(vl ,"  " , v.~) = 
i=1 j=\ [  
4. Let us think of two clusters of verbs, A and B, 
which have the same degree of dispersions. If I g I 
of A is larger than that of B, the absolute vMue 
of mu calculated for A is larger than that of \]3. 
This means that the absolute probabilities of co- 
occurrences of each notln and the verbs of A is 
larger than those of B; zus a result, A shouhl be 
judged to be semantically more compact han B. 
Therefore, the dispersion of (3) is amrmalised ms: 
5. 
disp(v~,.  ., vm) 
~t , i .~ .>o,<, ,~, . . . ,  ~,,~) = I~1 (4) 
disp,~o,, of (4) is prolmrdonal to the number of 
verbs. This means that a cluster of a greater 
number of verbs tends to be judged to be less 
compact han those, of a smaller number of verbs. 
Therefore, the dispersion of (4) should be fl~rther 
normalised to compensatc the effect of the num- 
ber of verbs in a group. This normalisation is
done by least square estimation. The result is (5), 
which will be used to measure the COml)aetness of
a group of verbs. 
C'o , , , ( , ,~ ,  . . . , < ,~)  = , l i sv , , , . (  ,~ , , .  . . , , , , , ,  ) 
,8 * m - 7 (/3 = 0.964, 7 = 0.495) is a coetfi- 
eient that is eml)irically determined by least square 
est imation 2.
In the following, we use (5) as tlle wdue which shows 
the coml)actncss of a groul). A group with a smaller 
value of (5) is judged semantical ly more compact. 
2In this case, we set a' in ( \ [ )  equa\]s \[o 2{.0.
