1. The aim of the pro jec t  i s  to work out a method of 
reso lv ing  automattca.~ly the anaphor io ~euses  of s cer ta in  
c lass ,  in  par t i cu la r  those used in  fo rmulat ing  in terdocumentary  
c roesore fs renoes  in pr imary leSa l  texts  ( s ta tutory  texts ) .  By 
reso lv ing  an anaphor ic  c lause  of that  c lass  we mean the search-  
ing  cut poss ib ly  a l l  of i t s  re fe rends .  The t ,np lementat icn of 
the planned method should enable  the users  of the fu l l  tex t  
lega l  data  banks to obta in  in  search  operat ions ,  8part  from 
the doCumentS sat i s fy ing  the requ i rements  def ined in  the usua l  
quer r i ss ,  a l so  such documents to which the former exp l i c i t l y ,  
or even implicitly re fer .  The pro jec t  has been planned as one 
composed of th ree  par ts .  A repor t  on the resu l t s  of part  I was 
presented at  the F i f th  ICCH Conference in  Ann Arbor in  May 
1981. The present  text  aims at  showing the main out l ines  of 
the approach app l ied  in  par t  I I .  To make some aspects  of that  
par t  c lear ,  however, cer ta in  re ferences  must be made to par t  Iv  
Part  l l I  i s ,  as yet ,  at the eta~e of p re l iminary  d i scuss ions .  
2.  The genera l  approach app l ied  in  the whole of the pro-  
~eot i s  of  a semantic  k ind .  I t  has been assumed, in  par t i cu la r ,  
that  at  a cer ta in  leve l  of  genera l i za t ion  a l l  e lementary  ana-  
phor ic  c lauses  of the above c lass  ( le t  us ca l l  them the a -  
- c lauses)  have in  sp i te  of the d ivers i ty  of the i r  types ,  an 
- 273 - 
analogous semant ic  s t ruc ture ,  which can be represented  by the 
following diagremz 
the elementary a-clause 
the anaphor ic  functor  the  argument of the anaphor ic  functor  
the s tandard  the spec i f i ca t ion  
of  the argument of  the argument 
Consider the following fictitious example of a legal 
provision in which an elementary a-clause is inherent: 
"Art. 56. In cases when the price is to be paid in cash 
article 44 of the civil code should be applied." 
In art. 56 the a-functor is represented in the surface struct- 
ure by the phrase "should be applied", the argument by the 
phrase "article 44", the standard by the phrase "article" and 
the specification by the phrase "44". The role of the a-funot- 
or is confined to signalizin~ the fact that the clause in 
question has the illocutionary status of an anaphorlc utteran- 
ce, while that of the argument (and its immediate semantic 
oonstituens) consists in carrying information relevant to 
identifying the referende of that clause. Four types of the 
elementary a-clauses, in particular the type A (the explicit- 
ly addressing), the type D (the deictio), the type R (the 
implicitly referrlng) and the type S (the semantic) are dis- 
tingulshed. The distinction corresponds to four types of 
indication met in the clauses in question. By indication we 
mean the way in which referends of the a-clause are referred 
to  by i t .  
3- The operat ion  of  automated reso lv ing  of  an a -c lause  
can be conce ived of  as composed of four  s tages .  Stage 1 con-  
s i s ts  in  ident i fy ing  an a -c lause  of th i s  k ind w i th in  a de f in -  
i te  document (a r t i c le ,  paragraph , . . . ) ,  most ly  by recogn iz ing

fo r  the  se lec t ion  of  the most appropr ia te  search  procedures ,  
a re  ident i f ied  by the  program? This  s ta~e resu l t s  in  the  
generat ion  of  a formula  which i s  a genera l i zed  semant ic  re -  
p resentat ion  o f  the a@tu~ly  ana lyzed a -c lause .  Such a formu- 
la  ( the  SR-formula) i s  bu i l t  in  a spec i f i c  language of  semant-  
i c  representat ion  ( the  SR- language) ,  which i s  a l~nguage wi th  
a dras t i ca l l y  reduced vocabu lary  and a very  s imple syntax 
out l ined  in  par t  Z? At the s tage  2 on ly  the semant ic  p roper t -  
i es  accounted fo r  by the  spec i f i c  f rame- l i ke  in terpreta t ion  
scheme TS are taken in to  cons iderat ion .  Stage 3 cons is ts  in  
u t i l i z ing  the SR-formul~s,  generated  at the s tage  2, in  auto -  
mated se lec t ing  the search  procedures  to be employed at  the 
s tage  4. The se lec t ion  i s  made from among a set  o f  such pro-  
cedu~es e~pp l ied  by the cor respond ing  program? At the s tage  
4 the se lec ted  procedures  are employed in  the process  of  
search ing  out the re ferends  of  the ac tua l ly  ana lyzed anaphor io 
c lause  ( i .e .  the documents to  which i t  exp l i c i t l y  or  imp l i c i t -  
l y  re fe rs ) .  
4. The s imp les t  vers ion  o f  IS ,  to be used in  in terpret -  
ing  the e lementary  a -c lauses ,  ( i .e .  the a -c lauses  in  which 
only  a s ing le  ind icat ion  i s  inherent ) ,  can be conce ived of  as 
anl ordered pa i r  IT ! R~ , where T s tands fo r  a data  s t ruc tu -  
Ire (ca l led  " the  ladder" )  composed of 8 subsequent f ie lds  
( te~n ine ls )  a~d R fo r  a set  of  ru les  by which the operat ion  
of  f i l l i ng  out of  de f in i te  te rmina ls  i s  governed? According 
to  the  ru les  R two term?n~ls located  to the  fu r thest  le f t ,  
a re  dest ined  to car ry  infoz~nation on the type of  ind icat ion  
inherent  in  the ac tua l ly  ana lyzed e lementary  a -c lause .  The 
remain ing te rmina ls  (3-8)  account each fo r  a de~in~te semant-  
i c  p roper ty  of  such a c lause .  
5. By composed ~-c lauses  are meant those in  which more 
than a s in~e ind icat ion  are inherent .  Such c lauses  are 
- 275 - 
semant ica l l y  represented  by the composed fomulas  of  the  
SR- languags,  in  par t i cu la r  by a number of  f i l l ed  out " ladd-  
e rs" ,  connected by the use of  cer ta in  connect ives  of  the  
c lass ica l  ca lcu l i .  
6. The empi r i ca l  invest igat ions  which form the  sub jec t  
of  part  I I  were car r ied  cut  on a representat ive  sample o f  
the Po l i sh  s ta tutory  texts  o f  the  years  1944 - 1979. The 
research  aimed at  reconst ruc t ing  a l l  poss ib le  ways in  which 
the  semant ic  p roper t ies  of  a l l  k inds of  a -c lauses  may be re -  
p resented  in  the  or ig ina l  texts .  Such a reconst ruc t ion  was 
ind ispensab le  to  bu i ld ing  the  a lgor i thms of  t rans forming  the  
"natura l "  a -c lauses  in to  the  cor respond ing  SR- formulas ,  as 
we l l  as to  the  bu i ld ing  the poss ib ly  ~ i~ e f fec t ive  procedu-  
res  of  search ing  out the re ferend8 of  the ana lyzed a -c lauses .  
The research  resu l ted  in  formingz a) the l i s t s  o f  words 
which occur  in  the  phrases represent ing  in  the  sur face  
s t ruc ture  the correspond?ng semant ic  const i tuents  of  the  
~-o lansee  of  a l l  types ,  b) the  l i s t s  of  words which occur  
in  the phrases re f lec t ing  de f in i te  semant ic  p roper t ies  of  
such c lauses ,  and c) l i s t s  of  grammars reconst ruc t ing  the  
empi r i ca l l y  observed syntact i c  connect ions  between those  
words. Such a ws~7 of p resent ing  the resu l t s  o f  the  empi r i ca l  
invest igat ions  inherent  in  par t  I I  seems most su i tab le  fo r  
const ruc t ing  the  a forement ioned a lgor i thms and procedures .  
7 .  Part  I I I  of  the pro jec t  i s  concerned w i th  the ways 
o f  implement ing of  the planned method. Only a few of  the 
cor respond ing  a lgor i thms and procedures  have a l ready  been 
worked cut  by the authors .
