Abstract
We describe our experience in
developing a discourse-annotated
corpus for community-wide use.
Working in the framework of
Rhetorical Structure Theory, we were
able to create a large annotated
resource with very high consistency,
using a well-defined methodology and
protocol. This resource is made
publicly available through the
Linguistic Data Consortium to enable
researchers to develop empirically
grounded, discourse-specific
applications.
1 Introduction
The advent of large-scale collections of
annotated data has marked a paradigm shift in
the research community for natural language
processing. These corpora, now also common in
many languages, have accelerated development
efforts and energized the community.
Annotation ranges from broad characterization
of document-level information, such as topic or
relevance judgments (Voorhees and Harman,
1999; Wayne, 2000) to discrete analysis of a
wide range of linguistic phenomena. However,
rich theoretical approaches to discourse/text
analysis (Van Dijk and Kintsch, 1983; Meyer,
1985; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Mann and
Thompson, 1988) have yet to be applied on a
large scale. So far, the annotation of discourse
structure of documents has been applied
primarily to identifying topical segments
(Hearst, 1997), inter-sentential relations
(Nomoto and Matsumoto, 1999; Ts?ou et al,
2000), and hierarchical analyses of small
corpora (Moser and Moore, 1995; Marcu et al,
1999).
In this paper, we recount our experience in
developing a large resource with discourse-level
annotation for NLP research. Our main goal in
undertaking this effort was to create a reference
corpus for community-wide use. Two essential
considerations from the outset were that the
corpus needed to be consistently annotated, and
that it would be made publicly available through
the Linguistic Data Consortium for a nominal
fee to cover distribution costs. The paper
describes the challenges we faced in building a
corpus of this level of complexity and scope ?
including selection of theoretical approach,
annotation methodology, training, and quality
assurance. The resulting corpus contains 385
documents of American English selected from
the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al, 1993),
annotated in the framework of Rhetorical
Structure Theory. We believe this resource
holds great promise as a rich new source of text-
level information to support multiple lines of
research for language understanding
applications.
2 Framework
Two principle goals underpin the creation of this
discourse-tagged corpus: 1) The corpus should
be grounded in a particular theoretical approach,
and 2) it should be sufficiently large enough to
offer potential for wide-scale use ? including
linguistic analysis, training of statistical models
of discourse, and other computational linguistic
applications. These goals necessitated a number
of constraints to our approach. The theoretical
framework had to be practical and repeatable
over a large set of documents in a reasonable
amount of time, with a significant level of
consistency across annotators. Thus, our
approach contributes to the community quite
differently from detailed analyses of specific
discourse phenomena in depth, such as
anaphoric relations (Garside et al, 1997) or
style types (Leech et al, 1997); analysis of a
single text from multiple perspectives (Mann
and Thompson, 1992); or illustrations of a
theoretical model on a single representative text
(Britton and Black, 1985; Van Dijk and Kintsch,
1983).
Our annotation work is grounded in the
Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) framework
(Mann and Thompson, 1988). We decided to
use RST for three reasons:
? It is a framework that yields rich annotations
that uniformly capture intentional, semantic,
and textual features that are specific to a
given text.
? Previous research on annotating texts with
rhetorical structure trees (Marcu et al,
1999) has shown that texts can be annotated
by multiple judges at relatively high levels
of agreement. We aimed to produce
annotation protocols that would yield even
higher agreement figures.
? Previous research has shown that RST trees
can play a crucial role in building natural
language generation systems (Hovy, 1993;
Moore and Paris, 1993; Moore, 1995) and
text summarization systems (Marcu, 2000);
can be used to increase the naturalness of
machine translation outputs (Marcu et al
2000); and can be used to build essay-
scoring systems that provide students with
discourse-based feedback (Burstein et al,
2001). We suspect that RST trees can be
exploited successfully in the context of
other applications as well.
In the RST framework, the discourse
structure of a text can be represented as a tree
defined in terms of four aspects:
? The leaves of the tree correspond to text
fragments that represent the minimal units
of the discourse, called elementary
discourse units
? The internal nodes of the tree correspond to
contiguous text spans
? Each node is characterized by its nuclearity
? a nucleus indicates a more essential unit of
information, while a satellite indicates a
supporting or background unit of
information.
? Each node is characterized by a rhetorical
relation that holds between two or more
non-overlapping, adjacent text spans.
Relations can be of intentional, semantic, or
textual nature.
Below, we describe the protocol that we used
to build consistent RST annotations.
2.1 Segmenting Texts into Units
The first step in characterizing the discourse
structure of a text in our protocol is to determine
the elementary discourse units (EDUs), which
are the minimal building blocks of a discourse
tree. Mann and Thompson (1988, p. 244) state
that ?RST provides a general way to describe
the relations among clauses in a text, whether or
not they are grammatically or lexically
signalled.? Yet, applying this intuitive notion to
the task of producing a large, consistently
annotated corpus is extremely difficult, because
the boundary between discourse and syntax can
be very blurry. The examples below, which
range from two distinct sentences to a single
clause, all convey essentially the same meaning,
packaged in different ways:
1. [Xerox Corp.?s third-quarter net income
grew 6.2% on 7.3% higher revenue.] [This
earned mixed reviews from Wall Street
analysts.]
2. [Xerox Corp?s third-quarter net income
grew 6.2% on 7.3% higher revenue,] [which
earned mixed reviews from Wall Street
analysts.]
3. [Xerox Corp?s third-quarter net income
grew 6.2% on 7.3% higher revenue,]
[earning mixed reviews from Wall Street
analysts.]
4. [The 6.2% growth of Xerox Corp.?s third-
quarter net income on 7.3% higher revenue
earned mixed reviews from Wall Street
analysts.]
In Example 1, there is a consequential
relation between the first and second sentences.
Ideally, we would like to capture that kind of
rhetorical information regardless of the syntactic
form in which it is conveyed. However, as
examples 2-4 illustrate, separating rhetorical
from syntactic analysis is not always easy. It is
inevitable that any decision on how to bracket
elementary discourse units necessarily involves
some compromises.
Reseachers in the field have proposed a
number of competing hypotheses about what
constitutes an elementary discourse unit. While
some take the elementary units to be clauses
(Grimes, 1975; Givon, 1983; Longacre, 1983),
others take them to be prosodic units
(Hirschberg and Litman, 1993), turns of talk
(Sacks, 1974), sentences (Polanyi, 1988),
intentionally defined discourse segments (Grosz
and Sidner, 1986), or the ?contextually indexed
representation of information conveyed by a
semiotic gesture, asserting a single state of
affairs or partial state of affairs in a discourse
world,? (Polanyi, 1996, p.5). Regardless of their
theoretical stance, all agree that the elementary
discourse units are non-overlapping spans of
text.
Our goal was to find a balance between
granularity of tagging and ability to identify
units consistently on a large scale. In the end,
we chose the clause as the elementary unit of
discourse, using lexical and syntactic clues to
help determine boundaries:
5. [Although Mr. Freeman is retiring,] [he will
continue to work as a consultant for
American Express on a project basis.]wsj_1317
6. [Bond Corp., a brewing, property, media
and resources company, is selling many of
its assets] [to reduce its debts.]wsj_0630
However, clauses that are subjects, objects,
or complements of a main verb are not treated as
EDUs:
7. [Making computers smaller often means
sacrificing memory.]wsj_2387
8. [Insurers could see claims totaling nearly
$1 billion from the San Francisco
earthquake.]wsj_0675
Relative clauses, nominal postmodifiers, or
clauses that break up other legitimate EDUs, are
treated as embedded discourse units:
9. [The results underscore Sears?s difficulties]
[in implementing the ?everyday low
pricing? strategy?]wsj_1105
10. [The Bush Administration,] [trying to blunt
growing demands from Western Europe for
a relaxation of controls on exports to the
Soviet bloc,] [is questioning?]wsj_2326
Finally, a small number of phrasal EDUs are
allowed, provided that the phrase begins with a
strong discourse marker, such as because, in
spite of, as a result of, according to. We opted
for consistency in segmenting, sacrificing some
potentially discourse-relevant phrases in the
process.
2.2 Building up the Discourse Structure
Once the elementary units of discourse have
been determined, adjacent spans are linked
together via rhetorical relations creating a
hierarchical structure. Relations may be
mononuclear or multinuclear. Mononuclear
relations hold between two spans and reflect the
situation in which one span, the nucleus, is more
salient to the discourse structure, while the other
span, the satellite, represents supporting
information. Multinuclear relations hold among
two or more spans of equal weight in the
discourse structure. A total of 53 mononuclear
and 25 multinuclear relations were used for the
tagging of the RST Corpus. The final inventory
of rhetorical relations is data driven, and is
based on extensive analysis of the corpus.
Although this inventory is highly detailed,
annotators strongly preferred keeping a higher
level of granularity in the selections available to
them during the tagging process. More extensive
analysis of the final tagged corpus will
demonstrate the extent to which individual
relations that are similar in semantic content
were distinguished consistently during the
tagging process.
The 78 relations used in annotating the
corpus can be partitioned into 16 classes that
share some type of rhetorical meaning:
Attribution, Background, Cause, Comparison,
Condition, Contrast, Elaboration, Enablement,
Evaluation, Explanation, Joint, Manner-Means,
Topic-Comment, Summary, Temporal, Topic-
Change. For example, the class Explanation
includes the relations evidence, explanation-
argumentative, and reason, while Topic-
Comment includes problem-solution, question-
answer, statement-response, topic-comment, and
comment-topic. In addition, three relations are
used to impose structure on the tree: textual-
organization, span, and same-unit  (used to link
parts of units separated by embedded units or
spans).
3 Discourse Annotation Task
Our methodology for annotating the RST
Corpus builds on prior corpus work in the
Rhetorical Structure Theory framework by
Marcu et al (1999). Because the goal of this
effort was to build a high-quality, consistently
annotated reference corpus, the task required
that we employ people as annotators whose
primary professional experience was in the area
of language analysis and reporting, provide
extensive annotator training, and specify a
rigorous set of annotation guidelines.
3.1 Annotator Profile and Training
The annotators hired to build the corpus were all
professional language analysts with prior
experience in other types of data annotation.
They underwent extensive hands-on training,
which took place roughly in three phases.
During the orientation phase, the annotators
were introduced to the principles of Rhetorical
Structure Theory and the discourse-tagging tool
used for the project (Marcu et  al., 1999). The
tool enables an annotator to segment a text into
units, and then build up a hierarchical structure
of the discourse. In this stage of the training, the
focus was on segmenting hard copy texts into
EDUs, and learning the mechanics of the tool.
In the second phase, annotators began to
explore interpretations of discourse structure, by
independently tagging a short document, based
on an initial set of tagging guidelines, and then
meeting as a group to compare results. The
initial focus was on resolving segmentation
differences, but over time this shifted to
addressing issues of relations and nuclearity.
These exploratory sessions led to enhancements
in the tagging guidelines. To reinforce new
rules, annotators re-tagged the document.
During this process, we regularly tracked inter-
annotator agreement (see Section 4.2). In the
final phase, the annotation team concentrated on
ways to reduce differences by adopting some
heuristics for handling higher levels of the
discourse structure. Wiebe et al (1999) present
a method for automatically formulating a single
best tag when multiple judges disagree on
selecting between binary features. Because our
annotators had to select among multiple choices
at each stage of the discourse annotation
process, and because decisions made at one
stage influenced the decisions made during
subsequent stages, we could not apply Wiebe et
al.?s method.  Our methodology for determining
the ?best? guidelines was much more of a
consensus-building process, taking into
consideration multiple factors at each step. The
final tagging manual, over 80 pages in length,
contains extensive examples from the corpus to
illustrate text segmentation, nuclearity, selection
of relations, and discourse cues. The manual can
be downloaded from the following web site:
http://www.isi.edu/~marcu/discourse.
The actual tagging of the corpus progressed
in three developmental phases. During the initial
phase of about four months, the team created a
preliminary corpus of 100 tagged documents.
This was followed by a one-month reassessment
phase, during which we measured consistency
across the group on a select set of documents,
and refined the annotation rules. At this point,
we decided to proceed by pre-segmenting all of
the texts on hard copy, to ensure a higher overall
quality to the final corpus. Each text was pre-
segmented by two annotators; discrepancies
were resolved by the author of the tagging
guidelines. In the final phase (about six months)
all 100 documents were re-tagged with the new
approach and guidelines. The remainder of the
corpus was tagged in this manner.
3.2 Tagging Strategies
Annotators developed different strategies for
analyzing a document and building up the
corresponding discourse tree. There were two
basic orientations for document analysis ? hard
copy or graphical visualization with the tool.
Hard copy analysis ranged from jotting of notes
in the margins to marking up the document into
discourse segments. Those who preferred a
graphical orientation performed their analysis
simultaneously with building the discourse
structure, and were more likely to build the
discourse tree in chunks, rather than
incrementally.
We observed a variety of annotation styles
for the actual building of a discourse tree. Two
of the more representative styles are illustrated
below.
1. The annotator segments the text one unit at
a time, then incrementally builds up the

Figure 1: Discourse sub-tree for multiple sentences
discourse tree by immediately attaching the
current node to a previous node. When
building the tree in this fashion, the
annotator must anticipate the upcoming
discourse structure, possibly for a large
span. Yet, often an appropriate choice of
relation for an unseen segment may not be
obvious from the current (rightmost) unit
that needs to be attached. That is why
annotators typically used this approach on
short documents, but resorted to other
strategies for longer documents.
2. The annotator segments multiple units at a
time, then builds discourse sub-trees for
each sentence. Adjacent sentences are then
linked, and larger sub-trees begin to
emerge. The final tree is produced by
linking major chunks of the discourse
structure. This strategy allows the annotator
to see the emerging discourse structure more
globally; thus, it was the preferred approach
for longer documents.
Consider the text fragment below, consisting
of four sentences, and 11 EDUs:
[Still, analysts don?t expect the buy-back to
significantly affect per-share earnings in the
short term.]16 [The impact won?t be that great,]17
[said Graeme Lidgerwood of First Boston
Corp.]18 [This is in part because of the effect]19
[of having to average the number of shares
outstanding,]20 [she said.]21 [In addition,]22 [Mrs.
Lidgerwood said,]23 [Norfolk is likely to draw
down its cash initially]24 [to finance the
purchases]25 [and thus forfeit some interest
income.]26 wsj_1111
The discourse sub-tree for this text fragment
is given in Figure 1. Using Style 1 the annotator,
upon segmenting unit [17], must anticipate the
upcoming example relation, which spans units
[17-26]. However, even if the annotator selects
an incorrect relation at that point, the tool allows
great flexibility in changing the structure of the
tree later on.
Using Style 2, the annotator segments each
sentence, and builds up corresponding sub-trees
for spans [16], [17-18], [19-21] and [22-26]. The
second and third sub-trees are then linked via an
explanation-argumentative relation, after which,
the fourth sub-tree is linked via an elaboration-
additional relation. The resulting span [17-26] is
finally attached to node [16] as an example
satellite.
4 Quality Assurance
A number of steps were taken to ensure the
quality of the final discourse corpus. These
involved two types of tasks: checking the
validity of the trees and tracking inter-annotator
consistency.
4.1 Tree Validation Procedures
Annotators reviewed each tree for syntactic and
semantic validity. Syntactic checking involved
ensuring that the tree had a single root node and
comparing the tree to the document to check for
missing sentences or fragments from the end of
the text. Semantic checking involved reviewing
nuclearity assignments, as well as choice of
relation and level of attachment in the tree.  All
trees were checked with a discourse parser and
tree traversal program which often identified
errors undetected by the manual validation
process. In the end, all of the trees worked
successfully with these programs.
4.2 Measuring Consistency
We tracked inter-annotator agreement during
each phase of the project, using a method
developed by Marcu et al (1999) for computing
kappa statistics over hierarchical structures. The
kappa coefficient (Siegel and Castellan, 1988)
has been used extensively in previous empirical
studies of discourse (Carletta et al, 1997;
Flammia and Zue, 1995; Passonneau and
Litman, 1997). It measures pairwise agreement
among a set of coders who make category
judgments, correcting for chance expected
agreement. The method described in Marcu et
al. (1999) maps hierarchical structures into sets
of units that are labeled with categorial
judgments. The strengths and shortcomings of
the approach are also discussed in detail there.
Researchers in content analysis (Krippendorff,
1980) suggest that values of kappa > 0.8 reflect
very high agreement, while values between 0.6
and 0.8 reflect good agreement.
Table 1 shows average kappa statistics
reflecting the agreement of three annotators at
various stages of the tasks on selected
documents. Different sets of documents were
chosen for each stage, with no overlap in
documents. The statistics measure annotation
reliability at four levels: elementary discourse
units, hierarchical spans, hierarchical nuclearity
and hierarchical relation assignments.
At the unit level, the initial (April 00) scores
and final (January 01) scores represent
agreement on blind segmentation, and are
shown in boldface. The interim June and
November scores represent agreement on hard
copy pre-segmented texts. Notice that even with
pre-segmenting, the agreement on units is not
100% perfect, because of human errors that
occur in segmenting with the tool. As Table 1
shows, all levels demonstrate a marked
improvement from April to November (when
the final corpus was completed), ranging from
about 0.77 to 0.92 at the span level, from 0.70 to
0.88 at the nuclearity level, and from 0.60 to
0.79 at the relation level. In particular, when
relations are combined into the 16 rhetorically-
related classes discussed in Section 2.2, the
November results of the annotation process are
extremely good. The Fewer-Relations column
shows the improvement in scores on assigning

relations when they are grouped in this manner,
with November results ranging from 0.78 to
0.82. In order to see how much of the
improvement had to do with pre-segmenting, we
asked the same three annotators to annotate five
previously unseen documents in January,
without reference to a pre-segmented document.
The results of this experiment are given in the
last row of Table 1, and they reflect only a small
overall decline in performance from the
November results. These scores reflect very
strong agreement and represent a significant
improvement over previously reported results on
annotating multiple texts in the RST framework
(Marcu et al, 1999).
Table 2 reports final results for all pairs of
taggers who double-annotated four or more
documents, representing 30 out of the 53
documents that were double-tagged. Results are
based on pre-segmented documents.
Our team was able to reach a significant
level of consistency, even though they faced a
number of challenges which reflect differences
in the agreement scores at the various levels.
While operating under the constraints typical of
any theoretical approach in an applied
environment, the annotators faced a task in
which the complexity increased as support from
the guidelines tended to decrease. Thus, while
rules for segmenting were fairly precise,
annotators relied on heuristics requiring more
human judgment to assign relations and
nuclearity. Another factor is that the cognitive
challenge of the task increases as the tree takes
shape. It is relatively straightforward for the
annotator to make a decision on assignment of
nuclearity and relation at the inter-clausal level,
but this becomes more complex at the inter-
sentential level, and extremely difficult when
linking large segments.
This tension between task complexity and
guideline under-specification resulted from the
practical application of a theoretical model on a
broad scale. While other discourse theoretical
approaches posit distinctly different treatments
for various levels of the discourse (Van Dijk and
Kintsch, 1983; Meyer, 1985), RST relies on a
standard methodology to analyze the document
at all levels. The RST relation set is rich and the
concept of nuclearity, somewhat interpretive.
This gave our annotators more leeway in
interpreting the higher levels of the discourse
structure, thus introducing some stylistic
differences, which may prove an interesting
avenue of future research.
5 Corpus Details
The RST Corpus consists of 385 Wall Street
Journal articles from the Penn Treebank,
representing over 176,000 words of text. In
order to measure inter-annotator consistency, 53
of the documents (13.8%) were double-tagged.
The documents range in size from 31 to 2124
words, with an average of 458.14 words per
document. The final tagged corpus contains
21,789 EDUs with an average of 56.59 EDUs
per document. The average number of words per
EDU is 8.1.
The articles range over a variety of topics,
including financial reports, general interest
stories, business-related news, cultural reviews,
editorials, and letters to the editor. In selecting
these documents, we partnered with the
Linguistic Data Consortium to select Penn
Treebank texts for which the syntactic
bracketing was known to be of high caliber.
Thus, the RST Corpus provides an additional
level of linguistic annotation to supplement
existing annotated resources.

6 Discussion
A growing number of groups have developed or
are developing discourse-annotated corpora for
text. These can be characterized both in terms of
the kinds of features annotated as well as by the
scope of the annotation. Features may include
specific discourse cues or markers, coreference
links, identification of rhetorical relations, etc.
The scope of the annotation refers to the levels
of analysis within the document, and can be
characterized as follows:
? sentential: annotation of features at the
intra-sentential or inter-sentential level, at a
single level of depth  (Sundheim, 1995;
Tsou et al, 2000; Nomoto and Matsumoto,
1999; Rebeyrolle, 2000).
? hierarchical: annotation of features at
multiple levels, building upon lower levels
of analysis at the clause or sentence level
(Moser and Moore, 1995; Marcu, et al
1999)
? document-level: broad characterization of
document structure such as identification of
topical segments (Hearst, 1997), linking of
large text segments via specific relations
(Ferrari, 1998; Rebeyrolle, 2000), or
defining text objects with a text architecture
(Pery-Woodley and Rebeyrolle, 1998).
Developing corpora with these kinds of rich
annotation is a labor-intensive effort. Building
the RST Corpus involved more than a dozen
people on a full or part-time basis over a one-
year time frame (Jan. ? Dec. 2000). Annotation
of a single document could take anywhere from
30 minutes to several hours, depending on the
length and topic. Re-tagging of a large number
of documents after major enhancements to the
annotation guidelines was also time consuming.
In addition, limitations of the theoretical
approach became more apparent over time.
Because the RST theory does not differentiate
between different levels of the tree structure, a
fairly fine-grained set of relations operates
between EDUs and EDU clusters at the macro-
level. The procedural knowledge available at the
EDU level is likely to need further refinement
for higher-level text spans along the lines of
other work which posits a few macro-level
relations for text segments, such as Ferrari
(1998) or Meyer (1985).  Moreover, using the
RST approach, the resultant tree structure, like a
traditional outline, imposed constraints that
other discourse representations (e.g., graph)
would not. In combination with the tree
structure, the concept of nuclearity also guided
an annotator to capture one of a number of
possible stylistic interpretations. We ourselves
are eager to explore these aspects of the RST,
and expect new insights to appear through
analysis of the corpus.
We anticipate that the RST Corpus will be
multifunctional and support a wide range of
language engineering applications. The added
value of multiple layers of overt linguistic
phenomena enhancing the Penn Treebank
information can be exploited to advance the
study of discourse, to enhance language
technologies such as text summarization,
machine translation or information retrieval, or
to be a testbed for new and creative natural
language processing techniques.
