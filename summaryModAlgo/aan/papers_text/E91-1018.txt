Abstract 
This paper describes a method of analysing 
words through morphological decomposition 
when the lexicon is incomplete. The method is 
used within a text-to-speech system to help gen- 
erate pronunciations of unknown words. The 
method is achieved within a general morpho- 
logical analyser system using Koskenniemi two- 
level rules. 
Keywords:  Morphology, incomplete lexicon, 
text-to-speech systems 
Background 
When a text-to-speech synthesis system is used, 
it is likely that the text being processed will 
contain a few words which do not appear in 
the lexicon as entries in their own right. If 
the lexicon consists only of whole-word entries, 
then the method for producing a pronunciation 
for such "unknown ~ words is simply: to pass 
them through a set of letter-to-sound rules fol- 
lowed by word stress assignment rules and vowel 
reduction rules. The resulting pronunciation 
may well be inaccurate, particularly in English 
(which often shows a poor relationship between 
spelling and pronunciation). In addition, the 
default set of word classes assigned to the word 
(noun, verb, adjective) will be too general to 
be of much help to the syntactic parsing mod- 
ule. However, if the lexicon contains individual 
morphemes (both ~bound = and ~free'), an un- 
known word can be analysed into its constituent 
morphemes. Stress assignment rules will then 
be more likely to yield the correct pronuncia- 
tion, and any characteristic suffix that may be 
present will allow for the assignment of a more 
accurate word class or classes (eg. +ness de- 
notes a noun, +ly an adverb). Morphological 
analysis of words will therefore allow a signifi- 
cantly larger number of "unknown ~ words to be 
handled. Novel forms such as hamperance, and 
thatcher isat?on would probably not exist in a 
whole-word ictionary, but could be handled by 
morphological nalysis using existing morpho- 
logical entries. Also, the ability to deal with 
compound words would allow for significantly 
higher accuracy in pronunciation assignment. 
A problem arises, however, if one or more 
of the word's constituent morphemes are not 
present in the morphological dictionary. In this 
case, the morphological nalysis will fail, and 
the entire word will be passed to the letter-to- 
sound rules, with concomitant probable loss of 
accuracy in pronunciation assignment and word 
class assignment. It is far more likely that the 
missing morpheme will be a root morpheme 
rather than an affix, since the latter morphemes 
form a closed class which may be exhaustively 
listed, whereas the former form an open class 
which may be added to as the language volves 
(eg. ninj a, Chunnel, kluge, yomp). Therefore, 
it would be preferable if any closed-class mor- 
phemes in a (putatively) polymorphemic un- 
101 - 
known word could be recognised and separated 
from the remaining material, which would then 
be assumed to be a new root morpheme. Letter- 
to-sound rules would then be applied to this pu- 
tative new root morpheme (the pronunciation of 
the known material would be derived from the 
lexicon). 
The advantages of this method are that the 
pronunciation and word stress assignment are 
more likely to be accurate, and also that, if 
there is a suitable suIKx, the correct word class 
may be assigned (eg. in yomping, from yomp 
(unknown root) and +ing (known verb or noun 
suffix), which will be characterised as a verb 
or noun). Thus, in the case of preamble, the 
stripping of the prefix pre- will allow for the 
correct pronunciation/p r i i a  m b @ 1/: if 
the entire word had been passed to the letter-to- 
sound rules, the incorrect pronunciation /p r 
i? m b @ 1/would have resulted. In addition 
to affixes, known root morphemes could also be 
stripped to leave the remaining unknown mate- 
rial. For example, without morphological nal- 
ysis, penthouse may be wrongly pronounced as 
/p e n th au s/ ,  with a voiceless dental frica- 
tive. 
It is known that letter-to-sound rules are 
more accurate if they are not allowed to apply 
across morpheme boundaries (see \[1, Ch. 6\]), 
and this method takes advantage of that fact. 
Thus greater accuracy is obtained, for polymor- 
phemic unknown words, if known morphs can 
be stripped before the application of letter-to- 
sound rules. It is this task that the work de- 
scribed below attempts to carry out. 
The Alvey Natural Language Tools Mor- 
phological System (\[5\],\[6\]), already provides a 
comprehensive morphological nalyser system. 
This system allows morphological nalysis of 
words into morphemes based on user-defined 
rules. The basic system does not offer analysis 
of words containing unknown morphemes, nor 
does it provide a rank ordering of the output 
analyses. Both these latter features have been 
added in the work described below. 
The system consists of a two tier process: 
first a morphological nalysis, based on Kosken- 
niemi's two-level morphology (\[3\]); secondly the 
statement of morphosyntactic constraints (not 
available in Koskenniemi's system) based on a 
GPSG-like feature grammar. 
The morphographemic rules are specified as 
a set of high level rules (rather than directly 
as finite state transducers) which describe the 
relationship between a surface tape (the word) 
and a lexical tape (the normallsed lexical form). 
These rules specify contexts for pairs of lexical 
and surface characters. For example a rule 
+:e  <==> 
{ < s :s  h:h > s :s  x:x z:z y : i  } 
- - -  S :a  
specifies that a surface character e must match 
with a lexical character + when preceded by one 
of sh, s, x, z or the pair y:i (as in skies to 
sky+s), and succeeded by s. The "---~ denotes 
where the rule pair fits into the context. For ex- 
ample the above rule would admit the following 
match 
lexicaltape: b o x + s 
surface tape: b o x e s 
The exact syntax and interpretation is more 
fully described in \[5, Sect. 3\] and \[6, Ch. 2\]. 
In addition to segmentation each lexical en- 
try is associated with a syntactic ategory (rep- 
resented as a feature structure}. Grammar rules 
can be written to specify which conjunctions of
morphemes are valid. Thus valid analyses re- 
quire a valid segmentation a d a valid morpho- 
syntax. In the larger descriptions developed 
in the system a "categorial grammar"-like ap- 
proach has been used in the specification of af- 
fixes. An affix itself will specify what category 
it can attach ("apply") to and what its resulting 
category will be. 
In the work described here, the basic mor- 
phology system has been modified to analyse 
words containing morphemes that are not in the 
lexicon. The analysis method offers segmenta- 
tion and morphological nalysis (based on the 
word grammar),' which results in a list of pos- 
sible analyses. An ordering on these possible 
analyses has been defined, giving a most likely 
analysis, for which the spelling of the unknown 
morpheme can then be reconstructed using the 
system's original morphographemic rules. Fi- 
nally, the pronunciation of the unknown mor- 
pheme can be assigned, using letter-to-sound 
rules encoded as two-level rules. 
Analysis Method 
The method used to analyse words containing 
unknown substrings proceeds as follows. First, 
four new morphemes are added to the lexicon, 
one for each major morphologically productive 
- 1 (12-  
category (noun, verb, adjective and adverb). 
Each has a citation form of **. The intention 
is that the unknown part of a word will match 
these entries. Thus we get two-level segmenta- 
tion as follows 
lexicaltape: * 0 0 0 * + i n g + s 
surface tape: 0 p a r O O i n g 0 s 
The special character 0 represents the null sym- 
bol (i.e. the surface form would be par ings  - 
without the nulls). This matching is achieved 
by adding two two-level morphological rules. 
The first rule allows any character in the sur- 
face alphabet o match null on the lexical tape, 
but only in the context where the lexical nulls 
are flanked by lexicai asterisks matching with 
surface nulls. 
The second rule deals with constraining the 
? :0 pairs themselves. It deals with two spe- 
cific points. First, it ensures that there is only 
one occurrence of ** in an analysis (i.e only one 
unknown section). Second, it constrains the 
unknown section. This is done in two ways. 
Rather than simply allowing the unknown part 
to be any arbitrary collection of letters, it is re- 
stricted to ensure that if it starts with any of {h 
j 1 m n q r v x y z}, then it is also followed 
by a vowel. This (rightly) excludes the possibil- 
ity of an unknown section starting with an un- 
pronounceable consonant cluster e.g. computer  
could not be analysed as co-  input +er). Sec- 
ond, it ensures that the unknown section is at 
least two characters long and contains a vowel. 
This excludes the analysis of resting as re- 
st +ing. 
These restrictions on the unknown section 
are weak and more comprehensive r strictions 
would help. They are attempts at characteris- 
ing English morphemes in terms of the minimal 
English syllable. A more complex characteriza- 
tion, defining valid consonant clusters, vowels, 
etc. would be possible in this formalism, and 
the phonotactic onstraints of English syllables 
are well known. However, the resulting rules 
would be clumsy and slow, and it was felt that, 
at this stage, any small gain in accuracy would 
be offset by a speed penalty. 
The rules make  use of sets of characters. 
Anything is a set consisting of all surface char- 
acters, BCDFGKPSTW and HJLMNqRVXYZ are sets 
consisting of those letters, V is the set of vowels 
and C the consonants. The character $ is used 
to mark word boundaries. 
O:Anything <ffi> 
{ *:0 < *:0 (O:Anything) l+ > } 
{ *:0 < (O:Anything) l+ *:0 > } 
* :0  <"> 
{ 0:$ < 0:$ (=:=)1+ > ) - - -  
{ < { O:BCDFCKPSTW O:V 
O: Anything > 
< O:HJLMNQRVXYZ O:V > } 
or  { < O:O (O :V) l+  > 
< 0:V (0:C)1+ > } - - -  
{ < (=:=)1+ 0:$ > 0 :$ )  
The above rules are somewhat clumsily formu- 
lated. This is partly due to the particular imple- 
mentation used, which allows only one rule for 
each surface:lexical pair I and partly due to the 
complexity of the phenomena being described. 
Word Grammar  
Using the above two rules and adding the four 
new lexical entries to a larger description, it is 
now possible to segment words with one un- 
known substring. Because the system encodes 
constraints for affixes via feature specifications, 
only morphosyntactically valid analyses will be 
permitte d. That  is, although ** is ambiguous 
in its category, if it is followed by +ed only the 
analysis involving the verb will succeed. For ex- 
ample, although the segmentation process could 
segment b ipeds  --* ** +ed +s the word gram- 
mar section would exclude this analysis, since 
the +s suffix only follows uninflected verbs or 
nouns .  
However, there are a number of possible mis- 
takes that can occur. When an unknown sec- 
tion exists it may spuriously contain other mor- 
phemes, leading to an incorrect analysis. For 
example 
CO'IotLY -> CO-  ** 
readab le  -> re -  **  +ab le  
car toons  -> car  ** +s (compound noun) 
In actual fact, when words are analysed by this 
technique a large number of analyses is usually 
found. The reasons for the large number are 
as follows. Firstly, the assumed size of the un- 
known part can vary for the same word, as in 
the following: 
tRitchie (\[4\]) shows that this is not a restriction on 
the formal power of the rules. 
l ( )3 - 
ent i t led  -> ** 
ent i t led  -> ** +ed 
ent i t led  -> en-  ** +ed 
ent i t led  -> en-  ** 
Secondly, because ** is four ways ambiguous, 
there can be multiple analyses for the same sur- 
face form. For example, a word ending in s 
could be either a plural noun or a third person 
singular verb. 
These points can multiply together and of- 
ten produce a large number of possible analyses. 
Out  of the test set of 200 words, based on a lex- 
icon consisting of around 3500 morphemes (in- 
cluding the ** entries), the average number of 
analyses found was 9, with a max imum number 
of 71 (for funct iona l ) .  
Choos ing  an  Ana lys i s  
In order to use these results in a text-to-speech 
system, it is necessary to choose one possible 
analysis, since a TTS system is deterministic. 
To do this, the analyses are rank ordered. A 
number of factors are exploited in the rank or- 
dering: 
- length of unknown root 
- structural ordering rules (\[1, Ch. 3\]) 
- frequency of affix 
Each of these factors will be described in turn. 
When analysing a word containing an unknown 
part, the best results are usually obtained by us- 
ing the analysis with the shortest unknown part 
(see \[1, Oh. 6 D. Thus the analysis of walkers  
would be ordered as follows (most likely first): 
** +er  +s  > **  +s > ** 
This heuristk will occasionally fail, as in beers  
where the shortest unknown analysis is ** +er 
+s. But the correct result will be obtained in 
most cases. 
The second ordering constraint is based on 
the ordering rules used in \[1\]. Some words can 
be segmented in many different ways (this is 
true even if all parts are known). For example 
scarcity -> scar city 
scarc i ty -> scarce +ity 
scarc i ty  -> scar  c i te  +y 
A simple rule notation has been defined for as- 
signing order to analyses in terms of their mor- 
phological parse tree. These rules can be sum- 
marised as 
prefixing > suffixing > 
inflection > compounding 
The third method used for ordering is affix fre- 
quency. The frequencies are based on suffix-as- 
tag (word class) frequencies in the LOB corpus 
of written English, given in \[2\]. Thus the suffix 
+er forming a noun from a verb (as in walker) 
was marked in the lexicon as being more likely 
than the adjectival comparative +er. 
These constraints are applied simultane- 
ously. Each rule has an appropriate weight- 
ing, such that the length of the unknown part 
is a more significant factor than morphological 
structure, which in: turn is more significant han 
affix frequency. 
Resu l ts  
The method was subjected to a test procedure. 
The test used a basic lexicon of around 3500 
morphemes, of which around 150 were affixes. 
From a randomly selected AI magazine arti- 
cle, the first 200 words were used which could 
not be analysed by the basic morphological sys- 
tem (i.e. without the unknown root section). 
When these 200 words were analysed using the 
method described in the previous sections, 133 
words (67~) were analysed correctly, 48 words 
(24~) were wrong due to segmentation error, 
and 19 (9~) were wrong due to word class er- 
ror. An analysis was deemed to be correct when 
the most preferred analysis had both the correct 
morphological structure and the correct word 
class. 
Segmentation errors were due mainly to spu- 
rious words in sub-parts of unknown sections, 
e.g. i l l us t ra te  ~ i l l  ** ate.  Such errors 
will increase as the lexicon grows. To prevent 
this type of error,: it may be necessary to place 
restrictions on compounding, such that those 
words which can form part  of compounds should 
be marked as such (though this is a major re- 
search problem in itself). Word class errors 
occurred where the correct segmentation was 
found but an incorrect morphological structure 
was assigned. 
The definition of error used here may be 
over-restrictive, as it may still be the case that 
erroneous segmentation and structure errors 
still provide analyses with the correct pronun- 
ciation. But at this t ime the remainder of the 
text-to-speech system is not advanced enough 
for this to be adequately tested.

Generating the Spelling of 
Unknown Morphemes 
A method has been described for handling a 
word which cannot be analysed by the con- 
ventional morphological nalysis process. This 
method may generate a number of analyses, so 
an ordering of the results is defined. However, 
in a text-to-speech system (or even an interac- 
tive spelling corrector), it may be desirable to 
add the unknown root to a user lexicon for fu- 
ture reference. In such a case, it will be nec- 
essary to reconstruct the underlying spelling of 
the unknown morpheme. 
This can be done in a very similar I way to 
that in which the system normally generates 
surface forms from hxical forms. The problem 
is the following: given a surface form and a set 
of spelling rules (not including the two special 
rules described above), define the set of possi- 
ble lexical forms which can match to the surface 
form. This, of course, would over-generate lex- 
ical forms, but if the permitted lexical form is 
further constrained so as to match the one given 
from the analysis containing the ** a more sat- 
isfactory result will be obtained. 
For example, the surface form remoned 
would be analysed as ~e-**+ed. A matching is 
carried out character by character between the 
lexical and surface forms, checking each match 
with respect o the spelling rules (and hypothe- 
sizing nulls where appropriate). On encounter- 
ing the ** section of the lexical form, the pro- 
cess attempts to match all possible lexical char- 
acters with the surface form.. This is of course 
still constrained by the spelling rules, so only a 
few characters will match. What is significant 
is that the minor orthographic changes that the 
spelling rules describe will be respected. Thus 
in this case the ** matches mone (rather than 
simply mon without an e), as the spelling rules 
require there to be an ? inserted before the +ed 
in this case. 
Similarly, given the surface string mogged, 
analysed as **+ed, the root form mog is gener- 
ated. However, the alternative forms mogg and 
mogge are also generated. This is not incorrect, 
as in similar cases uch analyses are correct (eg. 
egged and s i lhouet ted  respectively). As yet, 
the method has no means of selecting between 
these possibilities. 
After the generation of possible ortho- 
graphic forms, the letter-to-sound rules are ap- 
plied. As regards the format of these rules, what 
is required is something very similar to Kosken- 
niemi two-level rules, relating graphemes to 
phonemes in particular contexts. A small set of 
grapheme to phoneme rules was written using 
this notation. However, there were problems in 
writing these rules, as the fuller set of rules from 
which they were taken used the concept of rule 
ordering, while the Koskenniemi rule interpre- 
tation interprets all rules in parallel. The re- 
sult was that the rewritten rules were more dif- 
ficult both to read and to write. Although it is 
possible (and even desirable) to use finite state 
transducers in the run-time system, the current 
Koskenniemi format may not be the best format 
for letter-to-sound rules. Some other notation 
which could compile to the same form would 
make it easier to extend the ruleset. 
Problems 
The technique described above largely depends 
on the existence of an appropriate l xicon and 
morphological nalyser. The starting-point was 
a fairly large lexicon (over 3000 morphemes) 
and an analyser description, and the expecta- 
tion was that only minor additions would be 
needed to the system. However, it seems that 
significantly better esults will require more sig- 
nificant changes. 
Firstly, as the description used had a rich 
morpho-syntax, words could be analysed in 
many ways giving different syntactic markings 
(eg. different number and person markings for 
verbs) which were not relevant for the rest of 
the system. Changes were made to reduce the 
number of phonetically similar (though syntac- 
tically different) analyses. The end result now 
states only the major category of the analysis. 
(Naturally, if the~ system were to be used within 
a more complex syntactic parser, the other anal- 
yses may be needed). 
Secondly, the number of ~s~em ~ entries in 
the lexicon is significant. It must be large 
enough to analyse most words, though not so 
large that it gives too many erroneous anal- 
yses of unknown words. ALso, while it has 
been assumed that the lexicon contains produc- 
tive affixes, perhaps it should also contain cer- 
tain derivational ffixes which are not normally 
productive, such as te le - ,  +olosy, +phobia, 
+vorous. These would be very useful when 
analysing unknown words. The implication is 
that there should be a special exicon used for 
- 105-  
analysing unknown words. This lexicon would 
have a large number of affixes, together with 
constraints on compounds, that would not nor- 
mally be used when analysing words. 
Another problem is that unknown words 
are often place-names, proper names, Ioanwords 
etc. The technique described here would prob- 
ably not deal adequately with such words. 
So far, this technique has been described 
0nly in terms of English. When considering 
other languages, especially those where com- 
pounding is common (eg. Dutch and German), 
the method would be even more advantageous. 
In novel compounds, large sections of the word 
could still be analysed. In the above descrip- 
tion, only one unknown part is allowed in each 
word. This seems to be reasonable for En- 
glish, where there will rarely be compounds of 
the form ** +aug ** +our. However, in other 
languages (especially those with a more fully- 
developed system of inflection) such structures 
do exist. An example is the Dutch word be- 
jaardentehuizen (old peoples homes), which has 
the structure noun +on noun +en. Thus it is 
possible for words to contain two (or more) 
non-contiguous nknown sections. The method 
described here could probably cope with such 
cases in principle, but the current implemen- 
tation does not do so. Instead, it would find 
one unknown part from the start of the first 
unknown morpheme to the end of the final un- 
known morpheme. 
Summary 
A system has been described which will analyse 
any word and assign a pronunciation. The sys- 
tem first tries to analyse an input word using 
the standard analysis procedure. If this fails, 
the modified lexicon and spelling rule set are 
used. The output analyses are then ordered. 
For each unknown section, the underlying or- 
thographic form is constructed, and letter-to- 
sound rules are applied. The end result is a 
string of phonemic forms, one form for each 
morpheme in the original word. These phone- 
mic forms are then processed by morphophono- 
logical rules, followed by rules for word stress 
assignment and vowel reduction.
