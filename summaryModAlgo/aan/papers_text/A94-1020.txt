Abst ract  
An analysis of the evolution of Natu- 
ral Language front ends in the last three 
decades shows that the growth in portabil- 
ity brought, as a side effect, the narrow- 
ing of the provided coverage of contextu- 
ally based linguistic phenomena, such as 
anaphora nd ellipsis. 
This paper presents the design and state 
of development of a computational mecha- 
nism which provides pronominal Anaphora 
Resolution within the environment of a 
highly portable Natural Language front 
end to databases, SQUIRREL3 Simple 
cases of Ellipsis are also treated by the pro- 
posed model. 
An Overview of SQUIRREL is presented, 
followed by a description of the Discourse 
Module and the results achieved so far. The 
prototype is implemented in C-Prolog. 
1 I n t roduct ion  
The development of Natural Language (NL) systems 
for data retrieval has been a central issue in NL Pro- 
cessing research for the last three decades, motivated 
by the aim of helping non-expert database users. 
When we try to draw a line of evolution of such 
systems, it can be observed that growth in portabil- 
ity, essential for commercial viability, came at a cost 
in terms of broader linguistic overage. 2 
Earlier systems, mostly research motivated, were 
mainly developed for a single application, using 
domain-dependent information for treating contex- 
tual phenomena (eg, DEACON (Craig et al, 1966), 
SHRDLU (Winograd, 1972), LUNAR (Woods, 
1The current system forms the base line for a joint 
SERC/DTI funded collaborative project between the 
University of Essex and Status IQ Ltd. for construct- 
ing an integrated platform for the retrieval of structured 
and textual data through Natural Language queries.

review on Portable NL front ends. 
1973), LADDER (Hendrix et al, 1978)). In con- 
trast, the subsequent generation of interfaces car- 
ried a higher emphasis on portability in their de- 
sign (eg, INTELLECT (Harris, 1984), IRUS (Bates 
et al, 1986), TEAM (Grosz et al, 1987)). These 
systems, however, offer a reduced coverage of dis- 
course phenomena,  central issue when continuity 
in the database consultation carries some priority. 
Thus, the ideal NL Front End (NLFE) should carry 
a broader linguistic overage, in order to support a 
user focused query process, combined with a high 
degree of portability. 
In this light, we designed a Discourse Module, 
which is incorporated into a highly portable NLFE, 
SQUIRREL (DeRoeck et al, 1991). The system was 
originally conceived with a single-query based mode 
of consultation. By providing for anaphora nd sim- 
ple cases of ellipsis resolution, the Discourse Mod- 
ule yields continuous consultations without the use 
of world models (to maintain the system's general 
portability). 
2 Issues in Anaphora Resolution 
Our primary goal is the achievement of dialogue-like 
querying by extending SQUIRREL to a system ca- 
pable of dealing with basic pronominal naphora and 
ellipsis. Information about each query is made avail- 
able to the following queries, such that references to 
entities already introduced can be resolved. 
This solution is common practice among NLFEs 
implementations (eg, LDC-1 (Ballard el al., 1984), 
Datenbank-DIALOG (Trost el al., 1988)). However, 
it is subject o limitations. In particular, sequences 
like the following cannot be handled: 
Query: who works for which salary in shoes? 
DB answer: \[malcolm- $5,000.00\] 
Query: who is his boss? 
because the resulting query 
Query: who is the boss of \[who works for which 
salary in shoes\] ?
leads the system into a type error, as a personal 
pronoun was substituted by a sentence. This was our

main motivation for keeping information conveyed 
by the DB answer, so it could be used for future 
reference. We consider this essential for achieving a
dialogue-like mode of consultation. 
3 Overv iew o f  SQUIRREL  
The system consists of a portable Natural Lan- 
guage front end prototype for the interrogation of 
logical and relational database systems (DeRoeck et 
al., 1991). It is divided into two main sections: the 
Front End and the Back End \[Fig. 1\]. 
The Front End takes the input sentence, produc- 
ing syntactic and semantic representations, which it 
maps into First Order Logic. All representations 
are independent of the domain of application or 
database model. Syntactic and semantic rules work 
in tandem. The former are a feature-based CFG, 
whereas the latter are expressed in Property Theory 
(Turner, 1987). The lexicon is incomplete, treating 
unknown words as proper nouns to be fully inter- 
preted when reaching the database. 
The Back End uses an Extended Data Model to 
map the logical representation i to expressions in 
the Domain Relational Calculus (DRC), which is 
translated via Tuple Relational Calculus (TRC) into 
SQL (a standard query language) by means of a syn- 
tactic transducer. All representations at this level 
are domain dependent. 
Both the Front End and Back End were designed 
to guarantee modularity and portability to the sys- 
tem as a whole. Strict separation between domain 
dependent and independent components must be 
maintained for the sake of portability. The system 
has no world model embedded in it, and no infer- 
ence engine. Only the lexicon and the table-based 
Extended Data Model have to be customised for a 
new domain of application. 
SQUIRREL maintains three levels of ambiguity, 
induced by the syntax, the semantics, and the do- 
main. The Back End has a type checker, which uses 
the Extended Data Model to resolve ambiguity from 
the semantic level. At each level, all possible repre- 
sentations are generated by the system, and tried 
one at a time. Only the appropriate ones survive 
the type checking and the database consultation. 
As a consequence, more than one successful an- 
swer can be obtained from the same query. All suc- 
cessful answers are presented to the user, who is in 
charge of choosing one. This feature was added to 
the original system in order to give the user control 
over which elements are added to the context during 
the consultation. 
4 The  D iscourse  Modu le  - Overv iew 
The core of the Discourse Module is the context, a 
dynamic list of candidate antecedents for anaphoric 
reference. The context grows as a stack, i.e., can- 
didates selected from each query and its DB answer 
are stored on top of the candidates from the previous 
queries as the consultation evolves. All candidates 
are represented in the same format. 
Selection of candidates from the query is regulated 
by rules embedded in the system's grammar, where 
each syntactic rule has its associated context rule. 
Entries are associated with information pertaining 
to category, number, gender and semantic represen- 
tation. Since the lexicon allows open classes (such as 
proper names, for which no specific lexical entry ex- 
ists), some of this information may not become avail- 
able until the query reaches the database. At this 
point, a separate database interrogation will supply 
gender information for proper nouns in the context. 
Selecting which items in database answers are 
added to the context is less straightforward, as no 
syntactic or semantic information is available con- 
cerning a particular answer. Furthermore, the selec- 
tion may depend on a specific application and should 
be a factor for customisation. As a consequence, in- 
formation on which entities are to be kept as candi- 
dates for reference in the context is encoded in the 
120 
Extended Data Model. Entries are formatted and 
associated with syntactic and semantic information 
(on the basis of the characteristics of the database 
domain from which they are retrieved) and, in cases 
where the data derives from domains associated with 
proper nouns, gender is retrieved immediately. 
This context grows dynamically and is passed from 
query to query. Nevertheless, this structure does 
not grow indefinitely during the consultation (the 
context updating mechanism is presented in ?5.2). 
When an anaphor is encountered in a query, a 
candidate is chosen among the available possible an- 
tecedents, and its semantics i inserted in the query's 
semantic representation, which is then passed to the 
back end in the normal way. The binding mechanism 
is presented in ?5.3. 
Clearly, much hinges on an effective process to de- 
termine appropriate antecedents. In the context of 
this application, which strongly emphasizes portabil- 
ity and, hence, seeks to avoid incorporating eneral 
world knowledge, this issue is subject o constraints. 
5 The Context  
5.1 Rat iona le  
In resolving anaphoric reference in NLFEs to 
databases, due respect must be given to user require- 
ments; it must remain clear at all times which query 
has been answered. Findings in Anick et al (1991) 
also apply here. The operation of the front end must 
be clear to the user, who must retain the ability to 
affect the system's decisions. As a consequence, we 
adopt a protocol whereby (i) the user can always 
reject the bindings offered by the system, and (ii) 
choice between competing candidates i in the hands 
of the user. 
This scenario has some consequences. First of 
all, our strategy aims not to completely resolve an 
anaphoric reference at all costs, but to present he 
user with alternatives selected on the basis of reliable 
system information. Secondly, to make this process 
helpful, in a manageable way, the choice of candi- 
dates must be focused, intuitively credible, and of 
limited size. 
5.2 Context  S t ructur ing  
Helpful selection of candidate antecedents presup- 
poses a sensitivity to the structure of the current 
discourse. More is needed than a simple collection 
of items based on compliance with syntactic con- 
straints. The literature offers a collection of ap- 
proaches to modelling discourse structure. 
Some views concentrate on deriving coherence re- 
lations between discourse segments, with the help of 
world models (Hobbs, 1979; Reichman, 1984). Work 
on Discourse Structure Theory (Grosz, 1977; Grosz 
and Sidner, 1986) searches for automatic ways of seg- 
menting discourse based on intentions and purposes 
embedded in discourse segments. 
Most of the results available are not readily adapt- 
able to the current type of application. No world 
model can be introduced without severe conse- 
quences for portability. Segmentation i formation 
is not available and cannot be realised in advance 
since consultation is on-line. 
The lack of clues regarding how to segment he 
dialogue between user and interface, and how to 
identify the relationships between such segments re- 
stricts the possible solutions. Nonetheless, some 
domain information is present in the Data Model 
and can be exploited. The segmentation process 
deployed here relies on two potential sources for 
identifying coherence in relational queries. First of 
all, 'meaningful' queries are always associated with 
a complete access path covering relations and at- 
tributes in the database: if we represent the data 
model as a graph, a meaningful query will always 
cover a connected subgraph. This gives us a mea- 
sure of cohesion within a single query. 
Building on this, we can develop a notion of dis- 
course domain covered by successive queries by com- 
paring the access paths involved in them. To use the 
graphical analogy as above, a collection of queries 
covers a discourse domain if their graphs intersect. 
Finally, the degree and area of intersection (con- 
sulted attributes) may offer information which can 
be used in the identification of focus. 
Candidates for anaphoric reference are grouped 
in segments, each containing all successive queries 
which share part of an access path. The first query 
starts the first segment of the context. When a 
new query is entered, its covered omain is matched 
against that of the segment on top of the context. 
If the intersection is not empty, candidates from the 
query are added to this segment. In case the in- 
tersection is empty, the system identifies a change 
of focus on the consultation, and a new segment is 
started. In order to allow the user to return to the 
previous topic after the change of focus occurred, a 
number of segments are held in the context. This 
number can vary from application to application, 
and the current limit is set to three. 
Following Grosz and Sidner (1986), segments oc- 
cur in sequence, or are embedded, to allow users 
to elaborate on a change of focus before returning 
to the previous topic. In case the current segment 
intersects with the second most recent one on the 
context list (if any), this can be seen as a return 
to the previous topic (segments 1 and 3 in Fig 2). 
The current segment will continue to grow indepen- 
dently, but the candidates in the second most recent 
segment will become available for reference. 
Within a segment, candidates are grouped by 
query number. When a candidate re-occurs, it is 
placed on the top of the context list, and its previ- 
ous occurrence is deleted, regardless what segment 
it belongs to. The antecedent of a resolved anaphor 
is also added to the top \[Fig. 2\]. This strategy al- 
121 
lows for the representation f a notion of 'distance' 
between candidate antecedents and anaphor. 
5.3 The  Bind ing  Mechan ism 
When an anaphoric expression is encountered, all 
candidates in the current segment with appropriate 
syntactic characteristics are selected and placed in 
the loci list (Sidner, 1983). This list is presented to 
the user, who must select a candidate or reject all 
options (in case there is more than one) \[Fig. 3\]. 
Once a candidate is selected, its semantic repre- 
sentation is spliced into the First Order Logic rep- 
resentation of the current query, and the normal 
querying process is resumed. 
5.4 Examples  
Example  1: Context updating mechanism \[Fig. 2\] 
query:  who is edna's boss? 
db answer: \[malcolm\] 
query: who supplies hoes? 
db answer : \[peterSJCO\] 
query:  what is sylvia's salary? 
db answer: \[2500\] 
query:  who is her boss? 
** USER:  P lease  choose  one  subst i tu te  fo r  
the  pronoun 'her'  : 
I - sy lv ia  
2 - none  above  number :  1 
db  answer: \[edna\] 
query:  what is kate's address? 
db answer: \[spring ave/ 
query:  what is her account? 
** USER: P lease  choose  one  substitute for 
the pronoun 'her' : 
1 - kate  
2 - none  above  number :  1 
db  answer: \[678.655\] 
Candidates are grouped by query number and seg- 
ment number. In the fourth query above, only sylvia 
is presented as a substitute for the anaphor her, since 
this is the only entry with appropriate syntactic fea- 
tures in the current segment (segment 3 - Fig. 2). 
In case the user rejects it, edna (second most recent 
segment) will be presented as a second option. Sim- 
ilarly, in the last query, only kate is presented as an 
initial choice (current segment). 
Example  2: 
query: who 
db answer: 
query: who 
db answer: 
The binding mechanism \[Fig. 3\] 
is edna's boss? 
\[malcolm\] " 
is sylvia's boss ? 
\[edn4 
query: who works for her  ? 
** USER: P lease  choose  one substitute for 
the  pronoun Cher' : 
I - sy lv ia  
2 - edna  
3 - none  above  number :  
db  answer: \[mary, sylvia, ted\] 
The binding mechanism relies solely on informa- 
tion provided by the Data Model, since there is no 
world model available. The absence of such a knowl- 
edge base is justified by the preoccupation with 
portability. However, the task of dealing with dis- 
course phenomena is made more difficult. 
The user is given the burden of establishing pri- 
ority when chosing candidates for anaphora. In Ex- 
ample  2, for instance, the system has no means of 
disambiguating between the two possible candidates 
for binding the pronoun 'her' (sylvia, edna), since 
both have the same properties. Note that humans 
would not be able to select one either. 
Care must be taken in using information about 
candidates to resolve ambiguity (for instance, the 
fact that edna is a boss, whereas ylvia is not), since 
this could lead into erroneous interpretations. The 
person edna can be used in different contexts within 
the same dialogue, although it was introduced in the 
context via a query where she appears as boss. Imag- 
ine that she is a boss in a shop, but also a registered 
customer. In such case, references to her name as a 
customer would be disregarded. 
6 P lu ra l s  
The importance of a proper context updating mech- 
anism is better seen when we focus on the treatment 
of plurals. Currently, the system is being extended 
to cope with plural nouns and groups, referred to 
by pronouns like they, them, their. The incorpora- 
tion in the context of these elements appearing in 
the query or DB answer is processed as follows: 
(a) p lu ra l  nouns  appearing in the query or DB 
answer are kept as plural elements, having one entry 
in the context; 
(b) g roups  resulting from a DB answer have each 
of their elements incorporated in isolation, as a sin- 
gular noun, as well as one entry with all elements 
combined as a group element; 
(e) con junct ions  appearing in the query are 
treated as in (b). 
In the present system, problems mostly concern 
the identification of which elements, appearing in 
separate queries or in a query/DB answer, should 
be gathered together to constitute a group entry. 
When a plural anaphor is encountered, the context 
is searched. In case there are no plural/group candi- 
dates available, or the user rejects them all, elements 
in the current discourse segment will be gathered to- 
gether and presented to the user as a group.

7 Conc lus ions  
We presented here a module for anaphora resolution 
in a highly portable NLFE - SQUIRREL, which al- 
lows for continuous consultations whilst maintaining 
the system's portability. 
A mechanism to deal with possible alternative suc- 
cessful DB answers has also been added. Such fea- 
tures did not constitute a problem for the original 
system, since no information was passed forward. 
With the incorporation of answers into the context, 
it became necessary to allow users to choose among 
the multiple possibilities presented by the system, 
assuring that a unique answer is selected. 
We treat some simple cases of there (although it 
is not an anaphor, but a deictic adverb), due to the 
high rate of usage of such pointing back device in 
dialogues. In the domain covered by this implemen- 
tation, its use allows reference to addresses and lo- 
cations like department and floor. 
We maintain that portability is an important 
property, as NLFEs to databases only make sense 
in a commercial context. We have demonstrated 
that it is possible to include reliable, user-oriented 
features of discourse phenomena in the coverage of 
modular NLFEs without recourse to world models, 
safeguarding portability.
