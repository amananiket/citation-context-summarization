This paper snggests a method to align 
Korean-English parallel corpus. '1?he 
structural dissimilarity between Korean 
and Indo-European languages requires 
more flexible measures to evaluate the 
alignment candidates between the bilin- 
gual units than is used to handle the 
pairs of Indo-European languages. The 
flexible measure is intended to capture 
the dependency between bilingual items 
that can occur in different units accord- 
ing to different ordering rules. The pro- 
posed method to accomplish Korean- 
English aligmnent akes phrases as an 
alignment unit that is a departure from 
the existing methods taking words as 
the unit. Phrasal alignment avoids the 
problem of alignment units and appease 
the problem of ordering mismatch. The 
parameters are estimated using the EM 
algorithm. The proposed alignment al- 
gorithm is based on dynamic program- 
ming. In the experimenl, s carried out 
on 253,000 English words and its Ko- 
rean translations the proposed method 
achived 68.7% in accuracy at phrase 
level and 89.2% in accuracy with the 
bilingual dictionary induced from the 
alignment. 'File result of the align- 
ment may lead to richer bilingual data 
than can be derived from only word- 
level aligments. 
1 Introduction 
Studies on parallel corpus consisting of multilin- 
gum texts are often guided with the purpose to 
obtain linguistic resources uch as bilingual dic- 
tionary, bilingual grammars (Wu 1995) and trans- 
lation examples. Parallel texts have t)roved to be 
useful not only in tile development of statistical

in other applications uch as word sense disana- 
biguation (Brown et al 1991) and bilingnal lex- 
icography (Klavans and Tzoukermann 1990). As 
the parallel corpora become more and more ac- 
cessible, many researches based on the bilingual 
corpora are now encouraged that were once con- 
sidered impractical. 
Alignment as a study of parallel corpus refers 
to the process of establishing the correspondences 
between matching elements in parallel corpus. 
Alignment methods tend to approach the problem 
differently according to the alignment units the 
methods adopt. Of various alignment options, the 
alignlnent of word units is to compute a sequence 
of the matching pairs of words in a parallel corpus. 
Figure 1 show the aligned results of a paral- 
lel corpus that was originally paired in a sentence 
level. In figure 1, the right-hand side of pair-wise 
aligmnent is the corresponding Korean words. De- 
scribed in the parentheses on the right of each Ko- 
rean word are corresponding English meaning and 
syntactic functions of the word. 
The existing methods for the alignment of Indo- 
European language pairs such as English and 
French take words as aligning units and restrict 
the correspondences between words to be one 
of the functional mappings (one-to-one, one-to-

of structural information such word or(ler and to 
handle the difli~reu('e of aligimwnt units. 
An early ~ttemt)t o align Asian and \[ndo- 
l!;uropean l~mguage pairs is found from tim work 
by Wu and Xia (199d). Their result is promising 
with the demor, stration of high accuracy o\[' learn- 
ing 1)ilingual exicon between English aml (;hin(',se 
for fl:equently use(1 words without t;he considera- 
tion of word order. The C, hinesc-t';nglish align- 
meat consists of segmentation of an inl)U/, (',hinese 
sentence, and aligning the segmented seltteiic(? with 
the c~mdidate English SelltellCe. The g(eneration of 
segments to be aligne(l is an additional prol)h~m to 
the decision of aligning units before 1he aligmnent 
takes l)b~ce. Wu and Xia (1!)94) used I)ilingual dic- 
tionary to segment he sentence, but the selectioii 
of segment can(lid~ttes i hard to make with rdi- 
able accuracy. 'l'he bilingual dictionari(,s are not 
always awfilabh', and take. considered)h; resources 
to build. 
'\['he method we suggest integrates the l)roce- 
dures to solve the two critical /)robh~ms: deci(l 
ing aligning units and aligning tim candidates of 
dilferent word orders and accoml)lishes the atigu 
meat wi|,hout using any dictionary. 
The proposed alignment nmthod assumes it l)re -
l)roc(,.ssing step t)efore iterative applications of 
~fligmnent ste 1) as is illustrated in tigure 2. Part- 
of-sl)eech tagging is don(; I)elbre the actual align 
meat so that the. word-phrases (a spacing unit in 
Korean) may be decomposed into prop('.r words 
attd functional morphemes and the Korean and 
I:mglish words may be assigned with apl)ropriate 
tags. 
'l'he proposed alignment is done first \['or l)hras(~ 
pairs and then word pairs that eventually induces 
the bilingual dictionary. The alignment nlethod 
is realized through ~he rcestimation of its proba- 
l)ilistic parameters from tim aligne.d sem,cn('es. In

To detine p(f\]e), the 1)robability of the French sen 
tence f given the l",nglish sentence , Brown et

each word in e acts independently to produce the 
words in f. When a typical alignm('at is denoted

Given an aligmnent a between e and f, Brown

p(f,al('. ) as the product of the following thre.c

be aligned, for an English sentence consists o\[' 
words whereas a t,\[oreatt sentence consists of word- 
l>hrases (compound words). Typically a word- 
phrase is (:otnl)osed of one or more content words 
and postpositional function words. 
A Korean word is usually a smaller unit than an 
English word and a word-phrase is larger than an 
English word. For this reason the exact thatch as 
in English-French pair is hard to establish for the 
case of Koean-English (Shin et al 1995). Con- 
sequently word-to-word or word-to-word-phrase 
alignment )etwcen Korean and l';nglish will suf'+ 
fee from trait mistnatch attd low accuracy. The 
complication of unit mismatch often implies the 
need of non-flmctional aligntnent such as many- 
to-many mapping. Non-flmctiomd mapping tnay 
also occur in the l!htglish-French case, but with 
much less frequency. 
'l'he table 1 shows the degree of mismatch be- 
tween English words and Korean words that are 
analyzed by our atttomatic POS tagger and tnor- 
phological analyzer. When we checked randomly 
selected 200 sentence pairs by hand, only aa.s% or 
all pairs have one+to-one correspondences between 
English words and Korean words. 
2.3 Korean  to Engl ish A l ignment  
In this section, we propose a Korean to English 
aligmnent method that aligns in both word and 
phrase lewds at the same t.ime. First, we introduce 
the method in word-to-word alignment, att(l then 
extend it to inchMe phrase-to-phrase alignment. 
By definition, a phrase in this paper refers to 
a linguistic unit of 1Tlore general structure than 
it is recognized in general from the terms, noun 
and adverb phrases. A phrase is any arbitrary 
sequence of ad, iaeent words in a sentence. 
2.3.1 Base Method  (using only  
word- to -word  cor respondences)  
In t;he developrnent of our method, we follow 
the basic idea of' statisticaL1 translation proposed 
by Brown et al (11993). '\['o every pair of sen- 
tences of e and k, we assign a value p(elk), the 
probability that a translator will pro(luce e as its 
translation of k, where e is a sequence of English 
words and k is a sequence of Korean words. 
p(e.lk) = ~ r,(g Iki) (3) 
j= l  i=0 
In equation 3, n and m are the nmnl)er of words 
in the English sentence  and its correspoudil G 
Korean sentence k respectively, cj and kl are tit{> 
aligtdng unit between l'2nglish sentence and Ko- 
rean sentence k. cj rq+resenl,s j-th word in I"nglish 
sentence and k/ represents i-th word in Korean 
sentence. For example, in Figure 1 English word 
"the" is ct and Korean word "ku" is kt. 
2.3.2 P roposed  Method  (Extended 
Method)  
The base method of word level aligtnncnt is ex- 
tend('d with 1)hrase-level alignntettt hat ow'x- 
comes the dHDrence of matching unit and provides 
more opportunity for the extraction of richer lit> 
guistic information such as l)hrasal-lewq bilingual 
dictionary. To cot)e with the data sparseness prob- 
lem caused by considering all possible phrases, we 
represent phrases by the tag sequences of their 
component words. 
If an English sentence and its Korean trans- 
lation k are partitioned into a sequence of' phrases 
p~. and t)~ of all possible sequences s(e, k), we can 
write p(elk) as in equation 5 where l)~ and Pk are 
phrase sequences and a(p+, t>~:) denotes all possible 
alignments between Pe and Pk.

If we represent he phra.se-to-phrase correspon- 
dences using the tag sequence of phrase and words 
composing phrase, The equatiou 5 can be rewrit- 
ten as in equation 6 letting phrase match be rep- 
resented by the tag sequence of phrases as well as 
words. \[n equation 6, k~ ~ is j-th phrase of \]d '~ , and 
l(kP~l , j e denotes the tag sequence of words compos- 
ing phrase kj'Pk. IP~\[ is the number of phrases in a

Although the al igmnent algorithm described 
above with the COml>texity of O( I , :2MN)  is sim- 
ple and c\[licicnt,, this algorit, hm has the limit, a- 
lion caused by the assumption of dynanfic pro- 
gramming.  The dynamic programming in the 
context of al ig|nnent assumes fltat th,+, previous 
233  
selections do not interfere with the fllture deci- 
sions. The alignment decision, however, may de- 
pend on the previous matches to the extent that 
the results from dynamic programming inay not 
be sufficiently accurate. One popular solution is 
to maintain upper t-best cases instead of just one 
as following where max-t denotes the t-th max 
candidate. 
= max-  t \[pi-a(t') + logp(k~,, c~b)\] 
l<t /<r , l< j<N

= arg max-  t \[~i_~(t') + logp(ki?,, ej, b)\] 
I<t t<T, I< j<N 
l<a~L, I<b<L 
As a result, the running complexity of the pro- 
posed algorithm becomes O(TL2MN).  Taking T 
and L as constants, the order of complexity be- 
comes O(MN).  
As another method to relax the problem of de- 
cision dependency on the previous matches, pre- 
emptive scheme to find max matching of phrase 
ki,~ is adopted. In the preemptive aligmnent, the 
previous election can be rematched with the bet- 
ter selection found by later decision. 
In following algorithm, ~(ki,a,n) denote ej,v 
which has n-th highest matching wdue with Ko- 
rean phrase ki,~ among all possible matching 
Korean phrase and u(ki,a,n) carry the weight 
tbr tile matching. ~i,b indicate matched Korean 
phrase with ej,b in current status and v~j,~ denote 
their matching weight. 'l'he established match- 
ing in previous stage can be changed when an- 
other matching, which has higer matching weight, 
is identified in this algorithm.

Although the proposed algorithm can not cover all

produces resonably accurate alignment results efli- 
ciently as is demonstrated in the following section. 
2.6 Exper i lnents  
The total training corpus tbr our experiments con- 
sists of 254,100 English words and 178,300 Korean 
word-phrases. The content of training corpus is 
summarized in table 2. 
A tIMM Part-of-Speech tagger is used to tag 
words beibre aligmnents. An accurate IIMM de- 
signed by the authors for Korean sentences taking 
into account the fact that a Korean sentence is 
a sequence of word-phrases i used (Shin et al 
95). The l)enn Treebank POS tagset that is com- 
posed of 48 tags and 52 Korean tagset is used in 
the tagging. The errors that is generated by mor- 
phological analysis and tagging cause many of the 
alignment errors. 
qb avoid the noise due to the insufficient bilin 
gum sentences, we adopted two significance filter-- 
ing methods that were introduced by Wu and Xia 
(1994). First, the Korean sentences consisting of 
words with more than 5 occurrences in the corpus 
are considered in the experiment. Second, we se.. 
lected the English words that accounts for the top 
0.80 of the translation probability density given a 
Korean word. 
When we selected 200 sentence pairs randomly 
and manually tested aligned results, we obtained 
68.7% precision at the phrase level and 89.2% 
precision of bilingual dictionary induced from the 
alignment. The table 3 and 4 illustrate tile bilin- 
gual knowledge acquired from the aligned results. 
The information in table 4 is the unique product 
of phrase-level alignment. 
3 Conc lus ion  
With the alignment of Koreanq~,nglish entences, 
the most serious problem, that is seldom found 
at indo-European language pairs, is how to over- 
come tile differences of word unit and word order. 
The proposed method is an extension of word level 
alignment and solves the problems of word unit 
mismatch and word order through phrase level 
alignment. We have also described several alter- 
natives of alignment and parameter estimation.

It produces more accurate bilingual dictionary 
than the nmthod using only word correspondence 
inf'orn~ation. Moreover, we can extract phrase- 
level information from the results of phrase level 
alignment. Also in the prot)osed method, the 
whoh; process of generating phrase units and lind- 
ing matching phrases, is done. mechauicMly with- 
out human intervention. One negative aspect is 
that l;he method requires large amount of training 
corpus lbr the saturated estimation of the model 
though larger data will increase tile accuracy of 
the performance. 
The proI)osed method may well he al)plied 
to other language pairs of similar structures as 
well as dissimilar ou(;s. Since the results from 
the method are richer with linguistic informa- 
tion, other applications uch as machine trans- 
lation and multilingual information retrieval are 
promising research areas.
