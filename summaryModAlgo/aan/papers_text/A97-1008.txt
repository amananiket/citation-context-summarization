Abstract 
As with human-human i teraction, spoken 
human-computer dialog will contain situa- 
tions where there is miscommunication. I  
experimental trials consisting of eight dif- 
ferent users, 141 problem-solving dialogs, 
and 2840 user utterances, the Circuit Fix-It 
Shop natural anguage dialog system misin- 
terpreted 18.5% of user utterances. These 
miscommunications created various prob- 
lems for the dialog interaction, ranging 
from repetitive dialog to experimenter in- 
tervention to occasional failure of the dia- 
log. One natural strategy for reducing the 
impact of miscommunication is selective 
verification of the user's utterances. This 
paper reports on both context-independent 
and context-dependent strategies for utter- 
ance verification that show that the use of 
dialog context is crucial for intelligent se- 
lection of which utterances to verify. 
1 Building Robust Spoken Natural 
Language Interfaces 
Recent advances in speech recognition technology 
have raised expectations about the development of 
practical spoken natural language (NL) interfaces. 
Such interfaces can provide user flexibility as well as 
allow users to devote their hands and eyes to the task 
at hand. In particular, the ability to obtain comput- 
erized telephone assistance via a robust NL interface 
could provide ready access to information that cur- 
rently requires direct human interaction. However, 
if such interfaces are to be effective with the gen- 
eral populous, they must be capable of dealing with 
miscommunication. Miscommunication can arise at 
several different levels, ranging from discourse struc- 
ture and speech act misunderstanding (McRoy and 
41 
Hirst, 1995) to misinterpretation due to misrecog- 
nition of a speaker's words. We report on a study 
that focuses on this latter type of miscommunica- 
tion. While speech recognizer performance in con- 
trolled environments has improved dramatically in 
the past decade, recognition errors still occur. Fur- 
thermore, current speech recognizers cannot perform 
optimally in uncontrolled environments such as tele- 
phone interactions. 
We examine the strategy of verification subdialogs 
for resolving miscommunications due to misrecog- 
nition. We first review how verification subdialogs 
can increase the rate of correct interpretation from 
81.5% to 97.4% but at a cost of unnecessary verifica- 
tions approximately once every five user utterances. 
However, by adopting a context-dependent strategy 
for deciding when to use a verification subdialog, we 
can maintain an understanding rate of 95.3% while 
reducing the number of unnecessary verifications by 
over one half. 
After describing the technique of selective utter- 
ance verification, this paper gives an overview of the 
dialog system environment that provides the data 
used in testing various strategies for selective ut- 
terance verification, the Circuit Fix-It Shop. The 
paper concludes with a description of both context- 
independent and context-dependent strategies for 
selective utterance verification and reports on the 
comparative r sults of dialog simulations using these 
strategies. The results show the importance of ex- 
ploiting dialog context for intelligent selection of 
which utterances to verify. 
2 Se lec t ive  Ver i f i ca t ion  of 
Quest ionab le  User  Inputs  
Every system that uses natural language under- 
standing will sometimes misunderstand its input. 
Misunderstandings can arise from speech recognition 
errors or inadequacies in the language grammar, or 
they may result from an input that is ungrammati- 
Spoken: i want to fix this circuit 
Recognized: power a six a circuit 
Spoken: the one is flashing for a longer period of time 
Recognized: one is flashing forth longer in a time

Recognized: stays know wire i connector one zero for 
Figure 1: Sample Utterances with Word Misrecognition 
cal or ambiguous. Here we focus on misunderstand- 
ings caused by speech recognition errors. Exam- 
ples of misrecognized inputs from interacting with 
the Circuit Fix-It Shop are given in figure 1. One 
method for reducing the number of misunderstand- 
ings is to require the user to verify each utterance 
by either speaking every utterance twice, or confirm- 
ing a word-by-word read back of every utterance 
(e.g., (Baber and Hone, 1993)). Such verification 
is effective at reducing errors that result from word 
misrecognitions, but does nothing to reduce misun- 
derstandings that result from other causes. Further- 
more, verification of all utterances can be needlessly 
wearisome to the user, especially if the system is 
working well. 
A better approach is to have the system verify its 
interpretation of an input only under circumstances 
where the accuracy of its interpretation is seriously 
in doubt, or correct understanding is essential to 
the success of the dialog. The verification is accom- 
plished through the use of a verification subdialog---a 
short sequence of utterances intended to confirm or 
reject the hypothesized interpretation. The follow- 
ing example of a verification subdialog illustrates the 
idea. 
Computer: What is the switch position when 
the LED is off7 
User: Up. 
Computer: Did you mean to say that the 
switch is up? 
User : Yes. 
Notable features of such verification subdialogs in- 
clude the following. 
? Verification is selective. A verification subdialog 
is initiated only if it is believed that the overall 
performance and accuracy of the dialog system 
will be improved. In this way, the dialog system 
responds much as a person would. 
? Verification is tunable. The propensity of the 
system to verify can be adjusted so as to pro- 
42 
vide any required level of speech understanding 
accuracy. 
? Verification operates at the semantic level. The 
system verifies an utterance's meaning, not its 
syntax. This helps overcome misunderstandings 
that result from inadequacies in the language 
model, or ungrammatical or ambiguous inputs. 
Two important definitions concerning selective 
verification are the following. An under-verification 
is defined as the event where the system generates 
a meaning that is incorrect but not verified. An 
over-verification occurs when a correct meaning is 
verified. The example just given is an example of an 
over-verification. The goal of any algorithm for se- 
lective utterance verification is to minimize the rate 
of under-verifications while also holding the rate of 
over-verifications to as low a value as possible. That 
is, the goal is to only verify utterances that need 
verifying, and to verify as many of these as possi- 
ble. In section 4 we report on the results of tests 
of various strategies for deciding when to engage in 
verification subdialogs within a specific dialog envi- 
ronment, the Circuit Fix-It Shop. In order to un- 
derstand the strategies used, an overview of this en- 
vironment must first be presented. 
3 Dialog Environment: The Circuit 
Fix-It Shop 
3.1 Genera l  Character i s t i cs  
The data used in this study were collected in ex- 
perimental trials conducted with "The Circuit Fix- 
It Shop," a spoken NL dialog system constructed 
in order to test the effectiveness of an integrated 
dialog processing model that permits variable ini- 
tiative behavior as described in (Smith and Hipp, 
1994) and (Smith, Hipp, and Biermann, 1995). The 
implemented ialog system assists users in repair- 
ing a Radio Shack 160 in One Electronic Project 
Kit. The particular circuit being used causes the 
Light-Emitting Diode (LED) to alternately display a 
one and seven. The system can detect errors caused 
by missing wires as well as a dead battery. Speech 
recognition is performed by a Verbex 6000 running 
on an IBM PC. To improve speech recognition per- 
formance we restrict the vocabulary to 125 words. 
A DECtalk DTCO1 text-to-speech onverter is used 
to provide spoken output by the computer. 
After testing system prototypes with a few vol- 
unteers, eight subjects used the system during the 
formal experimental phase. After a warmup ses- 
sion where the subject trained on the speech recog- 
nizer and practiced using the system, each subject 
participated in two sessions where up to ten prob- 
lems were attempted. Subjects attempted a total 
of 141 dialogs of which 118 or 84% were completed 
successfully. 1 The average speech rate by subjects 
was 2.9 sentences per minute; the average task com- 
pletion times for successful dialogs were 6.5 minutes. 
An excerpt from an actual interaction with the 
system is given in figure 2. 2 The words in paren- 
theses represent he actual sequence of words that 
the speech recognizer sent to the dialog system for 
analysis. As can be seen from the example, the sys- 
tem usually understood the user utterance (but not 
always). We next describe two features of the sys- 
tem that were useful in the interpretation process: 
(1) error-correcting parsing; and (2) dialog expec- 
tation. In section 4 we will see how these features 
assist in deciding when to engage the user in a veri- 
fication subdialog. 
3.2 Overcoming  Mis recogn i t ion  by  
Er ror -Cor rect ing  Pars ing  
The system was able to find the correct meaning for 
81.5% of the more than 2800 input utterances even 
though only 50% of these inputs were correctly rec- 
ognized word for word by use of an error-correcting 
parser that uses a dynamic programming approach 
similar to (Ney, 1991) to compute the best n parses 
for the input. What constitutes "best" is determined 
by a cost matrix for the possible words in the vocab- 
ulary and the given grammar. The cost matrix de- 
fines the cost for inserting or deleting words as well 
as the cost for a word substitution when such sub- 
stitutions are allowed. The intent is to permit sub- 
stitutions for words which sound very similar, such 
as "do" and "two/to/too," words that are likely to 
1 Of the 23 dialogs which were not completed, misun- 
derstandings due to misrecognition were the cause in 13 
of these failures. There were a variety of causes for the 
failure in the other 10 dialogs, ranging from inadequate 
grammar coverage to subject error in connecting wires.

O denotes utterances spoken by the user. 
43  
be confused by the speech recognizer. The parser 
performs insertions, deletions, and substitutions in 
order to transform the input into a grammatical  ut- 
terance. With each "grammatical" utterance is as- 
sociated a parse cost (PC), which is the sum of the 
costs of each insertion, deletion, and substitution re- 
quired for the transformation. For each of the best 
n parses, an expectation cost (EC) is also produced 
according to how likely the input is to occur accord- 
ing to the expectations. The total cost of a parse is 
a weighted sum of PC and EC. The values for these 
weights and costs have been assigned heuristically. 
Figure 3 shows some of the utterances uccessfully 
handled by the implemented system during the ex- 
periment. For instance, example 1 is transformed 
into a grammatical utterance by substituting the 
phonetically similar word "six" for "fix," and "and" 
for "can." This example would have a relatively low 
parse cost indicating the system has high confidence 
in its interpretation. On the other hand, example 3 
requires a large number of costly insertions and dele- 
tions, indicating a lack of confidence in the quality of 
the interpretation. As will be seen in section 4, this 
difference in scores is an important component in 
deciding when to engage in verification subdialogs. 
3.3 Expectation in Dialog 
An important phenomenon that is exploited in com- 
putational models of language is that of expectation 
(Allen, 1995). Based on the current context, there 
is an expectation of what is to come next. These ex- 
pectations can be for phonemes, morphemes, words, 
or meanings. For example, if we hear the word "the" 
we expect the next word to be either an adjective or 
noun. When the computer asks, "Is the knob po- 
sition at 10T', we have greatest expectation for a 
response of either "yes" or "no", lesser expectation 
for a sentence answer such as "The knob position 
is five.", and still less expectation for a clarifica- 
tion question or comment such as "Which knob?", 
"Where is the knob?", or "I do not see it." 
Consider the following dialog sample. 
i. C: Is there a wire between connector  
84 and connector  99? 
2. U: It is not there. 
3. C: Add a wire between connector  84 
and connector  99. 
4. U: I need help. 
5. C: Obtain a wire. 
6. U: Okay. 
The system must use the established ialog context 
in order to properly interpret every user utterance 
as follows. 
I. C: This is the Circuit Fix-It Shop. How may I help you? 
2. U: I want to fix this circuit. (power a six a circuit) 
3. C: I do not understand. Please repeat what you said. 
4. U: I want to fix this circuit (i want a fix a circuit) 
5. C: What is the ID of the circuit? 
6. U: RSl11. (rs111) 
7. C: I am famil iar with that circuit. The LED is supposed to be displaying 
alternately f lashing one and seven. 
8. U: The LED is displayin E nothing. (be led a displaying nothing) 
9. C: What is the switch at when the LED is off? 
10. U: The switch is down. (the switch yes down) 
11. C: Put the switch up. 
12. U: Done. (done) 
13. C: Put the knob to one zero. 
14. U: The knob is at one zero. (the knob and add one zero) 
15. C: What is the LED displaying? 
16. U: The LED is displaying a one and seven at the same time 
(be led a display?ng one an seven at the same time) 
17. C: Put the knob to zero. 
18. U: Done. (done) 
19. C: What is the LED displaying? 
20. U: The same thing. (the same same) 
21. C: Did you mean to say the LED is displaying the same thing? 
22. U: Yes. (yes)

? Utterance 2: to determine what "it" refers to 
(i.e., the wire from 84 to 99). 
? Utterance 4: to determine what the user needs 
help with (i.e., adding the wire). 
? Utterance 6: to determine whether "okay" de- 
notes confirmation or comprehension (i.e., con- 
firmation that the wire has been obtained). 
Effective use of expectation is necessary for con- 
straining the search for interpretations and achieving 
efficient processing of NL inputs. This is particularly 
crucial in spoken NL diMog, where speakers expect 
fast response times (Oviatt and Cohen, 1989). 
The system model of expectations i similar to 
that of (Young et al, 1989) in that we predict the 
meanings of possible user responses based on the cur- 
rent dialog goal. The details of the system model can 
be found in (Smith and Hipp, 1994). Here we re- 
view the key aspects that are exploited in a context- 
dependent strategy for verification. We define ex- 
pectations based on an abstract representation of
the current task goal. For example, 
goal(user, ach(prop( Obj, Prop Narne, PropValue) ) 3 
3This notation is an abbreviated form of the actual 
44 
denotes the goal that the user achieve the 
value (PropValue) for a particular property 
(PropName), of an object (Obj). The specific val- 
ues for Obj, PropName, and PropValue are filled 
in according to the current goal. For example, the 
goal of setting the switch position to up may be rep- 
resented as 
goal(user, ach (prop( switch, position, up))) 
while the goal of observing the knob's color would 
be 
goal(user, obs(prop(knob, color, PropYalue) ) ) 
where PropValue is an uninstantiated variable 
whose value should be specified in the user 
input. General expectations for the mean- 
ing of user responses to a goal of the form 
goal(user, ach(prop(...))) include the following: 
? A question about the location of Obj. 
? A question about how to do the action. 
? An assertion that Obj now has the value 
PropValue for property PropName. 
representation used in the system as described in (Smith 
and Hipp, 1994). 
Example i 
Computer: There is supposed to be a wire between connector 68 and connector 87. 
User: Wire connecting six eight and eight seven. 
Recognized: Wire connecting fix eight can eight seven. 
Example 2 
Computer: Putting the knob to one zero is desirable. 
User: The knob is at one zero. 
Recognized: Seven knob use that one zero. 
Example 3 
Computer: Is anything else on the LED on? 
User: LED is displaying a not flashing seven. 
Recognized: Be down it be yes displaying be knob flashing seven then.

Even when using error-correcting parsing and dia- 
log expectations, the Circuit Fix-It Shop misunder- 
stood 18.5% of user utterances during the experi- 
mental testing. We now turn our attention to an 
empirical study of strategies for selective utterance 
verification that attempt o select for verification as 
many of the misunderstood utterances as possible 
while minimizing the selection of utterances that 
were understood correctly. These strategies make 
use of information obtainable from dialog expecta- 
tion and the error-correcting parsing process.

4.1 S t ra tegy  1: Us ing  Parse  Cost  On ly  
An enhancement to the Circuit Fix-It Shop de- 
scribed in (Smith and Hipp, 1994) allows for a verifi- 
cation subdialog only when the hypothesized mean- 
ing is in doubt or when accuracy is critical for the 
success of the dialog. The decision of whether or 
not a particular input should be verified is made 
by computing for each meaning a parser confidence 
score (a measure of how plausible the parser's out- 
put is--this measure is proportional to the inverse 
of the total cost (section 3.2) normalized for utter- 
ance length) and a verification threshold (a measure 
of how important he meaning is toward the suc- 
cess of the dialog--greater importance is denoted by 
a higher threshold). The decision rule for deciding 
when to initiate a verification subdialog is specified 
45  
as follows: 
IF the Parser Confidence Score > the 
Verif ication Threshold THEN DO NOT 
engage in a verif ication subdialog 
ELSE 
engage in a verif ication subdialog 
This basic capability for verification subdialogs 
was not available during the 141 dialog experiment. 
However, simulations run on the collected data 
raised the percentage of utterances that are correctly 
understood from 81.5% to 97.4%. 4 Unfortunately, 
besides improving understanding through verifica- 
tion of utterances initially misinterpreted, the sys- 
tem also verified 19.2% of the utterances initially 
interpreted correctly. An example would be ask- 
ing, "Did you mean to say the switch is up?", when 
that is what the user originally said. These over- 
verifications result in extraneous dialog, and if ex- 
cessive, will limit usability. 
4.2 S t ra tegy  2" Us ing  Context  On ly  
The previous decision rule for utterance verification 
focused exclusively on the local information about 
parsing cost and ignores dialog context. In that sit- 
uation the over-verification rate was 19.2% while the 
4Consequently, the under-verification rate is 2.6%. 
We say that an utterance is correctly understood if it 
is either correctly interpreted initially, or is an utterance 
for which the system will engage the user in a verification 
subdialog. It is of course possible that the verification 
subdialog may not succeed, but we have not yet assessed 
the likelihood of that and thus do not consider this pos- 
sibility during the evaluation of the various strategies. 
? obs(prop(Obj, PropName, PropValue)) (PropValue unspecified)--observing a property. 
Example: a wh-question (e.g., "What is the switch position?") 
Main Expectation: direct answer (e.g., "The switch is up."). 
? obs(prop(Obj, PropName, PropValue)) (PropValue specified) 
Example: a yes-no question {e.g., "Is the switch up?") 
Main Expectation: (1) yes/no response and (2) a direct answer as in the above case. 
? obs(meas(Des, Val))--observing a measurement described by Des where Val is the value. 
Example: a wh-question (e.g., "What is the voltage between connectors 121 and 34?") 
Main Expectation: direct answer (e.g., "Seven" or "The voltage is seven"). 
? obs(behav(Obs, Cond))--observing a behavior where the result of the observation (Obs), depends on the 
underlying physical conditions present (Cond) when the observation was made. 
Example: a wh-question (e.g., "What is the LED displaying when the switch is up?") 
Main Expectation: a direct answer (e.g., "The LED is displaying only a not flashing seven."). 
? ach(prop(Obj, PropName, PropValue))--achieving a property. 
Example: a command (e.g., "Put the switch up.") 
Main Expectation: (1) completion acknowledgement (e.g., "Okay" 
desired property now exists (e.g., "The switch is up."). 
or "Done") and (2) assertion that the 
? learn(Fact)--learning a fact. The fact could concern a piece of state information (e.g., that the switch 
is located in the lower left portion of the circuit), that an action needs completing (e.g., "Putting the 
switch up is desirable,"), or that a certain property should or should not be true (e.g., there should be 
a wire between connectors 34 and 80). In all cases, one main expectation is an acknowledgment that 
the Fact is understood. In the case of an action completion or a property status, there is also a main 
expectation for either that the user completed the action (e.g., "Done" or "The switch is up"), or that 
the property status is verified (e.g., "Wire connecting 34 and 80"). 
Figure 4: Summary of Main Expectations for Major Goals 
under-verification rate was 2.6%. What about using 
a rule solely based on context? For each abstract 
task goal, we define a subset of the expectations as 
the main expectation. This subset consists of the 
expected meanings that denote a normal continua- 
tion of the task. Figure 4 lists these expectations for 
the major task goals of the model. For cooperative 
task-assistance dialog, making the assumption that 
the meaning of the user's utterance will belong to 
a very small subset of the expectations for each ab- 
stract goal allows us to define the following context- 
dependent decision rule for utterance verification. 
IF utterance in the Main Expectation THEN 
DO NOT engage in a verification 
subdialog 
ELSE 
engage in a verification suhdialog 
Using this decision rule, the over-verification rate 
rises to 31.8% while the under-verification rate falls 
to 1.4%. Although it significantly reduces the under- 
verification rate, this strategy clearly leads to an ex- 
46 
cessive number of over-verifications. We next con- 
sider combination strategies that look at both parse 
cost and context. 
4.3 S t ra tegy  3: Parse  Cost /Context  
Combination 
The Strategy 1 decision rule for utterance verifica- 
tion says to engage in a verification subdialog if the 
parser confidence value falls below the verification 
threshold. With context-dependent verification we 
additionally require that the utterance meaning can- 
not be part of the main expectation. Thus, the de- 
cision rule for verification may be revised as follows: 
IF the Parser Confidence Score > the 
Verification Threshold THEN DO NOT 
engage in a verification subdialog 
ELSE IF utterance meaning in the Main 
Expectation THEN DO NOT engage in a 
verification subdialog 
ELSE 
engage in a verification subdialog 
Using this decision rule and comparing it to Strat- 
egy 1, the over-verification rate drops from 19.2% 
to 7.6% while the under-verification rate rises from 
2.6% to 4.7% (i.e., the percentage of utterances cor- 
rectly understood falls from 97.4% to 95.3%). This 
corresponds to a reduction in over-verifications from 
once every 5.2 user utterances to once every 13.2 
user utterances while under-verifications (i.e., unde- 
tected misunderstandings) rises from once every 38.5 
user utterances to once every 21.3 user utterances. 
It should be noted that on average, users spoke 20 
utterances per dialog. We now examine a context- 
dependent strategy that takes into account specific 
domain information. 
4.4 S t ra tegy  4: Domaln -Dependent  
Except ions  
As previously noted, correctly interpreting certain 
utterances is crucial for efficient continuation of the 
dialog. In the Circuit Fix-It Shop, the crucial condi- 
tion was correct determination of the LED display. 
Several utterances in each dialog concerned a discus- 
sion of the LED display. Consequently, assertions 
about the LED display were often part of the main 
expectation. 
However, due to the myriad of possible LED dis- 
plays and the frequent misrecognition of key words 
and phrases in these descriptions, an effective di- 
alog system would want to be careful to ascertain 
correctness in interpreting these descriptions. Con- 
sequently, we modify the verification decision rule as 
follows: 
IF the Parser Confidence Score > the 
Verification Threshold THEN DO N0T 
engage in verification subdialog 
ELSE IF the utterance meaning is an 
assertion about the LED display THEN 
engage in a verification subdialog 
ELSE IF the utterance meaning is in the 
Main Expectation THEN DO NOT engage in 
a verification subdialog 
ELSE 
engage in a verification subdialog 
As a result, the decision rule for verifying utter- 
ances concerning the LED focuses solely on the local 
information about parsing cost and does not con- 
sider dialog context information about expectation. 5 
Such a modification might also be appropriate in 
5 In actuality, a small component of the total parsing 
cost is the expectation cost based on dialog context, but 
that weighting is negligible compared to the weighting 
of the parse cost, the predominant factor in computing 
total cost. 
47  
other domains for information deemed essential to 
continuing progress. 
For this final decision rule the the over-verification 
rate is 9.8% while the under-verification rate is 3.7%. 
4.5 S t ra tegy  Compars ion  
Table 1 summarizes the results of the four strate- 
gies for a fixed Verification Threshold. We con- 
clude that the combination of considering both the 
local information of the parsing cost and the dia- 
log context information about expectation provides 
the best strategy. We also note that inclusion of 
domain-dependent information does not show any 
notable improvement in the over-verification/under- 
verification tradeoff as compared with the context- 
dependent but domain-independent Strategy 3. 6 We 
believe the results show that for task-oriented o- 
mains where there are fairly strong expectations for 
utterances that relate directly to task goals such as 
those described in figure 4, a context-dependent ver- 
ification strategy is effective at reducing the over- 
verification rate to a reasonable amount while keep- 
ing the number of under-verifications to a near min- 
imum. Further study is needed to determine the 
practical usefulness of this strategy in an actual ex- 
perimental situation and it is an open question as 
to whether or not such strategies are feasible for less 
task-specific domains such as advisory dialogs and 
database query environments. 
4.6 Improv ing  Accuracy  
Obtaining a higher accuracy requires reducing the 
under-verification rate. For Strategy 1 we explored 
the impact of raising and lowering the threshold 
on the over- and under-verification rates. Not sur- 
prisingly, there was a tradeoff. As the threshold 
was raised, more utterances are verified, resulting in 
fewer under-verifications but more over-verifications. 
Lowering the threshold had the opposite impact. In 
fact, using just the strategy of lowering the threshold 
to reduce the over-verification rate to 9.3% causes 
the under-verification rate to rise to 8.0%. In con- 
trast, the new context-dependent strategy, Strat- 
egy 3, achieves an over-verification rate of 7.6%, but 
the under-verification rate is only 4.7%. Clearly, the 
use of dialog context in the verification subdialog de- 
cision rule improves ystem performance. Neverthe- 
less, a small set of under-verifications remains. Are 
there any possibilities for further reductions in the 
under-verifications without a substantial increase in 
the over-verification rate? 
~This of course, does not preclude the possibility that 
domain-dependent i eraction may be more useful in 
other domains.

Table 1: Comparative Performance ofVerification Subdialog Decision Strategies 
An analysis of the 133 under-verifications that oc- 
cur with the new strategy indicates that while some 
of the under-verifications are due to deficiencies in 
the grammar, there is a a core group of under- 
verifications where misrecognition of the speaker's 
words is impossible to overcome. Incorrect recogni- 
tion of digits, lost content words, and misrecognized 
content words can cause the system to have high 
confidence in an incorrect interpretation. One ap- 
proach that may prove helpful with this problem is 
the use of speech recognition systems that provide 
alternate hypotheses for the speech signal along with 
scoring information. Another possibility is word by 
word verification of the speaker input (see (Baber 
and Hone, 1993)), but such a strategy is too time- 
consuming and tedious for general spoken natural 
language dialog, especially when the user does not 
have access to a visual display of what the system 
hypothesizes was spoken. In general, experimental 
trials to observe subject reaction to verification sub- 
dialogs are needed. 
In conclusion, while useful, there appear to be 
limits to the effectiveness of verification subdi- 
alogs. Consequently, strategies for delayed etection 
and resolution of miscommunication (e.g. (McRoy 
and Hirst, 1995), (Brennan and Hulteen, 1995), 
and (Lambert and Carberry, 1992)) become nec- 
essary and remain an area of continued investiga- 
tion. These include both computer-initiated as well 
as user-initiated strategies.
