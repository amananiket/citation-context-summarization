Abstract 
Word subject domains have been 
widely used to improve the perform-
ance of word sense disambiguation al-
gorithms. However, comparatively little 
effort has been devoted so far to the 
disambiguation of word subject do-
mains. The few existing approaches 
have focused on the development of al-
gorithms specific to word domain dis-
ambiguation. In this paper we explore 
an alternative approach where word 
domain disambiguation is achieved via 
word sense disambiguation. Our study 
shows that this approach yields very 
strong results, suggesting that word 
domain disambiguation can be ad-
dressed in terms of word sense disam-
biguation with no need for special 
purpose algorithms.  
1 Introduction 
Word subject domains have been ubiquitously 
used in dictionaries to help human readers pin-
point the specific sense of a word by specifying 
technical usage, e.g. see ?subject field codes? in 
Procter (1978). In computational linguistics, 
word subject domains have been widely used to 
improve the performance of machine translation 
systems. For example, in a review of commonly 
used features in automated translation, Mowatt 
(1999) reports that most of the machine transla-
tion systems surveyed made use of word subject 
domains. Word subject domains have also been 
used in information systems. For example, San-
filippo (1998) describes a summarization system 
where subject domains provide users with useful 
conceptual parameters to tailor summary re-
quests to a user?s interest.  
Successful usage of word domains in applica-
tions such as machine translation and summari-
zation is strongly dependent on the ability to 
assign the appropriate subject domain to a word 
in its context. Such an assignment requires a 
process of Word Domain Disambiguation 
(WDD) because the same word can often be as-
signed different subject domains out of context 
(e.g. the word partner can potentially be re-
lated to FINANCE or MARRIAGE).  
Interestingly enough, word subject domains 
have been widely used to improve the perform-
ance of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) 
algorithms (Wilks and Stevenson 1998, Magnini 
et al 2001; Gliozzo et al 2004). However, com-
paratively little effort has been devoted so far to 
the word domain disambiguation itself. The 
most notable exceptions are the work of Magnini 
and Strapparava (2000) and Suarez & Palomar 
(2002). Both studies propose algorithms specific 
to the WDD task and have focused on the dis-
ambiguation of noun domains.  
In this paper we explore an alternative ap-
proach where word domain disambiguation is 
achieved via word sense disambiguation. More-
over, we extend the treatment of WDD to verbs 
and adjectives. Initial results show that this ap-
proach yield very strong results, suggesting that 
WDD can be addressed in terms of word sense 
disambiguation with no need of special purpose 
algorithms.

2 WDD via WSD 
Our approach relies on the use of WordNet Do-
mains (Bagnini and Cavagli? 2000) and can be 
outlined in the following two steps:  
1. use a WordNet-based WSD algorithm to 
assign a sense to each word in the input 
text, e.g. doctor  doctor#n#1 
2. use WordNet Domains to map disam-
biguated words into the subject domain 
associated with the word, e.g. doc-
tor#n#1doctor#n#1#MEDICINE. 
2.1 WordNet Domains 
WordNet Domains is an extension of WordNet 
(http://wordnet.princeton.edu/) where synonym 
sets have been annotated with one or more sub-
ject domain labels, as shown in Figure 1. Subject 
domains provide an interesting and useful classi-
fication which cuts across part of speech and 
WordNet sub-hierarchies. For example, doc-
tor#n#1 and operate#n#1 both have sub-
ject domain MEDICINE, and SPORT includes both 
athlete#n#1 with top hypernym life-
form#n#1 and sport#n#1 with  top hy-
pernym act#n#2.  
2.2 Word Sense Disambiguation 
To assign a sense to each word in the input text, 
we used the WSD algorithm presented in San-
filippo et al (2006). This WSD algorithm is 
based on a supervised classification approach 
that uses SemCor1 as training corpus. The algo-
rithm employs the OpenNLP MaxEnt imple-
mentation of the maximum entropy 
classification algorithm (Berger et al 1996) to 
develop word sense recognition signatures for 
each lemma which predicts the most likely sense 
for the lemma according to the context in which 
the lemma occurs. 
Following Dang & Palmer (2005) and Ko-
homban & Lee (2005), Sanfilippo et al (2006) 
use contextual, syntactic and semantic informa-
tion to inform our verb class disambiguation 
system.  
? Contextual information includes the verb 
under analysis plus three tokens found on 
each side of the verb, within sentence 
boundaries. Tokens included word as well 
as punctuation. 
? Syntactic information includes grammatical 
dependencies (e.g. subject, object) and mor-
pho-syntactic features such as part of 
speech, case, number and tense.  
? Semantic information includes named entity 
types (e.g. person, location, organization) 
and hypernyms. 
We chose this WSD algorithm as it provides 
some of the best published results to date, as the 
comparison with top performing WSD systems 
in Senseval3 presented in Table 1 shows---see 
http://www.senseval.org and Snyder & Palmer 
(2004) for terms of reference on Senseval3.

3 Evaluation 
To evaluate our WDD approach, we used both 
the SemCor and Senseval3 data sets. Both cor-
pora were stripped of their sense annotations and 
processed with an extension of the WSD algo-
rithm of Sanfilippo et al (2006) to assign a 
WordNet sense to each noun, verb and adjective. 
The extension consisted in extending the train-
ing data set so as to include a selection of 
WordNet examples (full sentences containing a 
main verb) and the Open Mind Word Expert 
corpus (Chklovski and Mihalcea 2002).  
The original hand-coded word sense annota-
tions of the SemCor and Senseval3 corpora and 
the word sense annotations assigned by the 
WSD algorithm used in this study were mapped 
into subject domain annotations using WordNet 
Domains, as described in the opening paragraph 
of section 2 above. The version of the SemCor 
and Senseval3 corpora where subject domain 
annotations were generated from hand-coded 
word senses served as gold standard.  A baseline 
for both corpora was obtained by assigning to 
each lemma the subject domain corresponding to 
sense 1 of the lemma.  
WDD results of a tenfold cross-validation for 
the SemCor data set are given in Table 2. Accu-
racy is high across nouns, verbs and adjectives.2 
To verify the statistical significance of these re-
sults against the baseline, we used a standard 
proportions comparison test (see Fleiss 1981, p. 
30). According to this test, the accuracy of our 
system is significantly better than the baseline.  
The high accuracy of our WDD algorithm is 
corroborated by the results for the Senseval3 
data set in Table 3. Such corroboration is impor-
tant as the Senseval3 corpus was not part of the 
data set used to train the WSD algorithm which 
provided the basis for subject domain assign-

ment. The standard comparison test for the Sen-
seval3 is not as conclusive as with SemCor. This 
is probably due to the comparatively smaller size 
of the Senseval3 corpus.

4 Comparison with Previous WDD 
Work 
Our WDD algorithm compares favorably with 
the approach explored in Bagnini and Strap-
parava (2000), who report 0.82 p/r in the WDD 
tasks for a subset of nouns in SemCor.  
Suarez and Palomar (2002) report WDD re-
sults of 78.7% accuracy for nouns against a 
baseline of 68.7% accuracy for the same data 
set. As in the present study, Suarez and Palomar 
derive the baseline by assigning to each lemma 
the subject domain corresponding to sense 1 of 
the lemma. Unfortunately, a meaningful com-
parison with Suarez and Palomar (2002) is not 
possible as they use a different data set, the DSO 
corpus.3 We are currently working on repeating 
our study with the DSO corpus and will include 
the results of this evaluation in the final version 
of the paper to achieve commensurability with 
the results reported by Suarez and Palomar. 
5 Conclusions and Further Work 
Current approaches to WDD have assumed that 
special purpose algorithms are needed to model 
the WDD task. We have shown that very com-
petitive and perhaps unrivaled results (pending 
on evaluation of our WDD algorithm with the 
DSO corpus) can be obtained using WSD as the 
basis for subject domain assignment. This im-
provement in WDD performance can be used to

obtain further gains in WSD accuracy, following 
Wilks and Stevenson (1998), Magnini et al 
(2001) and Gliozzo et al (2004). A more accu-
rate WSD model will in turn yield yet better 
WDD results, as demonstrated in this paper. 
Consequently, further improvements in accuracy 
for both WSD and WDD can be expected 
through a bootstrapping cycle where WDD re-
sults are fed as input to the WSD process, and 
the resulting improved WSD model is then used 
to achieve better WDD results. We intend to 
explore this possibility in future extensions of 
this work.
