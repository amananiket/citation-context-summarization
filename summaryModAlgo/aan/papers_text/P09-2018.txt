Abstract
Distributional word similarity is most
commonly perceived as a symmetric re-
lation. Yet, one of its major applications
is lexical expansion, which is generally
asymmetric. This paper investigates the
nature of directional (asymmetric) similar-
ity measures, which aim to quantify distri-
butional feature inclusion. We identify de-
sired properties of such measures, specify
a particular one based on averaged preci-
sion, and demonstrate the empirical bene-
fit of directional measures for expansion.
1 Introduction
Much work on automatic identification of seman-
tically similar terms exploits Distributional Simi-
larity, assuming that such terms appear in similar
contexts. This has been now an active research
area for a couple of decades (Hindle, 1990; Lin,
1998; Weeds and Weir, 2003).
This paper is motivated by one of the prominent
applications of distributional similarity, namely
identifying lexical expansions. Lexical expansion
looks for terms whose meaning implies that of a
given target term, such as a query. It is widely
employed to overcome lexical variability in ap-
plications like Information Retrieval (IR), Infor-
mation Extraction (IE) and Question Answering
(QA). Often, distributional similarity measures are
used to identify expanding terms (e.g. (Xu and
Croft, 1996; Mandala et al, 1999)). Here we de-
note the relation between an expanding term u and
an expanded term v as ?u ? v?.
While distributional similarity is most promi-
nently modeled by symmetric measures, lexical
expansion is in general a directional relation. In
IR, for instance, a user looking for ?baby food?
will be satisfied with documents about ?baby pap?
or ?baby juice? (?pap ? food?, ?juice ? food?);
but when looking for ?frozen juice? she will not
be satisfied by ?frozen food?. More generally, di-
rectional relations are abundant in NLP settings,
making symmetric similarity measures less suit-
able for their identification.
Despite the need for directional similarity mea-
sures, their investigation counts, to the best of
our knowledge, only few works (Weeds and Weir,
2003; Geffet and Dagan, 2005; Bhagat et al,
2007; Szpektor and Dagan, 2008; Michelbacher et
al., 2007) and is utterly lacking. From an expan-
sion perspective, the common expectation is that
the context features characterizing an expanding
word should be largely included in those of the ex-
panded word.
This paper investigates the nature of directional
similarity measures. We identify their desired
properties, design a novel measure based on these
properties, and demonstrate its empirical advan-
tage in expansion settings over state-of-the-art
measures
1
. In broader prospect, we suggest that
asymmetric measures might be more suitable than
symmetric ones for many other settings as well.
2 Background
The distributional word similarity scheme follows
two steps. First, a feature vector is constructed
for each word by collecting context words as fea-
tures. Each feature is assigned a weight indicating
its ?relevance? (or association) to the given word.
Then, word vectors are compared by some vector
similarity measure.

To date, most distributional similarity research
concentrated on symmetric measures, such as the
widely cited and competitive (as shown in (Weeds
and Weir, 2003)) LIN measure (Lin, 1998):
LIN(u, v) =
?
f?FV
u
?FV
v
[w
u
(f) + w
v
(f)]
?
f?FV
u
w
u
(f) +
?
f?FV
v
w
v
(f)
where FV
x
is the feature vector of a word x and
w
x
(f) is the weight of the feature f in that word?s
vector, set to their pointwise mutual information.
Few works investigated a directional similarity
approach. Weeds and Weir (2003) and Weeds et
al. (2004) proposed a precision measure, denoted
here WeedsPrec, for identifying the hyponymy re-
lation and other generalization/specification cases.
It quantifies the weighted coverage (or inclusion)
of the candidate hyponym?s features (u) by the hy-
pernym?s (v) features:
WeedsPrec(u ? v) =
?
f?FV
u
?FV
v
w
u
(f)
?
f?FV
u
w
u
(f)
The assumption behind WeedsPrec is that if one
word is indeed a generalization of the other then
the features of the more specific word are likely to
be included in those of the more general one (but
not necessarily vice versa).
Extending this rationale to the textual entail-
ment setting, Geffet and Dagan (2005) expected
that if the meaning of a word u entails that of
v then all its prominent context features (under
a certain notion of ?prominence?) would be in-
cluded in the feature vector of v as well. Their
experiments indeed revealed a strong empirical
correlation between such complete inclusion of
prominent features and lexical entailment, based
on web data. Yet, such complete inclusion cannot
be feasibly assessed using an off-line corpus, due
to the huge amount of required data.
Recently, (Szpektor and Dagan, 2008) tried
identifying the entailment relation between
lexical-syntactic templates using WeedsPrec, but
observed that it tends to promote unreliable rela-
tions involving infrequent templates. To remedy
this, they proposed to balance the directional
WeedsPrec measure by multiplying it with the
symmetric LIN measure, denoted here balPrec:
balPrec(u?v)=
?
LIN(u, v)?WeedsPrec(u?v)
Effectively, this measure penalizes infrequent tem-
plates having short feature vectors, as those usu-
ally yield low symmetric similarity with the longer
vectors of more common templates.
3 A Statistical Inclusion Measure
Our research goal was to develop a directional
similarity measure suitable for learning asymmet-
ric relations, focusing empirically on lexical ex-
pansion. Thus, we aimed to quantify most effec-
tively the above notion of feature inclusion.
For a candidate pair ?u ? v?, we will refer to
the set of u?s features, which are those tested for
inclusion, as tested features. Amongst these fea-
tures, those found in v?s feature vector are termed
included features.
In preliminary data analysis of pairs of feature
vectors, which correspond to a known set of valid
and invalid expansions, we identified the follow-
ing desired properties for a distributional inclusion
measure. Such measure should reflect:
1. the proportion of included features amongst
the tested ones (the core inclusion idea).
2. the relevance of included features to the ex-
panding word.
3. the relevance of included features to the ex-
panded word.
4. that inclusion detection is less reliable if the
number of features of either expanding or ex-
panded word is small.
3.1 Average Precision as the Basis for an
Inclusion Measure
As our starting point we adapted the Average
Precision (AP) metric, commonly used to score
ranked lists such as query search results. This
measure combines precision, relevance ranking
and overall recall (Voorhees and Harman, 1999):
AP =
?
N
r=1
[P (r) ? rel(r)]
total number of relevant documents
where r is the rank of a retrieved document
amongst the N retrieved, rel(r) is an indicator
function for the relevance of that document, and
P (r) is precision at the given cut-off rank r.
In our case the feature vector of the expanded
word is analogous to the set of all relevant docu-
ments while tested features correspond to retrieved
documents. Included features thus correspond to
relevant retrieved documents, yielding the follow-
70
ing analogous measure in our terminology:
AP (u ? v) =
?
|FV
u
|
r=1
[P (r) ? rel(f
r
)]
|FV
v
|
rel(f) =
{
1, if f ? FV
v
0, if f /? FV
v
P (r) =
|included features in ranks 1 to r|
r
where f
r
is the feature at rank r in FV
u
.
This analogy yields a feature inclusion measure
that partly addresses the above desired properties.
Its score increases with a larger number of in-
cluded features (correlating with the 1
st
property),
while giving higher weight to highly ranked fea-
tures of the expanding word (2
nd
property).
To better meet the desired properties we in-
troduce two modifications to the above measure.
First, we use the number of tested features |FV
u
|
for normalization instead of |FV
v
|. This captures
better the notion of feature inclusion (1
st
property),
which targets the proportion of included features
relative to the tested ones.
Second, in the classical AP formula all relevant
documents are considered relevant to the same ex-
tent. However, features of the expanded word dif-
fer in their relevance within its vector (3
rd
prop-
erty). We thus reformulate rel(f) to give higher
relevance to highly ranked features in |FV
v
|:
rel
?
(f) =
{
1 ?
rank(f,FV
v
)
|FV
v
|+1
, if f ? FV
v
0 , if f /? FV
v
where rank(f, FV
v
) is the rank of f in FV
v
.
Incorporating these twomodifications yields the
APinc measure:
APinc(u?v)=
?
|FV
u
|
r=1
[P (r) ? rel
?
(f
r
)]
|FV
u
|
Finally, we adopt the balancing approach in
(Szpektor and Dagan, 2008), which, as explained
in Section 2, penalizes similarity for infrequent
words having fewer features (4
th
property) (in our
version, we truncated LIN similarity lists after top
1000 words). This yields our proposed directional
measure balAPinc:
balAPinc(u?v) =
?
LIN(u, v) ? APinc(u?v)
4 Evaluation and Results
4.1 Evaluation Setting
We tested our similarity measure by evaluating its
utility for lexical expansion, compared with base-
lines of the LIN, WeedsPrec and balPrec measures
(Section 2) and a balanced version of AP (Sec-
tion 3), denoted balAP. Feature vectors were cre-
ated by parsing the Reuters RCV1 corpus and tak-
ing the words related to each term through a de-
pendency relation as its features (coupled with the
relation name and direction, as in (Lin, 1998)). We
considered for expansion only terms that occur at
least 10 times in the corpus, and as features only
terms that occur at least twice.
As a typical lexical expansion task we used
the ACE 2005 events dataset
2
. This standard IE
dataset specifies 33 event types, such as Attack,
Divorce, and Law Suit, with all event mentions
annotated in the corpus. For our lexical expan-
sion evaluation we considered the first IE subtask
of finding sentences that mention the event.
For each event we specified a set of representa-
tive words (seeds), by selecting typical terms for
the event (4 on average) from its ACE definition.
Next, for each similarity measure, the terms found
similar to any of the event?s seeds (?u ? seed?)
were taken as expansion terms. Finally, to mea-
sure the sole contribution of expansion, we re-
moved from the corpus all sentences that contain
a seed word and then extracted all sentences that
contain expansion terms as mentioning the event.
Each of these sentences was scored by the sum of
similarity scores of its expansion terms.
To evaluate expansion quality we compared the
ranked list of sentences for each event to the gold-
standard annotation of event mentions, using the
standard Average Precision (AP) evaluation mea-
sure. We report Mean Average Precision (MAP)
for all events whose AP value is at least 0.1 for at
least one of the tested measures
3
.
4.1.1 Results
Table 1 presents the results for the different tested
measures over the ACE experiment. It shows that
the symmetric LIN measure performs significantly
worse than the directional measures, assessing that
a directional approach is more suitable for the ex-
pansion task. In addition, balanced measures con-
sistently perform better than unbalanced ones.
According to the results, balAPinc is the best-
performing measure. Its improvement over all
other measures is statistically significant accord-
ing to the two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test

The remaining events seemed useless for our compar-
ative evaluation, since suitable expansion lists could not be
found for them by any of the distributional methods.

presents a sample of the top expansion terms
learned for some ACE seeds with either LIN or
balAPinc, demonstrating the more accurate ex-
pansions generated by balAPinc. These results
support the design of our measure, based on the
desired properties that emerged from preliminary
data analysis for lexical expansion.
Finally, we note that in related experiments we
observed statistically significant advantages of the
balAPincmeasure for an unsupervised text catego-
rization task (on the 10 most frequent categories in
the Reuters-21578 collection). In this setting, cat-
egory names were taken as seeds and expanded by
distributional similarity, further measuring cosine
similarity with categorized documents similarly to
IR query expansion. These experiments fall be-
yond the scope of this paper and will be included
in a later and broader description of our work.
5 Conclusions and Future work
This paper advocates the use of directional similar-
ity measures for lexical expansion, and potentially
for other tasks, based on distributional inclusion of
feature vectors. We first identified desired proper-
ties for an inclusion measure and accordingly de-
signed a novel directional measure based on av-
eraged precision. This measure yielded the best
performance in our evaluations. More generally,
the evaluations supported the advantage of multi-
ple directional measures over the typical symmet-
ric LIN measure.
Error analysis showed that many false sentence
extractions were caused by ambiguous expanding
and expanded words. In future work we plan to
apply disambiguation techniques to address this
problem. We also plan to evaluate the performance
of directional measures in additional tasks, and
compare it with additional symmetric measures.
