Abstract
We present a new method for detecting and
disambiguating named entities in open do-
main text. A disambiguation SVM kernel
is trained to exploit the high coverage and
rich structure of the knowledge encoded
in an online encyclopedia. The resulting
model significantly outperforms a less in-
formed baseline.
1 Introduction
1.1 Motivation
The de-facto web search paradigm defines the re-
sult to a user?s query as roughly a set of links to the
best-matching documents selected out of billions
of items available. Whenever the queries search
for pinpointed, factual information, the burden
of filling the gap between the output granularity
(whole documents) and the targeted information (a
set of sentences or relevant phrases) stays with the
users, by browsing the returned documents in or-
der to find the actually relevant bits of information.
A frequent case are queries about named entities,
which constitute a significant fraction of popu-
lar web queries according to search engine logs.
When submitting queries such as John Williams
or Python, search engine users could also be pre-
sented with a compilation of facts and specific at-
tributes about those named entities, rather than a
set of best-matching web pages. One of the chal-
lenges in creating such an alternative search result
page is the inherent ambiguity of the queries, as
several instances of the same class (e.g., different
people) or different classes (e.g., a type of snake,
a programming language, or a movie) may share
the same name in the query. As an example, the
Work done during a summer internship at Google.
contexts below are part of web documents refer-
ring to different people who share the same name
John Williams:
1. ?John Williams and the Boston Pops con-
ducted a summer Star Wars concert at Tan-
glewood.?
2. ?John Williams lost a Taipei death match
against his brother, Axl Rotten.?
3. ?John Williams won a Victoria Cross for his
actions at the battle of Rorke?s Drift.?
The effectiveness of the search could be greatly
improved if the search results were grouped
together according to the corresponding sense,
rather than presented as a flat, sense-mixed list
of items (whether links to full-length documents,
or extracted facts). As an added benefit, users
would have easier access to a wider variety of re-
sults, whenever the top 10 or so results returned by
the largest search engines happen to refer to only
one particular (arguably the most popular) sense
of the query (e.g., the programming language in
the case of Python), thus submerging or ?hiding?
documents that refer to other senses of the query.
In various natural language applications, signif-
icant performance gains are achieved as a func-
tion of data size rather than algorithm complex-
ity, as illustrated by the increasingly popular use
of the web as a (very large) corpus (Dale, 2003).
It seems therefore natural to try to exploit the web
in order to also improve the performance of re-
lation extraction, i.e. the discovery of useful re-
lationships between named entities mentioned in
text documents. However, if one wants to combine
evidence from multiple web pages, then one needs
again to solve the name disambiguation problem.
9
Without solving it, a relation extraction system an-
alyzing the sentences in the above example could
mistakenly consider the third as evidence that John
Williams the composer fought at Rorke?s Drift.
1.2 Approach
The main goal of the research reported in this pa-
per is to develop a named entity disambiguation
method that is intrinsically linked to a dictionary
mapping proper names to their possible named en-
titiy denotations. More exactly, the method:
1. Detects whether a proper name refers to a
named entity included in the dictionary (de-
tection).
2. Disambiguates between multiple named enti-
ties that can be denoted by the same proper
name (disambiguation).
As a departure from the methodology of previous
approaches, the paper exploits a non-traditional
web-based resource. Concretely, it takes advan-
tage of some of the human knowledge available
in Wikipedia, a free online encyclopedia created
through decentralized, collective efforts of thou-
sands of users (Remy, 2002). We show that the
structure of Wikipedia lends itself to a set of
useful features for the detection and disambigua-
tion of named entities. The remainder of the pa-
per is organized as follows. Section 2 describes
Wikipedia, with an emphasis on the features that
are most important to the entity disambiguation
task. Section 3 describes the extraction of named
entity entries (versus other types of entries) from
Wikipedia. Section 4 introduces two disambigua-
tion methods, which are evaluated experimentally
in Section 5. We conclude with future work and
conclusions.
2 Wikipedia ? A Wiki Encyclopedia
Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia written
collaboratively by volunteers, using a wiki soft-
ware that allows almost anyone to add and change
articles. It is a multilingual resource - there are
about 200 language editions with varying levels
of coverage. Wikipedia is a very dynamic and
quickly growing resource ? articles about news-
worthy events are often added within days of their
occurrence. As an example, the September 2005
version contains 751,666 articles, around 180,000
more articles than four months earlier. The work
in this paper is based on the English version from
May 2005, which contains 577,860 articles.
Each article in Wikipedia is uniquely identified
by its title ? a sequence of words separated by
underscores, with the first word always capital-
ized. Typically, the title is the most common name
for the entity described in the article. When the
name is ambiguous, it is further qualified with a
parenthetical expression. For instance, the arti-
cle on John Williams the composer has the title
John Williams (composer).
Because each article describes a specific en-
tity or concept, the remainder of the paper some-
times uses the term ?entity? interchangeably to re-
fer to both the article and the corresponding entity.
Also, let E denote the entire set of entities from
Wikipedia. For any entity e2E, e:title is the title
name of the corresponding article, and e:T is the
text of the article.
In general, there is a many-to-many correspon-
dence between names and entities. This relation
is captured in Wikipedia through redirect and dis-
ambiguation pages, as described in the next two
sections.
2.1 Redirect Pages
A redirect page exists for each alternative name
that can be used to refer to an entity in Wikipedia.
The name is transformed (using underscores for
spaces) into a title whose article contains a
redirect link to the actual article for that en-
tity. For example, John Towner Williams is the
full name of the composer John Williams. It
is therefore an alternative name for the com-
poser, and consequently the article with the ti-
tle John Towner Williams is just a pointer to the
article for John Williams (composer). An exam-
ple entry with a considerably higher number of
redirect pages is United States. Its redirect pages
correspond to acronyms (U.S.A., U.S., USA, US),
Spanish translations (Los Estados Unidos, Esta-
dos Unidos), misspellings (Untied States) or syn-
onyms (Yankee land).
For any given Wikipedia entity e2E, let e:R be
the set of all names that redirect to e.
2.2 Disambiguation Pages
Another useful structure is that of disambiguation
pages, which are created for ambiguous names,
i.e. names that denote two or more entities in
Wikipedia. For example, the disambiguation page
for the name John Williams lists 22 associated

Table 1: Examples of Wikipedia titles, aliases and categories
entities. Therefore, besides the non-ambiguous
names that come from redirect pages, additional
aliases can be found by looking for all disam-
biguation pages that list a particular Wikipedia en-
tity. In his philosophical article ?On Sense and
Reference? (Frege, 1999), Gottlob Frege gave a
famous argument to show that sense and reference
are distinct. In his example, the planet Venus may
be referred to using the phrases ?morning star? and
?evening star?. This theoretical example is nicely
captured in practice in Wikipedia by two disam-
biguation pages, Morning Star and Evening Star,
both listing Venus as a potential referent.
For any given Wikipedia entity e 2 E, let e:D
be the set of names whose disambiguation pages
contain a link to e.
2.3 Categories
Every article in Wikipedia is required to have at
least one category. As shown in Table 1, John
Williams (composer) is associated with a set of
categories, among them Star Wars music, Film
score composers, and 20th century classical com-
posers. Categories allow articles to be placed into
one or more topics. These topics can be further
categorized by associating them with one or more
parent categories. In Table 1 Venus is shown as
both an article title and a category. As a cate-
gory, it has one direct parent Planets of the Solar
System, which in turn belongs to two more gen-
eral categories, Planets and Solar System. Thus,
categories form a directed acyclic graph, allowing
multiple categorization schemes to co-exist simul-
taneously. There are in total 59,759 categories in
Wikipedia.
For a given Wikipedia entity e 2E, let e:C be
the set of categories to which e belongs (i.e. e?s
immediate categories and all their ancestors in the
Wikipedia taxonomy).
2.4 Hyperlinks
Articles in Wikipedia often contain mentions of
entities that already have a corresponding arti-
cle. When contributing authors mention an ex-
isting Wikipedia entity inside an article, they are
required to link at least its first mention to the cor-
responding article, by using links or piped links.
Both types of links are exemplified in the follow-
ing wiki source code of a sentence from the article
on Italy: ?The [[Vatican City|Vatican]] is now an
independent enclave surrounded by [[Rome]]?.
The string from the second link (?Rome?) denotes
the title of the referenced article. The same string
is also used in the display version. If the author
wants another string displayed (e.g., ?Vatican? in-
stead of ?Vatican City?), then the alternative string
is included in a piped link, after the title string.
Consequently, the display string for the aforemen-
tioned example is: ?The Vatican is now an inde-
pendent enclave surrounded by Rome?. As de-
scribed later in Section 4, the hyperlinks can pro-
vide useful training examples for a named entity
disambiguator.
3 A Dictionary of Named Entities
We organize all named entities from Wikipedia
into a dictionary structure D, where each string
entry d 2 D is mapped to the set of entities
d:E that can be denoted by d in Wikipedia. The
first step is to identify named entities, i.e. entities
with a proper name title. Because every title in
Wikipedia must begin with a capital letter, the de-
cision whether a title is a proper name relies on the
following sequence of heuristic steps:
11
1. If e:title is a multiword title, check the cap-
italization of all content words, i.e. words
other than prepositions, determiners, con-
junctions, relative pronouns or negations.
Consider e a named entity if and only if all
content words are capitalized.
2. If e:title is a one word title that contains at
least two capital letters, then e is a named en-
tity. Otherwise, go to step 3.
3. Count how many times e:title occurs in the
text of the article, in positions other than at
the beginning of sentences. If at least 75% of
these occurrences are capitalized, then e is a
named entity.
The combined heuristics extract close to half a
million named entities from Wikipedia. The sec-
ond step constructs the actual dictionary D as fol-
lows:
 The set of entries in D consists of all strings
that may denote a named entity, i.e. if e2E
is a named entity, then its title name e:title,
its redirect names e:R, and its disambigua-
tion names e:D are all added as entries in D.
 Each entry string d2D is mapped to d:E, the
set of entities that d may denote in Wikipedia.
Consequently, a named entity e is included in
d:E if and only if d = e:title, d 2 e:R, or
d2e:D.
4 Named Entity Disambiguation
As illustrated in Section 1, the same proper name
may refer to more than one named entity. The
named entity dictionary from Section 3 and the hy-
perlinks from Wikipedia articles provide a dataset
of disambiguated occurrences of proper names,
as described in the following. As shown in Sec-
tion 2.4, each link contains the title name of an en-
tity, and the proper name (the display string) used
to refer to it. We use the term query to denote the
occurrence of a proper name inside a Wikipedia
article. If there is a dictionary entry matching the
proper name in the query q such that the set of
denoted entities q:E contains at least two entities,
one of them the true answer entity q:e, then the
query q is included in the dataset. More exactly, if
q:E contains n named entities e
1
, e
2
, ..., e
n
, then
the dataset will be augmented with n pairs hq; e
k
i
represented as follows:
hq; e
k
i = [?(e
k
; q:e) j q:T j e
k
:title]
The field q:T contains all words occurring in a
limit length window centered on the proper name.
The window size is set to 55, which is the value
that was observed to give optimum performance
in the related task of cross-document coreference
(Gooi and Allan, 2004). The Kronecker delta
function ?(e
k
; q:e) is 1 when e
k
is the same as
the entity q:e referred in the link. Table 2 lists
the query pairs created for the three John Williams
queries from Section 1.1, assuming only three en-
tities in Wikipedia correspond to this name.

Table 2: Disambiguation dataset.
The application of this procedure on Wikipedia
results into a dataset of 1,783,868 disambiguated
queries.
4.1 Context-Article Similarity
Using the representation from the previous sec-
tion, the name entity disambiguation problem can
be cast as a ranking problem. Assuming that an
appropriate scoring function score(q; e
k
) is avail-
able, the named entity corresponding to query q is
defined to be the one with the highest score:
e^ = argmax
e
k
score(q; e
k
) (1)
If e^ = q:e then e^ represents a hit, otherwise e^ is
a miss. Disambiguation methods will then differ
based on the way they define the scoring function.
One ranking function that is evaluated experimen-
tally in this paper is based on the cosine similarity
between the context of the query and the text of
the article:
score(q; e
k
) = cos(q:T; e
k
:T ) =
q:T
kq:Tk
e
k
:T
ke
k
:Tk
The factors q:T and e
k
:T are represented in the
standard vector space model, where each compo-
nent corresponds to a term in the vocabulary, and
the term weight is the standard tf  idf score
(Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999). The vo-
cabulary V is created by reading all Wikipedia
12
articles and recording, for each word stem w, its
document frequency df(w) in Wikipedia. Stop-
words and words that are too frequent or too rare
are discarded. A generic document d is then repre-
sented as a vector of length jV j, with a position for
each vocabulary word. If f(w) is the frequency of
word w in document d, and N is the total num-
ber of Wikipedia articles, then the weight of word
w2V in the tf  idf representation of d is:
d
w
= f(w) ln
N
df(w)
(2)
4.2 Taxonomy Kernel
An error analysis of the cosine-based ranking
method reveals that, in many cases, the pair hq; ei
fails to rank first, even though words from the
query context unambiguously indicate e as the ac-
tual denoted entity. In these cases, cue words from
the context do not appear in e?s article due to two
main reasons:
1. The article may be too short or incomplete.
2. Even though the article captures most of the
relevant concepts expressed in the query con-
text, it does this by employing synonymous
words or phrases.
The cosine similarity between q and e
k
can be seen
as an expression of the total degree of correlation
between words from the context of query q and a
given named entity e
k
. When the correlation is too
low because the Wikipedia article for named entity
e
k
does not contain all words that are relevant to
e
k
, it is worth considering the correlation between
context words and the categories to which e
k
be-
longs. For illustration, consider the two queries
for the name John Williams from Figure 1.
To avoid clutter, Figure 1 depicts only two enti-
ties with the name John Williams in Wikipedia: the
composer and the wrestler. On top of each entity,
the figure shows one of their Wikipedia categories
(Film score composers and Professional wrestlers
respectively), together with some of their ances-
tor categories in the Wikipedia taxonomy. The
two query contexts are shown at the bottom of
the figure. In the context on the left, words such
as conducted and concert denote concepts that are
highly correlated with the Musicians, Composers
and Film score composers categories. On the other
hand, their correlation with other categories in
Figure 1 is considerably lower. Consequently, a

goal of this paper is to design a disambiguation
method that 1) learns the magnitude of these cor-
relations, and 2) uses these correlations in a scor-
ing function, together with the cosine similarity.
Our intuition is that, given the query context on the
left, such a ranking function has a better chance
of ranking the ?composer? entity higher than the
?wrestler? entity, when compared with the simple
cosine similarity baseline.
We consider using a linear ranking function as
follows:
e^ = argmax
e

w (q; e

The feature vector (q; e
k
) contains a dedicated

The weight vector w models the magnitude
of each word-category correlation, and can be
learned by training on the query dataset described
at the beginning of Section 4. We used the kernel
version of the large-margin ranking approach from
(Joachims, 2002) which solves the optimization
13
problem in Figure 2. The aim of this formulation is
to find a weight vector w such that 1) the number
of ranking constraints w (q; q:e)  w (q; e
k
)
from the training data that are violated is mini-
mized, and 2) the ranking function w (q; e
k
)
generalizes well beyond the training data.

C is a parameter that allows trading-off margin
size against training error. The number of linear
ranking constraints is
P
q
(jq:Ej   1). As an ex-
ample, each of the three queries from Table 2 gen-
erates two constraints.
The learned w is a linear combination of the
feature vectors (q; e
k
), which makes it possible
to use kernels (Vapnik, 1998). It is straightforward
to show that the dot product between two feature
vectors (q; e
k
) and (q0; e0
k
) is equal with the
product between the number of common words in
the contexts of the two queries and the number of
categories common to the two named entities, plus
the product of the two cosine similarities. The cor-
responding ranking kernel is:

In (McCallum et al, 1998), a statistical technique
called shrinkage is used in order to improve the
accuracy of a naive Bayes text classifier. Accord-
ingly, one can take advantage of a hierarchy of
classes by combining parameter estimates of par-
ent categories into the parameter estimates of a
child category. The taxonomy kernel is very re-
lated to the same technique ? one can actually re-
gard it as a distribution-free analogue of shrinkage.
4.3 Detecting Out-of-Wikipedia Entities
The two disambiguation methods discussed above
(Sections 4.1 and 4.2) implicitly assume that
Wikipedia contains all entities that may be de-
noted by entries from the named entity dictionary.
Taking for example the name John Williams, both
methods assume that in any context, the referred
entity is among the 22 entities listed on the dis-
ambiguation page in Wikipedia. In practice, there
may be contexts where John Williams refers to an
entity e
out
that is not covered in Wikipedia, es-
pecially when e
out
is not a popular entity. These
out-of-Wikipedia entities are accommodated in the
ranking approach to disambiguation as follows. A
special entity e
out
is introduced to denote any en-
tity not covered by Wikipedia. Its attributes are
set to null values (e.g., the article text e
out
:T = ;,
and the set of categories e
out
:C = ;). The rank-
ing in Equation 1 is then updated so that it returns
the Wikipedia entity with the highest score, if this
score is greater then a fix threshold  , otherwise it
returns e
out
:
e
max
= argmax
e
k
score(q; e
k
)
e^ =

e
max
if score(q; e
max
) > ;
e
out
otherwise:
If the scoring function is implemented as a
weighted combination of feature functions, as in
Equation 3, then the modification shown above re-
sults into a new feature 
out
:

out
(q; e
k
) = ?(e
k
; e
out
) (5)
The associated weight  is learned along with the
weights for the other features (as defined in Equa-
tion 5).
5 Experimental Evaluation
The taxonomy kernel was trained using the
SVMlight package (Joachims, 1999). As de-
scribed in Section 4, through its hyperlinks,
Wikipedia provides a dataset of 1,783,868 am-
biguous queries that can be used for training
a named entity disambiguator. The apparently
high number of queries actually corresponds to
a moderate size dataset, given that the space
of parameters includes one parameter for each
word-category combination. However, assuming
SVMlight does not run out of memory, using the
entire dataset for training and testing is extremely

time consuming. Therefore, we decided to evalu-
ate the taxonomy kernel under the following sce-
narios:
 [S
1
] The working set of Wikipedia categories C
1
is restricted to only the 110 top level categories un-
der People by occupation. The query dataset used
for training and testing is reduced to contain only
ambiguous queries hq; e
k
i for which any potential
matching entity e
k
belongs to at least one of the
110 categories (i.e. e
k
:C \ C
1
6= ;). The set of
negative matching entities e
k
is also reduced to
those that differ from the true answer e in terms
of their categories from C
1
(i.e. e
k
:C \ C
1
6=
e:C \C
1
). In other words, this scenario addresses
the task of disambiguating between entities with
different top-level categories under People by oc-
cupation.
 [S
2
] In a slight generalization of [S
1
], the set of
categories C
2
is restricted to all categories under
People by occupation. Each category must have at
least 200 articles to be retained,which results in a
total of 540 categories out of the 8202 categories
under People by occupation. The query dataset is
generated as in the first scenario by replacing C
1
with C
2
.
 [S
3
] This scenario is similar with [S
2
], except
that each category has to contain at least 20 arti-
cles to be retained, leading to 2847 out of 8202
categories.
 [S
4
] This scenario uses the same categories as
[S
2
] (i.e. C
4
=C
2
). In order to make the task more
realistic, all queries from the initial Wikipedia
dataset are considered as follows. For each query
q, out of all matching entities that do not have
a category under People by occupation, one is
randomly selected as an out-of-Wikipedia entity.
Then, out of all queries for which the true an-
swer is an out-of-Wikipedia entity, a subset is ran-
domly selected such that, in the end, the number of
queries with out-of-Wikipedia true answers is 10%
of the total number of queries. In other words, the
scenario assumes the task is to detect if a name
denotes an entity belonging to the People by occu-
pation taxonomy and, in the positive cases, to dis-
ambiguate between multiple entities under People
by occupation that have the same name.
The dataset for each scenario is split into a train-
ing dataset and a testing dataset which are dis-
joint in terms of the query names used in their
examples. For instance, if a query for the name
John Williams is included in the training dataset,
then all other queries with this name are allocated
for learning (and consequently excluded from test-
ing). Using a disjoint split is motivated by the fact
that many Wikipedia queries that have the same
true answer also have similar contexts, containing
rare words that are highly correlated, almost exclu-
sively, with the answer. For example, query names
that refer to singers often contain album or song
names, query names that refer to writers often con-
tain book names, etc. The taxonomy kernel can
easily ?memorize? these associations, especially
when the categories are very fine-grained. In the
current framework, the unsupervised method of
context-article similarity does not utilize the cor-
relations present in the training data. Therefore,
for the sake of comparison, we decided to prohibit
the taxonomy kernel from using these correlations
by training and testing on a disjoint split. Section 6
describes how the training queries could be used in
the computation of the context-article similarity,
which has the potential of boosting the accuracy
for both disambiguation methods.
Table 3 shows a number of relevant statistics
for each scenario: #CAT represents the number of
Wikipedia categories, #SV is the number of sup-
port vectors, TK(A) and Cos(A) are the accuracy
of the Taxonomy Kernel and the Cosine similar-
ity respectively. The training and testing datasets
are characterized in terms of the number of queries
and query-answer pairs. The number of ranking
contraints (as specified in Figure 2) is also in-
cluded for the training data in column #CONSTR.
The size of the training data is limited so that
learning in each scenario takes within three days
on a Pentium 4 CPU at 2.6 GHz. Furthermore,
15
in S
4
, the termination error criterion  is changed
from its default value of 0:001 to 0:01. Also, the
threshold  for detecting out-of-Wikipedia entities
when ranking with cosine similarity is set to the
value that gives highest accuracy on training data.
As can be seen in the last two columns, the Tax-
onomy Kernel significantly outperforms the Co-
sine similarity in the first three scenarios, con-
firming our intuition that correlations between
words from the query context and categories from
Wikipedia taxonomy provide useful information
for disambiguating named entities. In the last sce-
nario, which combines detection and disambigua-
tion, the gain is not that substantial. Most queries
in the corresponding dataset have only two possi-
ble answers, one of them an out-of-Wikipedia an-
swer, and for these cases the cosine is already do-
ing well at disambiguation. We conjecture that a
more significant impact would be observed if the
dataset queries were more ambiguous.
6 Future Work
The high number of support vectors ? half the
number of query-answer pairs in training data ?
suggests that all scenarios can benefit from more
training data. One method for making this feasible
is to use the weight vector w explicitely in a lin-
ear SVM. Because much of the computation time
is spent on evaluating the decision function, using
w explicitely may result in a significant speed-up.
The dimensionality of w (by default jV j  jCj)
can be reduced significantly by considering only
word-category pairs whose frequency in the train-
ing data is above a predefined threshold.
A complementary way of using the training data
is to augment the article of each named entity with
the contexts from all queries for which this entity
is the true answer. This method has the potential
of improving the accuracy of both methods when
the training and testing datasets are not disjoint in
terms of the proper names used in their queries.
Word-category correlations have been used in
(Ciaramita et al, 2003) to improve word sense dis-
ambiguation (WSD), although with less substan-
tial gains. There, a separate model was learned for
each of the 29 ambiguous nouns from the Sense-
val 2 lexical sample task. While creating a sepa-
rate model for each named entity is not feasible ?
there are 94,875 titles under People by occupation
? named entity disambiguation can nevertheless
benefit from correlations between Wikipedia cate-
gories and features traditionally used in WSD such
as bigrams and trigrams centered on the proper
name occurrence, and syntactic information.
7 Conclusion
We have presented a novel approach to named en-
tity detection and disambiguation that exploited
the untapped potential of an online encyclope-
dia. Experimental results show that using the
Wikipedia taxonomy leads to a substantial im-
provement in accuracy. The application of the new
named entity disambiguation method holds the
promise of better results to popular web searches.
