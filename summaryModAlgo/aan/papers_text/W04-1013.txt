Abstract 
ROUGE stands for Recall-Oriented Understudy for 
Gisting Evaluation. It includes measures to auto-
matically determine the quality of a summary by 
comparing it to other (ideal) summaries created by 
humans. The measures count the number of over-
lapping units such as n-gram, word sequences, and 
word pairs between the computer-generated sum-
mary to be evaluated and the ideal summaries cre-
ated by humans. This paper introduces four different 
ROUGE measures: ROUGE-N, ROUGE-L, ROUGE-W, 
and ROUGE-S included in the ROUGE summariza-
tion evaluation package and their evaluations. Three 
of them have been used in the Document Under-
standing Conference (DUC) 2004, a large-scale 
summarization evaluation sponsored by NIST. 
1 Introduction 
Traditionally evaluation of summarization involves 
human judgments of different quality metrics, for 
example, coherence, conciseness, grammaticality, 
readability, and content (Mani, 2001). However, 
even simple manual evaluation of summaries on a 
large scale over a few linguistic quality questions 
and content coverage as in the Document Under-
standing Conference (DUC) (Over and Yen, 2003) 
would require over 3,000 hours of human efforts. 
This is very expensive and difficult to conduct in a 
frequent basis. Therefore, how to evaluate summa-
ries automatically has drawn a lot of attention in the 
summarization research community in recent years. 
For example, Saggion et al (2002) proposed three 
content-based evaluation methods that measure 
similarity between summaries. These methods are: 
cosine similarity, unit overlap (i.e. unigram or bi-
gram), and longest common subsequence. However, 
they did not show how the results of these automatic 
evaluation methods correlate to human judgments. 
Following the successful application of automatic 
evaluation methods, such as BLEU (Papineni et al, 
2001), in machine translation evaluation, Lin and 
Hovy (2003) showed that methods similar to BLEU, 
i.e. n-gram co-occurrence statistics, could be applied 
to evaluate summaries. In this paper, we introduce a 
package, ROUGE, for automatic evaluation of sum-
maries and its evaluations. ROUGE stands for Re-
call-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation. It 
includes several automatic evaluation methods that 
measure the similarity between summaries. We de-
scribe ROUGE-N in Section 2, ROUGE-L in Section 
3, ROUGE-W in Section 4, and ROUGE-S in Section 
5. Section 6 shows how these measures correlate 
with human judgments using DUC 2001, 2002, and 
2003 data. Section 7 concludes this paper and dis-
cusses future directions. 
2 ROUGE-N: N-gram Co-Occurrence Statistics  
Formally, ROUGE-N is an n-gram recall between a 
candidate summary and a set of reference summa-
ries. ROUGE-N is computed as follows:

Where n stands for the length of the n-gram, 
gramn, and Countmatch(gramn) is the maximum num-
ber of n-grams co-occurring in a candidate summary 
and a set of reference summaries.  
It is clear that ROUGE-N is a recall-related meas-
ure because the denominator of the equation is the 
total sum of the number of n-grams occurring at the 
reference summary side. A closely related measure, 
BLEU, used in automatic evaluation of machine 
translation, is a precision-based measure. BLEU 
measures how well a candidate translation matches 
a set of reference translations by counting the per-
centage of n-grams in the candidate translation over-
lapping with the references. Please see Papineni et 
al. (2001) for details about BLEU. 
Note that the number of n-grams in the denomina-
tor of the ROUGE-N formula increases as we add 
more references. This is intuitive and reasonable 
because there might exist multiple good summaries. 
Every time we add a reference into the pool, we ex-
pand the space of alternative summaries. By con-
trolling what types of references we add to the 
reference pool, we can design evaluations that focus 
on different aspects of summarization. Also note 
that the numerator sums over all reference summa-
ries. This effectively gives more weight to matching 
n-grams occurring in multiple references. Therefore 
a candidate summary that contains words shared by 
more references is favored by the ROUGE-N meas-
ure. This is again very intuitive and reasonable be-
cause we normally prefer a candidate summary that 
is more similar to consensus among reference sum-
maries. 
2.1 Multiple References 
So far, we only demonstrated how to compute 
ROUGE-N using a single reference. When multiple 
references are used, we compute pairwise summary-
level ROUGE-N between a candidate summary s and 
every reference, ri, in the reference set. We then 
take the maximum of pairwise summary-level 
ROUGE-N scores as the final multiple reference 
ROUGE-N score. This can be written as follows: 
 
ROUGE-Nmulti  = argmaxi ROUGE-N(ri,s)  
 
This procedure is also applied to computation of 
ROUGE-L (Section 3), ROUGE-W (Section 4) , and 
ROUGE-S (Section 5). In the implementation, we use 
a Jackknifing procedure. Given M references, we 
compute the best score over M sets of M-1 refer-
ences. The final ROUGE-N score is the average of 
the M ROUGE-N scores using different M-1 refer-
ences.  The Jackknifing procedure is adopted since 
we often need to compare system and human per-
formance and the reference summaries are usually 
the only human summaries available. Using this 
procedure, we are able to estimate average human 
performance by averaging M ROUGE-N scores of 
one reference vs. the rest M-1 references. Although 
the Jackknif ing procedure is not necessary when we 
just want to compute ROUGE scores using multiple 
references, it is applied in all ROUGE score compu-
tations in the ROUGE evaluation package. 
In the next section, we describe a ROUGE measure 
based on longest common subsequences between 
two summaries. 
3 ROUGE-L: Longest Common Subsequence  
A sequence Z = [z1, z2, ..., zn] is a subsequence of 
another sequence X = [x1, x2, ..., xm], if there exists a 
strict increasing sequence [i1, i2, ..., ik] of indices of 
X such that for all j = 1, 2, ..., k, we have xij = zj  
(Cormen et al, 1989). Given two sequences X and 
Y, the longest common subsequence (LCS) of X and 
Y is a common subsequence with maximum length. 
LCS has been used in identifying cognate candi-
dates during construction of N-best translation lexi-
con from parallel text. Melamed (1995) used the 
ratio (LCSR) between the length of the LCS of two 
words and the length of the longer word of the two 
words to measure the cognateness between them. 
He used LCS as an approximate string matching 
algorithm. Saggion et al (2002) used normalized 
pairwise LCS to compare simila rity between two 
texts in automatic summarization evaluation.  
3.1 Sentence-Level LCS 
To apply LCS in summarization evaluation, we 
view a summary sentence as a sequence of words. 
The intuition is that the longer the LCS of two 
summary sentences is, the more similar the two 
summaries are. We propose using LCS-based F-
measure to estimate the similarity between two 
summaries X of length m and Y of length n, assum-
ing X is a reference summary sentence and Y is a 
candidate summary sentence, as follows: 
 
Rlcs 
m
YXLCS ),(=       (2) 
Plcs 
n
YXLCS ),(=       (3) 
Flcs  
lcslcs
lcslcs

Where LCS(X,Y) is the length of a longest com-
mon subsequence of X and Y, and ? = Plcs/Rlcs when 
?Flcs/?Rlcs_=_?Flcs/?Plcs.  In DUC, ? is set to a very 
big number (?  8 ). Therefore, only Rlcs is consid-
ered. We call the LCS-based F-measure, i.e. Equa-
tion 4, ROUGE-L. Notice that ROUGE-L is 1 when X 
= Y; while ROUGE-L is zero when LCS(X,Y) = 0, i.e. 
there is nothing in common between X and Y. F-
measure or its equivalents has been shown to have 
met several theoretical criteria in measuring accu-
racy involving more than one factor (Van Rijsber-
gen, 1979). The composite factors are LCS-based 
recall and precision in this case. Melamed et al 
(2003) used unigram F-measure to estimate machine 
translation quality and showed that unigram F-
measure was as good as BLEU.  
One advantage of using LCS is that it does not re-
quire consecutive matches but in-sequence matches 
that reflect sentence level word order as n-grams. 
The other advantage is that it automatically includes 
longest in-sequence common n-grams, therefore no 
predefined n-gram length is necessary.  
ROUGE-L as defined in Equation 4 has the prop-
erty that its value is less than or equal to the min i-
mum of unigram F-measure of X and Y. Unigram 
recall reflects the proportion of words in X (refer-
ence summary sentence) that are also present in Y 
(candidate summary sentence); while unigram pre-
cision is the proportion of words in Y that are also in 
X. Unigram recall and precision count all co-
occurring words regardless their orders; while 
ROUGE-L counts only in-sequence co-occurrences.  
By only awarding credit to in-sequence unigram 
matches, ROUGE-L also captures sentence level 
structure in a natural way. Consider the following 
example: 
 
S1. police killed the gunman 
S2. police kill the gunman 
S3. the gunman kill police 
 
We only consider ROUGE-2, i.e. N=2, for the pur-
pose of explanation. Using S1 as the reference and 
S2 and S3 as the candidate summary sentences, S2 
and S3 would have the same ROUGE-2 score, since 
they both have one bigram, i.e. ?the gunman?. How-
ever, S2 and S3 have very different meanings. In the 
case of ROUGE-L, S2 has a score of 3/4 = 0.75 and 
S3 has a score of 2/4 = 0.5, with ? = 1. Therefore S2 
is better than S3 according to ROUGE-L. This exam-
ple also illustrated that ROUGE-L can work reliably 
at sentence level. 
However, LCS suffers one disadvantage that it 
only counts the main in-sequence words; therefore, 
other alternative LCSes and shorter sequences are 
not reflected in the final score. For example, given 
the following candidate sentence: 
S4. the gunman police killed 
Using S1 as its reference, LCS counts either ?the 
gunman? or ?police killed?, but not both; therefore, 
S4 has the same ROUGE-L score as S3. ROUGE-2 
would prefer S4 than S3. 
3.2 Summary-Level LCS 
Previous section described how to compute sen-
tence-level LCS-based F-measure score. When ap-
plying to summary-level, we take the union LCS 
matches between a reference summary sentence, ri, 
and every candidate summary sentence, cj. Given a 
reference summary of u sentences containing a total 
of m words and a candidate summary of v sentences 
containing a total of n words, the summary-level 
LCS-based F-measure can be computed as follows: 
Rlcs m

Again ? is set to a very big number (?  8 ) in 
DUC, i.e. only Rlcs is considered. ),( CrLCS i? is the 
LCS score of the union longest common subse-
quence between reference sentence ri and candidate 
summary C. For example, if ri = w1 w2 w3 w4 w5, and 
C contains two sentences: c1 = w1 w2 w6 w7 w8 and c2 
= w1 w3 w8 w9 w5, then the longest common subse-
quence of ri and c1 is ?w1 w2? and the longest com-
mon subsequence of ri and c2 is ?w1 w3 w5?. The 
union longest common subsequence of ri, c1, and c2 
is ?w1 w2 w3 w5? and ),( CrLCS i? = 4/5. 
3.3 ROUGE-L vs. Normalized Pairwise LCS 
The normalized pairwise LCS proposed by Radev et 
al. (page 51, 2002) between two summaries S1 and 
S2, LCS(S1 ,S2)MEAD , is written as follows: 
 
? ?

Assuming S1 has m words and S2 has n words, 
Equation 8 can be rewritten as Equation 9 due to 
symmetry:

? ? ?1 2 ),(max*2                        (9) 
 
We then define MEAD LCS recall (Rlcs-MEAD) and 
MEAD LCS precision (Plcs-MEAD) as follows: 
 
 Rlcs-MEAD m

We can rewrite Equation (9) in terms of Rlcs-MEAD 
and Plcs-MEAD with a constant parameter ? = 1 as fol-
lows:

Equation 12 shows that normalized pairwise LCS 
as defined in Radev et al (2002) and implemented 
in MEAD is also a F-measure with ? = 1. Sentence-
level normalized pairwise LCS is the same as 
ROUGE-L with ? = 1. Besides setting ? = 1, sum-
mary-level normalized pairwise LCS is different 
from ROUGE-L in how a sentence gets its LCS score 
from its references. Normalized pairwise LCS takes 
the best LCS score while ROUGE-L takes the union 
LCS score. 
4 ROUGE-W: Weighted Longest Common Sub-
sequence 
LCS has many nice properties as we have described 
in the previous sections. Unfortunately, the basic 
LCS also has a problem that it does not differentiate 
LCSes of different spatial relations within their em-
bedding sequences. For example, given a reference 
sequence X and two candidate sequences Y1 and Y2 
as follows: 
 
X:  [A B C D E F G] 
Y1: [A B C D H I K] 
Y2:  [A H B K C I D] 
 
Y1 and Y2 have the same ROUGE-L score. How-
ever, in this case, Y1 should be the better choice than 
Y2 because Y1 has consecutive matches. To improve 
the basic LCS method, we can simply remember the 
length of consecutive matches encountered so far to 
a regular two dimensional dynamic program table 
computing LCS. We call this weighted LCS 
(WLCS) and use k to indicate the length of the cur-
rent consecutive matches ending at words xi and yj. 
Given two sentences X and Y, the WLCS score of X 
and Y can be computed using the following dynamic 
programming procedure: 
 
(1) For (i = 0; i <=m; i++) 
        c(i,j) = 0  // initialize c-table  
        w(i,j) = 0 // initialize w-table  
(2) For (i = 1; i <= m; i++) 
        For (j = 1; j <= n; j++) 
          If xi = yj Then 
     // the length of consecutive matches at 
     // position i-1 and j -1 
     k  = w(i-1,j-1) 
     c(i,j) = c(i-1,j-1) + f(k+1 ) ? f(k) 
     // remember the length of consecutive 
     // matches at position i, j  
     w(i,j) = k+1 
          Otherwise 
     If c(i-1,j) > c(i,j-1) Then 
    c(i,j) = c(i-1,j) 
    w(i,j) = 0           // no match at i, j 
     Else c(i,j) = c(i,j-1) 
     w(i,j) = 0           // no match at i, j 
(3) WLCS(X,Y) = c(m,n) 
 
Where c is the dynamic programming table, c(i,j) 
stores the WLCS score ending at word xi of X and yj 
of Y, w is the table storing the length of consecutive 
matches ended at c table position i and j, and f is a 
function of consecutive matches at the table posi-
tion, c(i,j). Notice that by providing different 
weighting function f, we can parameterize the 
WLCS algorithm to assign different credit to con-
secutive in-sequence matches.  
The weighting function f must have the property 
that f(x+y) > f(x) + f(y) for any positive integers x 
and y. In other words, consecutive matches are 
awarded more scores than non-consecutive matches. 
For example, f(k)-=-ak ? b when k >= 0, and a, b > 
0. This function charges a gap penalty of ?b for 
each non-consecutive n-gram sequences. Another 
possible function family is the polynomial family of 
the form ka where -a > 1. However, in order to 
normalize the final ROUGE-W score, we also prefer 
to have a function that has a close form inverse 
function. For example, f(k)-=-k2 has a close form 
inverse function f -1(k)-=-k1/2.  F-measure based on 
WLCS can be computed as follows, given two se-
quences X of length m and Y of length n:

Where f -1 is the inverse function of f. In DUC, ? is 
set to a very big number (?  8 ). Therefore, only 
Rwlcs is considered. We call the WLCS-based F-
measure, i.e. Equation 15, ROUGE-W. Using Equa-
tion 15 and f(k)-=-k2 as the weighting function, the 
ROUGE-W scores for sequences Y1 and Y2 are 0.571 
and 0.286 respectively. Therefore, Y1 would be 
ranked higher than Y2 using WLCS. We use the 
polynomial function of the form ka in the ROUGE 
evaluation package. In the next section, we intro-
duce the skip-bigram co-occurrence statistics. 
5 ROUGE-S: Skip-Bigram Co-Occurrence Sta-
tistics  
Skip-bigram is any pair of words in their sentence 
order, allowing for arbitrary gaps. Skip-bigram co-
occurrence statistics measure the overlap of skip-
bigrams between a candidate translation and a set of 
reference translations. Using the example given in 
Section 3.1: 
 
S1. police killed the gunman 
S2. police kill the gunman 
S3. the gunman kill police 
S4. the gunman police killed 
each sentence has C(4,2)1 = 6 skip-bigrams. For ex-
ample, S1 has the following skip-bigrams: 
(?police killed?, ?police the?, ?police gunman?, 
?killed the?, ?killed gunman?, ?the gunman?)  
S2 has three skip-bigram matches with S1 (?po-
lice the?, ?police gunman?, ?the gunman?), S3 has 
one skip-bigram match with S1 (?the gunman?), and 
S4 has two skip-bigram matches with S1 (?police 
killed?, ?the gunman?).  Given translations X of 
length m and Y of length n, assuming X is a refer-
ence translation and Y is a candidate translation, we 
compute skip-bigram-based F-measure as follows: 
Rskip2

Where SKIP2(X,Y) is the number of skip-bigram 
matches between X and Y, ? controlling the relative 
importance of Pskip2 and Rskip2, and  C is the combi-
nation function. We call the skip-bigram-based F-
measure, i.e. Equation 18, ROUGE-S. 
Using Equation 18 with ? = 1 and S1 as the refer-
ence, S2?s ROUGE-S score is 0.5, S3 is 0.167, and 
S4 is 0.333. Therefore, S2 is better than S3 and S4, 
and S4 is better than S3. This result is more intuitive 
than using BLEU-2 and ROUGE-L. One advantage of 
skip-bigram vs. BLEU is that it does not require con-
secutive matches but is still sensitive to word order. 
Comparing skip-bigram with LCS, skip-bigram 
counts all in-order matching word pairs while LCS 
only counts one longest common subsequence. 
Applying skip-bigram without any constraint on 
the distance between the words, spurious matches 
such as ?the the? or ?of in? might be counted as 
valid matches. To reduce these spurious matches, 
we can limit the maximum skip distance, dskip, be-
tween two in-order words that is allowed to form a 
skip-bigram. For example, if we set dskip to 0 then 
ROUGE-S is equivalent to bigram overlap F-
measure. If we set dskip to 4 then only word pairs of 
at most 4 words apart can form skip-bigrams. 
Adjusting Equations 16, 17, and 18 to use maxi-
mum skip distance limit is straightforward: we only 
count the skip-bigram matches, SKIP2 (X,Y), within 
the maximum skip distance and replace denomina-
tors of Equations 16, C(m,2), and 17, C(n,2), with 
the actual numbers of within distance skip-bigrams 
from the reference and the candidate respectively.  
 
                                                                 
1 C(4,2) = 4!/(2!*2!) = 6. 
5.1 ROUGE-SU: Extension of ROUGE-S 
One potential problem for ROUGE-S is that it does 
not give any credit to a candidate sentence if the 
sentence does not have any word pair co-occurring 
with its references. For example, the following sen-
tence has a ROUGE-S score of zero: 
 
S5. gunman the killed police 
 
S5 is the exact reverse of S1 and there is no skip 
bigram match between them. However, we would 
like to differentiate sentences similar to S5 from 
sentences that do not have single word co-
occurrence with S1. To achieve this, we extend 
ROUGE-S with the addition of unigram as counting 
unit. The extended version is called ROUGE-SU. We 
can also obtain ROUGE-SU from ROUGE-S by add-
ing a begin-of-sentence marker at the beginning of 
candidate and reference sentences. 
6 Evaluations of ROUGE 
To assess the effectiveness of ROUGE measures, we 
compute the correlation between ROUGE assigned 
summary scores and human assigned summary 
scores. The intuition is that a good evaluation meas-
ure should assign a good score to a good summary 
and a bad score to a bad summary. The ground truth 
is based on human assigned scores. Acquiring hu-
man judgments are usually very expensive; fortu-
nately, we have DUC 2001, 2002, and 2003 
evaluation data that include human judgments for 
the following: 
? Single document summaries of about 100 
words: 12 systems 2 for DUC 2001 and 14 sys-
tems for 2002. 149 single document summaries 
were judged per system in DUC 2001 and 295 
were judged in DUC 2002. 
? Single document very short summaries of about 
10 words (headline-like, keywords, or phrases): 
14 systems for DUC 2003. 624 very short sum-
maries were judged per system in DUC 2003. 
? Multi-document summaries of about 10 words: 
6 systems for DUC 2002; 50 words: 14 systems 
for DUC 2001 and 10 systems for DUC 2002; 
100 words: 14 systems for DUC 2001, 10 sys-
tems for DUC 2002, and 18 systems for DUC 
2003; 200 words: 14 systems for DUC 2001 and 
10 systems for DUC 2002; 400 words: 14 sys-
tems for DUC 2001. 29 summaries were judged 
per system per summary size in DUC 2001, 59 
were judged in DUC 2002, and 30 were judged 
in DUC 2003. 
                                                                 
2 All systems include 1 or 2 baselines. Please see DUC 
website for details. 
Besides these human judgments, we also have 3 sets 
of manual summaries for DUC 2001, 2 sets for 
DUC 2002, and 4 sets for DUC 2003. Human 
judges assigned content coverage scores to a candi-
date summary by examining the percentage of con-
tent overlap between a manual summary unit, i.e. 
elementary discourse unit or sentence, and the can-
didate summary using Summary Evaluation Envi-
ronment3 (SEE) developed by  the University of 
Southern California?s Information Sciences Institute 
(ISI). The overall candidate summary score is the 
average of the content coverage scores of all the 
units in the manual summary. Note that human 
judges used only one manual summary in all the 
evaluations although multiple alternative summaries 
were available. 
With the DUC data, we computed Pearson?s 
product moment correlation coefficients, Spear-
man?s rank order correlation coefficients, and 
Kendall?s correlation coefficients between systems? 
average ROUGE scores and their human assigned 
average coverage scores using single reference and 
multiple references. To investigate the effect of

manual summaries (CASE set), stemmed4 version of 
the summaries (STEM set), and stopped version of 
the summaries (STOP set). For example, we com-
puted ROUGE scores for the 12 systems participated 
in the DUC 2001 single document summarization 
evaluation using the CASE set with single reference 
and then calculated the three correlation scores for 
these 12 systems? ROUGE scores vs. human assigned 
average coverage scores. After that we repeated the 
process using multiple references and then using 
STEM and STOP sets. Therefore, 2 (multi or single) 
x 3 (CASE, STEM, or STOP) x 3 (Pearson, Spear-
man, or Kendall) = 18 data points were collected for 
each ROUGE measure and each DUC task. To assess 
the significance of the results, we applied bootstrap 
resampling technique (Davison and Hinkley, 1997) 
to estimate 95% confidence intervals for every cor-
relation computation. 
17 ROUGE measures were tested for each run us-
ing ROUGE evaluation package v1.2.1: ROUGE-N  
with N = 1 to 9, ROUGE-L, ROUGE-W with 
weighting factor a  = 1.2, ROUGE-S and ROUGE-SU 
with maximum skip distance dskip = 1, 4, and 9. Due 
to limitation of space, we only report correlation 
analysis results based on Pearson?s correlation coef-
ficient. Correlation analyses based on Spearman?s 
and Kendall?s correlation coefficients are tracking 
Pearson?s very closely and will be posted later at the 
ROUGE website5 for reference. The critical value6 
for Pearson?s correlation is 0.632 at 95% confidence 
with 8 degrees of freedom. 
Table 1 shows the Pearson?s correlation coeffi-
cients of the 17 ROUGE measures vs. human judg-
ments on DUC 2001 and 2002 100 words single 
document summarization data. The best values in 
each column are marked with dark (green) color and 
statistically equivalent values to the best values are 
marked with gray. We found that correlations were 
not affected by stemming or removal of stopwords 
in this data set, ROUGE-2 performed better among 
the ROUGE-N variants, ROUGE-L, ROUGE-W, and 
ROUGE-S were all performing well, and using mul-
tiple references improved performance though not 
much. All ROUGE measures achieved very good 
correlation with human judgments in the DUC 2002 
data. This might due to the double sample size in 
DUC 2002 (295 vs. 149 in DUC 2001) for each sys-
tem. 
Table 2 shows the correlation analysis results on 
the DUC 2003 single document very short summary 
data. We found that ROUGE-1, ROUGE-L, ROUGE-

Table 2: Pearson?s correlations of 17 ROUGE
measure scores vs. human judgments for the DUC 
2003 very short summary task 
SU4 and 9, and ROUGE-W were very good measures 
in this category, ROUGE-N with N > 1 performed 
significantly worse than all other measures, and ex-
clusion of stopwords improved performance in gen-
eral except for ROUGE-1. Due to the large number 
of samples (624) in this data set, using multiple ref-
erences did not improve correlations. 
In Table 3 A1, A2, and A3, we show correlation 
analysis results on DUC 2001, 2002, and 2003 100 
words multi-document summarization data. The 
results indicated that using multiple references im-
proved correlation and exclusion of stopwords usu-
ally improved performance. ROUGE-1, 2, and 3 
performed fine but were not consistent. ROUGE-1, 
ROUGE-S4, ROUGE-SU4, ROUGE-S9, and ROUGE-
SU9 with stopword removal had correlation above 
0.70. ROUGE-L and ROUGE-W did not work well in 
this set of data. 
Table 3 C, D1, D2, E1, E2, and F show the corre-
lation analyses using multiple references on the rest 
of DUC data. These results again suggested that 
exclusion of stopwords achieved better performance 
especially in multi-document summaries of 50 
words. Better correlations (> 0.70) were observed 
on long summary tasks, i.e. 200 and 400 words 
summaries. The relative performance of ROUGE 
measures followed the pattern of the 100 words 
multi-document summarization task. 
Comparing the results in Table 3 with Tables 1 
and 2, we found that correlation values in the multi-
document tasks rarely reached high 90% except in 
long summary tasks. One possible explanation of 
this outcome is that we did not have large amount of 
samples for the multi-document tasks. In the single 
document summarization tasks we had over 100 
samples; while we only had about 30 samples in the 
multi-document tasks. The only tasks that had over 
30 samples was from DUC 2002 and the correla-
tions of ROUGE measures with human judgments on 
the 100 words summary task were much better and 
more stable than similar tasks in DUC 2001 and 
2003. Statistically stable human judgments of sys-
tem performance might not be obtained due to lack 
of samples and this in turn caused instability of cor-
relation analyses. 
7 Conclusions  
In this paper, we introduced ROUGE, an automatic 
evaluation package for summarization, and con-
ducted comprehensive evaluations of the automatic 
measures included in the ROUGE package using 
three years of DUC data. To check the significance 
of the results, we estimated confidence intervals of 
correlations using bootstrap resampling. We found 
that (1) ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, ROUGE-W, and 
ROUGE-S worked well in single document summa-
rization tasks, (2) ROUGE-1, ROUGE-L, ROUGE-W, 
ROUGE-SU4, and ROUGE-SU9 performed great in 
evaluating very short summaries (or headline-like 
summaries), (3) correlation of high 90% was hard to 
achieve for multi-document summarization tasks but 
ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-S4, ROUGE-S9, 
ROUGE-SU4, and ROUGE-SU9 worked reasonably 
well when stopwords were excluded from matching, 
(4) exclusion of  stopwords usually improved corre-
lation, and (5) correlations to human judgments 
were increased by using multiple references. 
In summary, we showed that the ROUGE package 
could be used effectively in automatic evaluation of 
summaries. In a separate study (Lin and Och, 2004),

Table 3: Pearson?s correlations of 17 ROUGE measure scores vs. human judgments for 
the DUC 2001, 2002, and 2003 mult i-document summarization tasks  
ROUGE-L, W, and S were also shown to be very 
effective in automatic  evaluation of machine 
translation. The stability and reliability of ROUGE at 
different sample sizes was reported by the author in 
(Lin, 2004). However, how to achieve high correla-
tion with human judgments in multi-document 
summarization tasks as ROUGE already did in single 
document summarization tasks is still an open re-
search topic.
