Abstract
This paper presents the task definition, resources,
participating systems, and comparative results for a
Romanian Word Sense Disambiguation task, which
was organized as part of the SENSEVAL-3 evaluation
exercise. Five teams with a total of seven systems
were drawn to this task.
1 Introduction
SENSEVAL is an evaluation exercise of the lat-
est word-sense disambiguation (WSD) systems. It
serves as a forum that brings together researchers in
WSD and domains that use WSD for various tasks.
It allows researchers to discuss modifications that
improve the performance of their systems, and an-
alyze combinations that are optimal.
Since the first edition of the SENSEVAL competi-
tions, a number of languages were added to the orig-
inal set of tasks. Having the WSD task prepared for
several languages provides the opportunity to test
the generality of WSD systems, and to detect dif-
ferences with respect to word senses in various lan-
guages.
This year we have proposed a Romanian WSD
task. Five teams with a total of seven systems have
tackled this task. We present in this paper the data
used and how it was obtained, and the performance
of the participating systems.
2 Open Mind Word Expert
The sense annotated corpus required for this task
was built using the Open Mind Word Expert system
(Chklovski and Mihalcea, 2002), adapted to Roma-
nian1.
To overcome the current lack of sense tagged
data and the limitations imposed by the creation of
such data using trained lexicographers, the Open
Mind Word Expert system enables the collection
of semantically annotated corpora over the Web.
Sense tagged examples are collected using a Web-
based application that allows contributors to anno-
tate words with their meanings.
The tagging exercise proceeds as follows. For
each target word the system extracts a set of sen-
tences from a large textual corpus. These examples
are presented to the contributors, who are asked to
select the most appropriate sense for the target word
in each sentence. The selection is made using check-
boxes, which list all possible senses of the current
target word, plus two additional choices, ?unclear?
and ?none of the above.? Although users are en-
couraged to select only one meaning per word, the
selection of two or more senses is also possible. The
results of the classification submitted by other users
are not presented to avoid artificial biases.
3 Sense inventory
For the Romanian WSD task, we have chosen a set
of words from three parts of speech - nouns, verbs
and adjectives. Table 1 presents the number of
words under each part of speech, and the average
number of senses for each class.
The senses were (manually) extracted from a Ro-
manian dictionary (Dict?ionarul EXplicativ al limbii
roma?ne - DEX (Coteanu et al, 1975)). These senses

Table 1: Sense inventory
and their dictionary definitions were incorporated in
the Open Mind Word Expert. For each annotation
task, the contributors could choose from this list of
39 words. For each chosen word, the system dis-
plays the associated senses, together with their def-
initions, and a short (1-4 words) description of the
sense. After the user gets familiarized with these
senses, the system displays each example sentence,
and the list of senses together with their short de-
scription, to facilitate the tagging process.
For the coarse grained WSD task, we had the op-
tion of using the grouping provided by the dictio-
nary. A manual analysis however showed that some
of the senses in the same group are quite distinguish-
able, while others that were separated were very
similar.
For example, for the word circulatie (roughly, cir-
culation). The following two senses are grouped in
the dictionary:
2a. movement, travel along a communication
line/way
2b. movement of the sap in plants or the cytoplasm
inside cells
Sense 2a fits better with sense 1 of circulation:
1. the event of moving about
while sense 2b fits better with sense 3:
3. movement or flow of a liquid, gas, etc. within a
circuit or pipe.
To obtain a better grouping, a linguist clustered
the similar senses for each word in our list of forty.
The average number of senses for each class is al-
most halved.
Notice that Romanian is a language that uses dia-
critics, and the the presence of diacritics may be cru-
cial for distinguishing between words. For example
peste without diacritics may mean fish or over. In
choosing the list of words for the Romanian WSD
task, we have tried to avoid such situations. Al-
though some of the words in the list do have dia-
critics, omitting them does not introduce new ambi-
guities.
4 Corpus
Examples are extracted from the ROCO corpus, a
400 million words corpus consisting of a collection
of Romanian newspapers collected on the Web over
a three years period (1999-2002).
The corpus was tokenized and part-of-speech
tagged using RACAI?s tools (Tufis, 1999). The to-
kenizer recognizes and adequately segments various
constructs: clitics, dates, abbreviations, multiword
expressions, proper nouns, etc. The tagging fol-
lowed the tiered tagging approach with the hidden
layer of tagging being taken care of by Thorsten
Brants? TNT (Brants, 2000). The upper level of
the tiered tagger removed from the assigned tags all
the attributes irrelevant for this WSD exercise. The
estimated accuracy of the part-of-speech tagging is
around 98%.
5 Sense Tagged Data
While several sense annotation schemes have been
previously proposed, including single or dual anno-
tations, or the ?tag until two agree? scheme used dur-
ing SENSEVAL-2, we decided to use a new scheme
and collect four tags per item, which allowed us
to conduct and compare inter-annotator agreement
evaluations for two-, three-, and four-way agree-
ment. The agreement rates are listed in Table 3.
The two-way agreement is very high ? above 90%
? and these are the items that we used to build the
annotated data set. Not surprisingly, four-way agree-
ment is reached for a significantly smaller number of
cases. While these items with four-way agreement
were not explicitly used in the current evaluation,
we believe that this represents a ?platinum standard?
data set with no precedent in the WSD research com-
munity, which may turn useful for a range of future
experiments (for bootstrapping, in particular).

At least two agree 10,890 94.43%
At least three agree 8,192 71.03%

together with their most common English transla-
tions. For each word, we also list the number of
senses, as defined in the DEX sense inventory (col-
locations included), and the number of annotated ex-
amples made available to task participants.

Table 4: Teams participating in the SENSEVAL-3 Romanian Word Sense Disambiguation task
In addition to sense annotated examples, partici-
pants have been also provided with a large number
of unlabeled examples. However, among all partici-
pating systems, only one system ? described in (Ser-
ban and Ta?tar 2004) ? attempted to integrate this ad-
ditional unlabeled data set into the learning process.
6 Participating Systems
Five teams participated in this word sense disam-
biguation task. Table 4 lists the names of the par-
ticipating systems, the corresponding institutions,
and references to papers in this volume that provide
detailed descriptions of the systems and additional
analysis of their results.
There were no restrictions placed on the number
of submissions each team could make. A total num-
ber of seven submissions was received for this task.
Table 5 shows all the submissions for each team, and
gives a brief description of their approaches.
7 Results and Discussion
Table 6 lists the results obtained by all participating
systems, and the baseline obtained using the ?most
frequent sense? (MFS) heuristic. The table lists pre-
cision and recall figures for both fine grained and
coarse grained scoring.
The performance of all systems is significantly
higher than the baseline, with the best system per-
forming at 72.7% (77.1%) for fine grained (coarse
grained) scoring, which represents a 35% (38%) er-
ror reduction with respect to the baseline.
The best system (romanian-swat hk-bo) relies on
a Maximum Entropy classifier with boosting, using
local context (neighboring words, lemmas, and their
part of speech), as well as bag-of-words features for
surrounding words.
Not surprisingly, several of the top perform-
ing systems are based on combinations of multi-
ple sclassifiers, which shows once again that voting

8 Conclusion
A Romanian Word Sense Disambiguation task
was organized as part of the SENSEVAL-3 eval-
uation exercise. In this paper, we presented
the task definition, and resources involved, and
shortly described the participating systems. The
task drew the participation of five teams, and in-
cluded seven different systems. The sense an-
notated data used in this exercise is available
online from http://www.senseval.org and
http://teach-computers.org.
