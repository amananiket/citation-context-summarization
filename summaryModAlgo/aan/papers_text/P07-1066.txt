Abstract
We propose a novel approach to crosslingual
language model (LM) adaptation based on
bilingual Latent Semantic Analysis (bLSA).
A bLSA model is introduced which enables
latent topic distributions to be efficiently
transferred across languages by enforcing
a one-to-one topic correspondence during
training. Using the proposed bLSA frame-
work crosslingual LM adaptation can be per-
formed by, first, inferring the topic poste-
rior distribution of the source text and then
applying the inferred distribution to the tar-
get language N-gram LM via marginal adap-
tation. The proposed framework also en-
ables rapid bootstrapping of LSA models
for new languages based on a source LSA
model from another language. On Chinese
to English speech and text translation the
proposed bLSA framework successfully re-
duced word perplexity of the English LM by
over 27% for a unigram LM and up to 13.6%
for a 4-gram LM. Furthermore, the pro-
posed approach consistently improved ma-
chine translation quality on both speech and
text based adaptation.
1 Introduction
Language model adaptation is crucial to numerous
speech and translation tasks as it enables higher-
level contextual information to be effectively incor-
porated into a background LM improving recogni-
tion or translation performance. One approach is
to employ Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) to cap-
ture in-domain word unigram distributions which
are then integrated into the background N-gram
LM. This approach has been successfully applied
in automatic speech recognition (ASR) (Tam and
Schultz, 2006) using the Latent Dirichlet Alloca-
tion (LDA) (Blei et al, 2003). The LDA model can
be viewed as a Bayesian topic mixture model with
the topic mixture weights drawn from a Dirichlet
distribution. For LM adaptation, the topic mixture
weights are estimated based on in-domain adapta-
tion text (e.g. ASR hypotheses). The adapted mix-
ture weights are then used to interpolate a topic-
dependent unigram LM, which is finally integrated
into the background N-gram LM using marginal
adaptation (Kneser et al, 1997)
In this paper, we propose a framework to per-
form LM adaptation across languages, enabling the
adaptation of a LM from one language based on the
adaptation text of another language. In statistical
machine translation (SMT), one approach is to ap-
ply LM adaptation on the target language based on
an initial translation of input references (Kim and
Khudanpur, 2003; Paulik et al, 2005). This scheme
is limited by the coverage of the translation model,
and overall by the quality of translation. Since this
approach only allows to apply LM adaptation af-
ter translation, available knowledge cannot be ap-
plied to extend the coverage. We propose a bilingual
LSA model (bLSA) for crosslingual LM adaptation
that can be applied before translation. The bLSA
model consists of two LSA models: one for each
side of the language trained on parallel document
corpora. The key property of the bLSA model is that
520
the latent topic of the source and target LSA mod-
els can be assumed to be a one-to-one correspon-
dence and thus share a common latent topic space
since the training corpora consist of bilingual paral-
lel data. For instance, say topic 10 of the Chinese
LSA model is about politics. Then topic 10 of the
English LSA model is set to also correspond to pol-
itics and so forth. During LM adaptation, we first
infer the topic mixture weights from the source text
using the source LSA model. Then we transfer the
inferred mixture weights to the target LSA model
and thus obtain the target LSA marginals. The chal-
lenge is to enforce the one-to-one topic correspon-
dence. Our proposal is to share common variational
Dirichlet posteriors over the topic mixture weights
of a document pair in the LDA-style model. The
beauty of the bLSA framework is that the model
searches for a common latent topic space in an un-
supervised fashion, rather than to require manual in-
teraction. Since the topic space is language indepen-
dent, our approach supports topic transfer in multi-
ple language pairs in O(N) where N is the number of
languages.
Related work includes the Bilingual Topic Ad-
mixture Model (BiTAM) for word alignment pro-
posed by (Zhao and Xing, 2006). Basically, the
BiTAM model consists of topic-dependent transla-
tion lexicons modeling Pr(c|e, k) where c, e and
k denotes the source Chinese word, target English
word and the topic index respectively. On the
other hand, the bLSA framework models Pr(c|k)
and Pr(e|k) which is different from the BiTAM
model. By their different modeling nature, the bLSA
model usually supports more topics than the BiTAM
model. Another work by (Kim and Khudanpur,
2004) employed crosslingual LSA using singular
value decomposition which concatenates bilingual
documents into a single input supervector before
projection.
We organize the paper as follows: In Section 2,
we introduce the bLSA framework including La-
tent Dirichlet-Tree Allocation (LDTA) (Tam and
Schultz, 2007) as a correlated LSA model, bLSA
training and crosslingual LM adaptation. In Sec-
tion 3, we present the effect of LM adaptation on
word perplexity, followed by SMT experiments re-
ported in BLEU on both speech and text input in
Section 3.3. Section 4 describes conclusions and fu-

2 Bilingual Latent Semantic Analysis
The goal of a bLSA model is to enforce a one-
to-one topic correspondence between monolingual
LSA models, each of which can be modeled using
an LDA-style model. The role of the bLSA model
is to transfer the inferred latent topic distribution
from the source language to the target language as-
suming that the topic distributions on both sides are
identical. The assumption is reasonable for parallel
document pairs which are faithful translations. Fig-
ure 1 illustrates the idea of topic transfer between
monolingual LSA models followed by LM adapta-
tion. One observation is that the topic transfer can be
bi-directional meaning that the ?flow? of topic can
be from ASR to SMT or vice versa. In this paper,
we only focus on ASR-to-SMT direction. Our tar-
get is to minimize the word perplexity on the target
language through LM adaptation. Before we intro-
duce the heuristic of enforcing a one-to-one topic
correspondence, we describe the Latent Dirichlet-
Tree Allocation (LDTA) for LSA.
2.1 Latent Dirichlet-Tree Allocation
The LDTA model extends the LDA model in which
correlation among latent topics are captured using a
Dirichlet-Tree prior. Figure 2 illustrates a depth-two
Dirichlet-Tree. A tree of depth one simply falls back
to the LDA model. The LDTA model is a generative
model with the following generative process:
1. Sample a vector of branch probabilities bj ?
521
Dir(.)Dir(.) Dir(.)
Dir(.)
topic 1 topic 4Latent topics topic K
j=1
j=2 j=3
Figure 2: Dirichlet-Tree prior of depth two.
Dir(?j) for each node j = 1...J where ?j de-
notes the parameter (aka the pseudo-counts of
its outgoing branches) of the Dirichlet distribu-
tion at node j.
2. Compute the topic proportions as:
?k =
?
jc
b?jc(k)jc (1)
where ?jc(k) is an indicator function which sets
to unity when the c-th branch of the j-th node
leads to the leaf node of topic k and zero other-
wise. The k-th topic proportion ?k is computed
as the product of branch probabilities from the
root node to the leaf node of topic k.
3. Generate a document using the topic multino-
mial for each word wi:
zi ? Mult(?)
wi ? Mult(?.zi)
where ?.zi denotes the topic-dependent uni-
gram LM indexed by zi.
The joint distribution of the latent variables (topic
sequence zn1 and the Dirichlet nodes over child
branches bj) and an observed document wn1 can be
written as follows:
p(wn1 , zn1 , bJ1 ) = p(bJ1 |{?j})
n
?
i
?wizi ? ?zi
where p(bJ1 |{?j}) =
J
?
j
Dir(bj;?j)
?
?
jc
b?jc?1jc
Similar to LDA training, we apply the variational
Bayes approach by optimizing the lower bound of
the marginalized document likelihood:
L(wn1 ; ?,?)=Eq[log
p(wn1 , zn1 , bJ1 ; ?)
q(zn1 , bJ1 ; ?)
]
=Eq[log p(wn1 |zn1 )] + Eq[log
p(zn1 |bJ1 )
q(zn1 )

+Eq[log
p(bJ1 ; {?j})
q(bJ1 ; {?j})

where q(zn1 , bJ1 ; ?) =
?n
i q(zi) ?
?J
j q(bj) is a fac-
torizable variational posterior distribution over the
latent variables parameterized by ? which are deter-
mined in the E-step. ? is the model parameters for
a Dirichlet-Tree {?j} and the topic-dependent uni-
gram LM {?wk}. The LDTA model has an E-step
similar to the LDA model:
E-Step:
?jc = ?jc +
n

qik ? ?jc(k) (2)
qik ? ?wik ? eEq[log ?k] (3)

?jc(k)Eq[log bjc]
=
?
jc
?jc(k)
(
?(?jc)??(
?
c

)
where qik denotes q(zi = k) meaning the variational
topic posterior of word wi. Eqn 2 and Eqn 3 are
executed iteratively until convergence is reached.
M-Step:
?wk ?
n
?
i
qik ? ?(wi, w) (4)
where ?(wi, w) is a Kronecker Delta function. The
alpha parameters can be estimated with iterative
methods such as Newton-Raphson or simple gradi-
ent ascent procedure.
2.2 Bilingual LSA training
For the following explanations, we assume that our
source and target languages are Chinese and En-
glish respectively. The bLSA model training is a
522
two-stage procedure. At the first stage, we train
a Chinese LSA model using the Chinese docu-
ments in parallel corpora. We applied the varia-
tional EM algorithm (Eqn 2?4) to train a Chinese
LSA model. Then we used the model to compute
the term eEq[log ?k] needed in Eqn 3 for each Chinese
document in parallel corpora. At the second stage,
we apply the same eEq [log ?k] to bootstrap an English
LSA model, which is the key to enforce a one-to-one
topic correspondence. Now the hyper-parameters of
the variational Dirichlet posteriors of each node in
the Dirichlet-Tree are shared among the Chinese and
English model. Precisely, we apply only Eqn 3 with
fixed eEq [log ?k] in the E-step and Eqn 4 in the M-step
on {?wk} to bootstrap an English LSA model. No-
tice that the E-step is non-iterative resulting in rapid
LSA training. In short, given a monolingual LSA
model, we can rapidly bootstrap LSA models of new
languages using parallel document corpora. Notice
that the English and Chinese vocabulary sizes do not
need to be similar. In our setup, the Chinese vo-
cabulary comes from the ASR system while the En-
glish vocabulary comes from the English part of the
parallel corpora. Since the topic transfer can be bi-
directional, we can perform the bLSA training in a
reverse manner, i.e. training an English LSA model
followed by bootstrapping a Chinese LSA model.
2.3 Crosslingual LM adaptation
Given a source text, we apply the E-step to estimate
variational Dirichlet posterior of each node in the
Dirichlet-Tree. We estimate the topic weights on the
source language using the following equation:
??(CH)k ?
?
jc
(
?jc
?
c? ?jc?
)?jc(k)
(5)
Then we apply the topic weights into the target LSA
model to obtain an in-domain LSA marginals:
PrEN (w) =
K
?
k=1
?(EN)wk ? ??
(CH)
k (6)
We integrate the LSA marginal into the target back-
ground LM using marginal adaptation (Kneser et al,
1997) which minimizes the Kullback-Leibler diver-
gence between the adapted LM and the background
LM:
Pra(w|h) ?
(
Prldta(w)
Prbg(w)
)?
? Prbg(w|h) (7)
Likewise, LM adaptation can take place on the
source language as well due to the bi-directional na-
ture of the bLSA framework when target-side adap-
tation text is available. In this paper, we focus on
LM adaptation on the target language for SMT.
3 Experimental Setup
We evaluated our bLSA model using the Chinese?
English parallel document corpora consisting of the
Xinhua news, Hong Kong news and Sina news. The
combined corpora contains 67k parallel documents
with 35M Chinese (CH) words and 43M English
(EN) words. Our spoken language translation sys-
tem translates from Chinese to English. The Chinese
vocabulary comes from the ASR decoder while the
English vocabulary is derived from the English por-
tion of the parallel training corpora. The vocabulary
sizes for Chinese and English are 108k and 69k re-
spectively. Our background English LM is a 4-gram
LM trained with the modified Kneser-Ney smooth-
ing scheme using the SRILM toolkit on the same
training text. We explore the bLSA training in both
directions: EN?CH and CH?EN meaning that an
English LSA model is trained first and a Chinese
LSA model is bootstrapped or vice versa. Exper-
iments explore which bootstrapping direction yield
best results measured in terms of English word per-
plexity. The number of latent topics is set to 200 and
a balanced binary Dirichlet-Tree prior is used.
With an increasing interest in the ASR-SMT cou-
pling for spoken language translation, we also eval-
uated our approach with Chinese ASR hypotheses
and compared with Chinese manual transcriptions.
We are interested to see the impact due to recog-
nition errors on the ASR hypotheses compared to
the manual transcriptions. We employed the CMU-
InterACT ASR system developed for the GALE
2006 evaluation. We trained acoustic models with
over 500 hours of quickly transcribed speech data re-
leased by the GALE program and the LM with over
800M-word Chinese corpora. The character error
rates on the CCTV, RFA and NTDTV shows in the
RT04 test set are 7.4%, 25.5% and 13.1% respec-
tively.

3.1 Analysis of the bLSA model
By examining the top-words of the extracted paral-
lel topics, we verify the validity of the heuristic de-
scribed in Section 2.2 which enforces a one-to-one
topic correspondence in the bLSA model. Table 1
shows the latent topics extracted by the CH?EN
bLSA model. We can see that the Chinese-English
topic words have strong correlations. Many of them
are actually translation pairs with similar word rank-
ings. From this viewpoint, we can interpret bLSA as
a crosslingual word trigger model. The result indi-
cates that our heuristic is effective to extract parallel
latent topics. As a sanity check, we also examine the
likelihood of the training data when an English LSA
model is bootstrapped. We can see from Figure 3
that the likelihood increases monotonically with the
number of training iterations. The figure also shows
that by sharing the variational Dirichlet posteriors
from the Chinese LSA model, we can bootstrap an
English LSA model rapidly compared to monolin-
gual English LSA training with both training proce-
dures started from the same flat model.

3.2 LM adaptation results
We trained the bLSA models on both CH?EN and
EN?CH directions and compared their LM adapta-
tion performance using the Chinese ASR hypothe-
ses (hypo) and the manual transcriptions (ref) as in-
put. We adapted the English background LM using
the LSA marginals described in Section 2.3 for each
show on the test set.
We first evaluated the English word perplexity us-
ing the EN unigram LM generated by the bLSA
model. Table 2 shows that the bLSA-based LM
adaptation reduces the word perplexity by over 27%
relative compared to an unadapted EN unigram LM.
The results indicate that the bLSA model success-
fully leverages the text from the source language and
improves the word perplexity on the target language.
We observe that there is almost no performance dif-
ference when either the ASR hypotheses or the man-
ual transcriptions are used for adaptation. The result
is encouraging since the bLSA model may be in-
sensitive to moderate recognition errors through the
projection of the input adaptation text into the latent
topic space. We also apply an English translation
reference for adaptation to show an oracle perfor-
mance. The results using the Chinese hypotheses are
not too far off from the oracle performance. Another
observation is that the CH?EN bLSA model seems
to give better performance than the EN?CH bLSA
model. However, their differences are not signifi-
cant. The result may imply that the direction of the
bLSA training is not important since the latent topic
space captured by either language is similar when
parallel training corpora are used. Table 3 shows the
word perplexity when the background 4-gram En-
glish LM is adapted with the tuning parameter ? set

using the ASR hypotheses or the manual transcrip-
tions are almost identical on different ? with an op-
timal value at around 0.7. The results show that the
proposed approach successfully reduces the perplex-
ity in the range of 9?13.6% relative compared to an
unadapted baseline on different shows when ASR
hypotheses are used. Moreover, we observe simi-
lar performance using ASR hypotheses or manual
Chinese transcriptions which is consistent with the
results on Table 2. On the other hand, it is interest-
ing to see that the performance gap from the oracle
adaptation is somewhat related to the degree of mis-
match between the test show and the training condi-
tion. The gap looks wider on the RFA and NTDTV
shows compared to the CCTV show.
3.3 Incorporating bLSA into Spoken Language
Translation
To investigate the effectiveness of bLSA LM adap-
tation for spoken language translation, we incorpo-
rated the proposed approach into our state-of-the-art
phrase-based SMT system. Translation performance
was evaluated on the RT04 broadcast news evalua-
tion set when applied to both the manual transcrip-
tions and 1-best ASR hypotheses. During evalua-
tion two performance metrics, BLEU (Papineni et
al., 2002) and NIST, were computed. In both cases, a
single English reference was used during scoring. In
the transcription case the original English references
were used. For the ASR case, as utterance segmen-
tation was performed automatically, the number of
sentences generated by ASR and SMT differed from
the number of English references. In this case, Lev-
enshtein alignment was used to align the translation
output to the English references before scoring.
3.4 Baseline SMT Setup
The baseline SMT system consisted of a non adap-
tive system trained using the same Chinese-English
parallel document corpora used in the previous ex-
periments (Sections 3.1 and 3.2). For phrase extrac-
tion a cleaned subset of these corpora, consisting of
1M Chinese-English sentence pairs, was used. SMT
decoding parameters were optimized using man-
ual transcriptions and translations of 272 utterances
from the RT04 development set (LDC2006E10).
SMT translation was performed in two stages us-
ing an approach similar to that in (Vogel, 2003).
First, a translation lattice was constructed by match-
ing all possible bilingual phrase-pairs, extracted
from the training corpora, to the input sentence.
Phrase extraction was performed using the ?PESA?
(Phrase Pair Extraction as Sentence Splitting) ap-
proach described in (Vogel, 2005). Next, a search
was performed to find the best path through the lat-
tice, i.e. that with maximum translation-score. Dur-
ing search reordering was allowed on the target lan-
guage side. The final translation result was that
hypothesis with maximum translation-score, which
is a log-linear combination of 10 scores consist-
ing of Target LM probability, Distortion Penalty,
Word-Count Penalty, Phrase-Count and six Phrase-
Alignment scores. Weights for each component
score were optimized to maximize BLEU-score on
the development set using MER optimization as de-
scribed in (Venugopal et al, 2005).

3.5 Performance of Baseline SMT System
First, the baseline system performance was evalu-
ated by applying the system described above to the
reference transcriptions and 1-best ASR hypotheses
generated by our Mandarin speech recognition sys-
tem. The translation accuracy in terms of BLEU and
NIST for each individual show (?CCTV?, ?RFA?,
and ?NTDTV?), and for the complete test-set, are
shown in Table 4 (Baseline LM). When applied to
the reference transcriptions an overall BLEU score
of 0.132 was obtained. BLEU-scores ranged be-
tween 0.087 and 0.162 for the ?RFA?, ?NTDTV? and
?CCTV? shows, respectively. As the ?RFA? show
contained a large segment of conversational speech,
translation quality was considerably lower for this
show due to genre mismatch with the training cor-
pora of newspaper text.
For the 1-best ASR hypotheses, an overall BLEU
score of 0.095 was achieved. For the ASR case,
the relative reduction in BLEU scores for the RFA
and NTDTV shows is large, due to the significantly
lower recognition accuracies for these shows. BLEU
score is also degraded due to poor alignment of ref-
erences during scoring.
3.6 Incorporation of bLSA Adaptation
Next, the effectiveness of bLSA based LM adapta-
tion was evaluated. For each show the target En-
glish LM was adapted using bLSA-adaptation, as
described in Section 2.3. SMT was then applied us-
ing an identical setup to that used in the baseline ex-
periments.
The translation accuracy when bLSA adaptation
was incorporated is shown in Table 4. When ap-

plied to the manual transcriptions, bLSA adaptation
improved the overall BLEU-score by 1.7% relative
(from 0.132 to 0.134). For all three shows bLSA
adaptation gained higher BLEU and NIST metrics.
A similar trend was also observed when the pro-
posed approach was applied to the 1-best ASR out-
put. On the evaluation set a relative improvement in
BLEU score of 1.0% was gained.
The semantic interpretation of the majority of ut-
terances in broadcast news are not affected by topic
context. In the experimental evaluation it was ob-
served that only 25% of utterances produced differ-
ent translation output when bLSA adaptation was
performed compared to the topic-independent base-
line. Although the improvement in translation qual-
ity (BLEU) was small when evaluated over the en-
tire test set, the improvement in BLEU score for
526
these 25% utterances was significant. The trans-
lation quality for the baseline and bLSA-adaptive
system when evaluated only on these utterances is
shown in Figure 5 for the manual transcription case.
On this subset of utterances an overall improvement
in BLEU of 0.007 (5.7% relative) was gained, with
a gain of 0.012 (10.6% relative) points for the ?NT-
DTV? show. A similar trend was observed when ap-
plied to the 1-best ASR output. In this case a rel-
ative improvement in BLEU of 12.6% was gained
for ?NTDTV?, and for ?All shows? 0.007 (3.7%)
was gained. Current evaluation metrics for trans-
lation, such as ?BLEU?, do not consider the rela-
tive importance of specific words or phrases during
translation and thus are unable to highlight the true
effectiveness of the proposed approach. In future
work, we intend to investigate other evaluation met-
rics which consider the relative informational con-
tent of words.
4 Conclusions
We proposed a bilingual latent semantic model
for crosslingual LM adaptation in spoken language
translation. The bLSA model consists of a set of
monolingual LSA models in which a one-to-one
topic correspondence is enforced between the LSA
models through the sharing of variational Dirich-
let posteriors. Bootstrapping a LSA model for a
new language can be performed rapidly with topic
transfer from a well-trained LSA model of another
language. We transfer the inferred topic distribu-
tion from the input source text to the target lan-
guage effectively to obtain an in-domain target LSA
marginals for LM adaptation. Results showed that
our approach significantly reduces the word per-
plexity on the target language in both cases using
ASR hypotheses and manual transcripts. Interest-
ingly, the adaptation performance is not much af-
fected when ASR hypotheses were used. We eval-
uated the adapted LM on SMT and found that the
evaluation metrics are crucial to reflect the actual
improvement in performance. Future directions in-
clude the exploration of story-dependent LM adap-
tation with automatic story segmentation instead of
show-dependent adaptation due to the possibility of
multiple stories within a show. We will investigate
the incorporation of monolingual documents for po-
tentially better bilingual LSA modeling.
