Abstract
We describe a graph-based generation sys-
tem that participated in the TUNA attribute se-
lection and realisation task of the REG 2008
Challenge. Using a stochastic cost function
(with certain properties for free), and trying
attributes from cheapest to more expensive,
the system achieves overall .76 DICE and .54
MASI scores for attribute selection on the de-
velopment set. For realisation, it turns out
that in some cases higher attribute selection
accuracy leads to larger differences between
system-generated and human descriptions.
1 Introduction
Referring Expression Generation (REG) is a key-
task in NLG, and the topic of the REG 2008 Chal-
lenge.1 In this context, referring expressions are
understood as distinguishing descriptions: descrip-
tions that uniquely characterize a target object in a
visual scene (e.g., ?the red sofa?), and do not ap-
ply to any of the other objects in the scene (the dis-
tractors). Generating such descriptions is usually as-
sumed to be a two-step procedure: first, it has to be
decided which attributes of the target suffice to char-
acterize it uniquely, and then the selected set of at-
tributes should be converted into natural language.
For the first step, attribute selection, we use a ver-
sion of the Graph-based REG algorithm of Krahmer
et al (2003). In this approach, a visual scene is rep-
resented as a directed labelled graph, where vertices
represent the objects in the scene and edges their at-
tributes. A key ingredient of the approach is that

costs can be assigned to attributes; the generation
of referring expressions can then be defined as a
graph search problem, which outputs the cheapest
distinguishing graph (if one exists) given a particu-
lar cost function. For the second step, realisation, we
use a simple template-based realiser written by Irene
Langkilde-Geary from Brighton University that was
made available to all REG 2008 participants.
A version of the Graph-based algorithm was sub-
mitted for the ASGRE 2007 Challenge (Theune et
al. 2007). For us, one of the most striking, gen-
eral outcomes was the observed ?trend for the mean
DICE score obtained by a system to decrease as the
proportion of minimal descriptions increases? (Belz
and Gatt 2007).2 Thus, while REG systems have
a tendency to produce minimal descriptions, hu-
man speakers tend to include redundant properties in
their descriptions, which is in line with recent find-
ings in psycholinguistics on the production of refer-
ring expressions (e.g., Engelhardt et al 2006).
In principle, the graph-based approach has the po-
tential to deal with redundancy by allowing some at-
tributes to have zero costs. Viethen et al (2008),
however, show that merely assigning zero costs to
an attribute is not a sufficient condition for inclu-
sion; if the search terminates before the free prop-
erties are tried, they will not be included. In other
words: the order in which attributes are tried should
be explicitly controlled as well. In the experiment
we describe here, we consider both these factors and
their interplay.
2DICE (like MASI) is a measure for similarity between a pre-
dicted attribute set and a (human produced) reference set.

2 Method
We experimentally combine four cost functions and
two search orders (Table 1). (1) Simple simply as-
signs each edge a 1-point cost. (2) Stochastic asso-
ciates each edge with a frequency-based cost, based
on both the 2008 training and development sets (as-
suming that a larger data set alows for more ac-
curate frequency estimates). (3) Free-Stochastic is
like the previous cost function, except that highly
frequent attributes are assigned 0 costs. For the Fur-
niture domain, this applies to ?colour?; for People
to ?hasBeard = 1? and ?hasGlasses = 1.? (4) Free-
Naive, finally, reduces the relatively fine-grained
costs of Free-Stochastic to three values (0 = free,
1 = cheap, 2 = expensive). In addition, we com-
pare results for two property orderings: (A) Proper-
ties are tried in a Random order. (B) Cost-based,
where properties are tried (in stochastic order) from
cheapest to most expensive. Finally, since human
speakers nearly always include the ?type? property,
we decided to simply always include it. Tables 2 to
4 summarize the evaluation results for all combina-
tions of cost functions and search orders.
3 Attribute Selection Results
The measures used to evaluate attribute selection are
DICE, MASI, attribute accuracy (A-A, the proportion
of times the generated attribute set was identical to
the reference set), and minimality (MIN).
Notice first that the order in which attributes are
tried in the search process matters; the B-systems
nearly always outperform their A-counterparts. Sec-
ond, assigning varying costs also helps; both 1-
variants (Simple costs) perform worse than the sys-
tems building on Stochastic cost functions (2, 3
and 4). Third, adding free properties is also ben-
eficial; the 3 and 4 variants clearly outperform the
1 and 2 variants. It is interesting to observe that
the Free-naive cost function (4) performs equally
well as the more principled Free-stochastic (3), but
only in combination with the Cost-based order (B).
To the extent that it is possible to compare the re-
sults, the submitted GRAPH 4+B outperforms our
best 2007 variant (GRAPH FP in Table 2). This sug-
gests that the interplay between property ordering
and cost function is a flexible and efficient approach
to attribute selection.

4 Realization Results
To evaluate realisation, the following two word-
string comparison measures were used: string-edit
distance (EDIT), which is the Levenshtein distance
between generated word string and human reference
output, and string accuracy (S-A), which is the pro-
portion of times the word string was identical to the
reference string.
For all settings of the algorithm, we see that S-A
is much lower than A-A. This is as expected, since
any set of attributes can be expressed in many differ-
ent ways, and the chance that the realizer produces
exactly the same string as the human reference is
quite small. For the furniture domain, we see that
S-A has a fairly constant low score, while EDIT fol-
lows the same pattern as A-A: including redundant
(free) properties leads to better results. For the peo-
ple domain, S-A is always 0, and surprisingly EDIT
gets worse as A-A gets better.
To explain these results, we inspect those descrip-
tions where A-A = 1 but S-A = 0, i.e., the attribute
set is identical to the human reference but the word
string is not. In setting 4+B (submitted to REG 2008)
this is the case for 34 furniture and 19 people de-
scriptions. For furniture, we see that the low S-A
score can be largely explained by the fact that in 23
of the 34 descriptions the human reference either in-
cluded no determiner or an indefinite one, whereas
the system always included a definite determiner.
This also explains why S-A hardly improves with
higher A-A scores, since determiner choice is inde-
pendent from attribute selection.
In the people domain, the zero scores for S-A can
be explained by the fact that the realizer always uses
?person? to express the type attribute, where the hu-
man references have either ?man? or ?guy? (in line
with the human preference for basic level values; cf.
Krahmer et al 2003). We also encounter the de-
terminer problem again, aggravated by the fact that
many person descriptions include embedded noun
phrases (e.g., ?man with beard?).
To find out why EDIT gets worse as A-A increases
for different system settings in the people domain,
we look at the six descriptions that have A-A = 1
for setting 4+B but not for 4+A. It turns out that
five of these descriptions are realized as ?the light-
haired person with a beard?, while the human refer-
ence strings are variations of ?the man with a white
beard?, resulting in a relatively high EDIT value. The
problem here is that the link between beard and hair
colour has been lost in the data annotation process.
In general, we can conclude that simply combin-
ing more or less human-like attribute selection with
an off-the-shelf surface realiser is not sufficient to
produce human-like referring expressions.
