Abstract
This paper presents a comparative evalua-
tion among the systems that participated
in the Spanish and English lexical sam-
ple tasks of SENSEVAL-2. The focus is
on pairwise comparisons among systems
to assess the degree to which they agree,
and on measuring the difficulty of the test
instances included in these tasks.
1 Introduction
This paper presents a post-mortem analysis of
the English and Spanish lexical sample tasks of
SENSEVAL-2. Two closely related questions are
considered. First, to what extent did the compet-
ing systems agree? Did systems tend to be redun-
dant and have success with many of the same test in-
stances, or were they complementary and able to dis-
ambiguate different portions of the instance space?
Second, how much did the difficulty of the test in-
stances vary? Are there test instances that proved
unusually difficult to disambiguate relative to other
instances?
We address the first question via a series of pair-
wise comparisons among the participating systems
that measures their agreement via the kappa statis-
tic. We also introduce a simple measure of the de-
gree to which systems are complementary called op-
timal combination. We analyze the second question
by rating the difficulty of test instances relative to the
number of systems that were able to disambiguate
them correctly.
Nearly all systems that received official scores
in the Spanish and English lexical sample tasks of
SENSEVAL-2 are included in this study. There are
23 systems included from the English lexical sam-
ple task and eight from the Spanish. Table 1 lists the
systems and shows the number of test instances that
each disambiguated correctly, both by part of speech
and in total.
2 Pairwise System Agreement
Assessing agreement among systems sheds light on
whether their combined performance is potentially
more accurate than that of any of the individual sys-
tems. If several systems are largely in agreement,
then there is little benefit in combining them since
they are redundant and will simply reinforce one an-
other. However, if some systems disambiguate in-
stances that others do not, then they are complemen-
tary and it may be possible to combine them to take
advantage of the different strengths of each system
to improve overall accuracy.
The kappa statistic (Cohen, 1960) is a measure of
agreement between multiple systems (or judges) that
is scaled by the agreement that would be expected
just by chance. A value of 1.00 suggests complete
agreement, while 0.00 indicates pure chance agree-
ment. Negative values indicate agreement less than
what would be expected by chance. (Krippendorf,
1980) points out that it is difficult to specify a par-
ticular value of kappa as being generally indicative
of agreement. As such we simply use kappa as a
tool for comparison and relative ranking. A detailed
discussion on the use of kappa in natural language
processing is presented in (Carletta, 1996).

To study agreement we have made a series of pair-
wise comparisons among the systems included in the
English and Spanish lexical sample tasks. Each pair-
wise combination is represented in a 2  2 contin-
gency table, where one cell represents the number of
test instances that both systems disambiguate cor-
rectly, one cell represents the number of instances
where both systems are incorrect, and there are two
cells to represent the counts when only one system is
correct. Agreement does not imply accuracy, since
two systems may get a large number of the same in-
stances incorrect and have a high rate of agreement.
Tables 2 and 3 show the system pairs in the
English and Spanish lexical sample tasks that ex-
hibit the highest level of agreement according to the
kappa statistic. The values in the both?one?zero col-
umn indicate the percentage of instances where both
systems are correct, where only one is correct, and
where neither is correct. The top 15 pairs are shown
for nouns and verbs, and the top 10 for adjectives.
A complete list would include about 250 pairs for
each part of speech for English and 24 such pairs for
Spanish.
The utility of kappa agreement is confirmed in
that system pairs known to be very similar have cor-
respondingly high measures. In Table 2, duluth2
and duluth3 exhibit a high kappa value for all parts
of speech. This is expected since duluth3 is an en-
semble approach that includes duluth2 as one of its
members. The same relationship exists between du-
luth7 and duluth8 in the Spanish lexical sample, and
comparable behavior is seen in Table 3.
A more surprising case is the even higher level of
agreement between the most common sense base-
line and the lesk corpus baseline shown in Table 2.
This is not necessarily expected, and suggests that
lesk corpus may not be finding a significant number
of matches between the Senseval contexts and the
WordNet glosses (as the lesk algorithm would hope
to do) but instead may be relying on a simple default
in many cases.
In previous work (Pedersen, 2001) we propose a
50-25-25 rule that suggests that about half of the in-
stances in a supervised word sense disambiguation
evaluation will be fairly easy for most systems to
resolve, another quarter will be harder but possible
for at least some systems, and that the final quar-
ter will be very difficult for any system to resolve.

This same idea could also be expressed by stating
that the kappa agreement between two word sense
disambiguation systems will likely be around 0.50.
In fact this is a common result in the full set of pair-
wise comparisons, particularly for overall results not
broken down by part of speech. Tables 2 and 3 only
list the largest kappa values, but even there kappa
quickly reduces towards 0.50. These same tables
show that it is rare for two systems to agree on more
than 60% of the correctly disambiguated instances.
3 Optimal Combination
An optimal combination is the accuracy that could
be attained by a hypothetical tool called an optimal
combiner that accepts as input the sense assignments
for a test instance as generated by several different
systems. It is able to select the correct sense from
these inputs, and will only be wrong when none of
the sense assignments is the correct one. Thus, the
percentage accuracy of an optimal combiner is equal
to one minus the percentage of instances that no sys-
tem can resolve correctly.
Of course this is only a tool for thought experi-
ments and is not a practical algorithm. An optimal
combiner can establish an upper bound on the accu-
racy that could reasonably be attained over a partic-
ular sample of test instances.
Tables 4 and 5 list the top system pairs ranked
by optimal combination (1.00 - value in zero col-
umn) for the English and Spanish lexical samples.
Kappa scores are also shown to illustrate the inter-
action between agreement and optimal combination.
Optimal combination is maximized when the per-
centage of instances where both systems are wrong
is minimized. Kappa agreement is maximized by
minimizing the percentage of instances where one
or the other system (but not both) is correct. Thus,
the only way a system pair could have a high mea-
sure of kappa and a high measure of optimal com-
bination is if they were very accurate systems that
disambiguated many of the same test instances cor-
rectly.
System pairs with low measures of agreement
are potentially quite interesting because they are the
most likely to make complementary errors. For ex-
ample, in Table 5 under nouns, the alicante system
has a low level of agreement with all of the other

systems. However, the measure of optimal combi-
nation is quite high, reaching 0.89 (1.00 - 0.11) for
the pair of alicante and jhu. In fact, all seven of the
other systems achieve their highest optimal combi-
nation value when paired with alicante.
This combination of circumstances suggests that
the alicante system is fundamentally different than
the other systems, and is able to disambiguate a cer-
tain set of instances where the other systems fail. In
fact the alicante system is different in that it is the
only Spanish lexical sample system that makes use
of the structure of Euro-WordNet, the source of the
sense inventory.
4 Instance Difficulty
The difficulty of disambiguating word senses can
vary considerably. A word with multiple closely re-
lated senses is likely to be more difficult than one
with a few starkly drawn differences. In supervised
learning, a particular sense of a word can be diffi-
cult to disambiguate if there are a small number of
training examples available.
Table 6 shows the distribution of the number of
instances that are successfully disambiguated by a
particular number of systems in both the English
and Spanish lexical samples. The value under the
# column shows the number of systems that are able
to disambiguate the number of noun, verb, adjec-
tive and total instances shown in the row. The aver-
age number of training examples available for the
correct answers associated with these instances is
shown in parenthesis. For example, the first line
shows that there were 59 noun instances that no sys-
tem (of 23) could disambiguate, and that there were
on average 16 training examples available for each
of the correct senses for these 59 instances.
Two very clear trends emerge. First, there are a
substantial number of instances that are not disam-
biguated correctly by any system (262 in English,
228 in Spanish) and there are a large number of in-
stances that are disambiguated by just a handful of
systems. In the English lexical sample, there are
1,277 test instances that are correctly disambiguated
by five or fewer of the 23 systems. This is nearly
30% of the test data, and confirms that this was a
very challenging set of test instances.
There is also a very clear correlation between the
number of training examples available for a particu-
lar sense of a word and the number of systems that
are able to disambiguate instances of that word cor-
rectly. For example, Table 6 shows that there were
174 English verb instances that no system disam-
biguated correctly. On average there were only 6
training examples for the correct senses of these in-
stances. However, there were 28 instances that all
23 English systems were able to disambiguate. For
these instances an average of 47 training examples
were available for each correct sense.
This correlation between instance difficulty and
number of training examples may suggest that future
SENSEVAL exercises provide a minimum number of
training examples for each sense, or adjust the scor-
ing to reflect the difficulty of disambiguating a sense
with very few training examples.
Finally, we assess the difficulty associated with
word types by calculating the average number of
systems that were able to disambiguate the instances
associated with that type. This information is pro-
vided for the English and Spanish lexical samples in
Tables 7 and 8. Each word is shown with its part of
speech, the number of test instances, and the average
number of systems that were able to disambiguate
each of the test instances.
The verb collaborate is the easiest according to
this metric in the English lexical sample. It has 30
test instances that were disambiguated correctly by
an average of 20.2 of the 23 systems. The verb find
proves to be the most difficult, with 68 test instances
disambiguated correctly by an average of 4.2 sys-
tems. A somewhat less extreme range of values is
observed for the Spanish lexical sample in Table 8.
The adjective claro had 66 test instances that were
disambiguated correctly by an average of 7.6 of the
8 systems. The most difficult word was the verb con-
ducir, which has 54 test instances that were disam-
biguated correctly by an average of 3.8 systems.
5 Conclusion
This paper presents an analysis of the results from
the English and Spanish lexical sample tasks of
SENSEVAL-2. The analysis is based on the kappa
statistic and a measure known as optimal combina-
tion. It also assesses the difficulty of the test in-
stances in these lexical samples. We find that there
are a significant number of test instances that were
not disambiguated correctly by any system, and that
there is some correlation between instance difficulty
and the number of available training examples.
