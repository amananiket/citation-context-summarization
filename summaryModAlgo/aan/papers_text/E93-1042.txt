Abstract 
A new class of formal languages will be defined 
the Distributed Index Languages (DI-lan- 
guages). The grammar-formalism generating the 
new class - the DI-grammars - cover unbound 
dependencies in a rather natural way. The place 
of DI-languages in the Chomsky-hierarchy will 
be determined: Like Aho's indexed Languages, 
DI-languages represent a proper subclass of 
Type 1 (contextsensitive languages) and prop- 
erly include Type 2 (context-free languages), but 
the DI-class is neither a subclass nor a super- 
class of Aho's indexed class. It will be shown 
that, apart from DI-grammars, DI-languages can 
equivalently be characterized by a special type of 
automata - DI-automata. Finally, the time com- 
plexity of the recognition-problem for an inter- 
esting subclass of DI-Grammars will approxi- 
mately be determined. 
I Introduction 
It is common practice to parse nested Wh-dependen- 
cies, like the classical example of Rizzi (1982) in (1), 
(1) Tuo fratello, \[a cui\]l mi domando \[che storie\]2 
abbiano raccontato t 2 t 1, era molto preoccupato 
(Your Brother, \[to whom\] 1 I wonder \[which sto- 
ries\] 2 they told t 2 t 1 was very troubled) 
using a stack mechanism. Under the binary branching 
hypothesis the relevant structure of (1) augmented by 
wh-stacks is as follows: 
(2) 
\[a cui\] 1 mi dornando 
Lpush ---tit 11--~ i--push ---~\[t2,tll--- 1 
\[che storie\]2abbiano V2\[t2,tl\] 
/ \ 
vlIt21 PPItll 
/ \ 
V~I\] NP.It2I pop 
IP?P \] 
raccontato t 2 t 1 
Up to now it is unclear, how far beyond context- 
freeness the generative power of a Type 2 grammar 
formalism is being extended if such a stack mechanism 
is grafted on it (assuming, of course, that an upper 
bound for the size of the stack can not be motivated). 
Fernando Pereira's concept of Extraposition Gram- 
mar (XG), introduced in his influential paper (Pereira, 
1981; 1983; cf. Stabler, 1987) in order to delimit the 
new territory, can be shown to be inadequate for this 
purpose, since it is provable that the class of languages 
generable by XGs coincides with Type 0 (i,e. XGs have 
the power of Turing machines), whereas the increase of 
power by the stack mechanism is not even enough to 
generate all Type 1 languages (see below). 
In (2) an additional point is illustrated: 
the stack \[t2,tl\] belonging to V 2 has to be divided into 
the substacks \[t2\] and \[tl\], which are then inherited by 
the daughters V l and PP. For the PP-index tlis not dis- 
charged from the top of the V2-stack \[t2,tl\]. Generaliz- 
ing to stacks of unlimited size, the partition of a stack 
among the inheriting subconstituents K 1 and K 2 of a 
constituent K 0 is as in (3) 
(3) K0 It 1,...,tj,tj+l,...,tk\] 
/ \ 
Klltl,...,tjl K2ltj+l,...,tkl 
358 
If the generalization i  (3) is tenable, the extension of 
context-free grmnmars (Vijay-Shanker and Weir, 1991, 
call the resulting formalism "linear indexed granunar" 
(LIG)) discussed by Gazdar in (Gazdar, 1988), in 
which stacks are exclusively passed over to a single 
daughter (as in (3.1)), is too weak. 
(3.1) a)K0\[tl,..,,tk\] b) KoItl,....,tk\] 
/ \ / \ 
Kl\[tl,...,t k\] K 2 K1 K2\[tl,...,tk\] 
Stack-transmission by distribution, however, as in (3) 
suggests the definition of a new class of grammars 
properly containing the context-free class. 
2 Dl=Grammars and DI- languages 
A DI-grammar is a 5-tupel G = (N,T,F,P,S), where 
N,T,S are as usual, F is a alphabet of indices, P is a set 
of rules of the following form 
1) (a) A --> o~ (b)A-->aBf~ (c)Af->o~, 
(A, BeN; o~, Be(N~T)*;feF) 
The relation "= >" or "directly derives" is defined as 
follows: 
2)o~ => 1) 
if either i) 
= 5A/ndex ?, 8,y e (NF*uT)*, indexeF*, AeN, 
A --) BIB2...B n is a rule of form 1)(a) 
8 = 8BlindexlB2index2...BnindexnT 
or ii) 
o~ = 8A/ndex y, 8,T e (NF*wT)*, index eF*, AeN, 
A --) B 1..Bkf.. B n is a rule of form 1)(b), fEF 
B = 5Blindexl...Bkfindexk...Bnindexn7 
or iii) 
ct = 8Afindex y ,8 ,? e (NF*vT)*, index eF*, AeN, 
Af --* B1B2...B n is a rule of form 1)(c), feF  
B = 8BlindexlB2index2...Bnindexny 
(*) and index = indexlindex2...index n, 
and for B i e T: index i = ~ O.e. the empty word) 
(o~a) 
The reflexive and transitive closure *=> of => is de- 
fined as usual. 
Replacing (*) by"mdex i = index for Bie N, index i = 
for B i e T", changes the above definition into a defini- 
tion of Aho's well known indexed grammars. How in- 
dex-percolation differs in indexed and Di-grammars i
illustrated in (4).

where 
(5.1) L 1 = {anbncn; n_>_> 1 } 
(5.2) L 2 = {a k, k = 2 n, 0 < n} 
(5.3) L 3 = {WlW2...WnZlWn...ZnWlZn+lm(wn)m(Wn. 1) 
...m(w2)m(wl); n.~l & wie{a,b} + (1.~i~n) & 
ZlZ2...ZnZn+ 1 e D 1 } 
m(y) is the mirror image of y and D 1 is the 
Dyck language generated by the following 
CFG G k (DI=L(Gk)), G k = ({S},{\[,I},R k, S), 
where R k = {S -~ \[S\], S ~ SS, S -~ ~} 
(5.4) L 4 = {ak; k = n n, n.~>l}; (L 4 is not an indexed 
language, s.Takeshi Hayashi (1973)). 
By definition (see above), the intersection of the class 
of indexed languages and the class of DI-languages in- 
cludes the context-free ( rr) languages. The inclusion is 
proper, since the (non-cfr) language L 1 is generated by 
G 1 = ({S,A,B}, {a,b,c}, {f,g}, R 1, S), where R 1 = {S 
-+ aAfc, A --, aAgc, A --, B, Bg --, bB, Bf -+ b}, and 
G 1 obviously is both a DI-gratmnax and and an indexed 
grammar,- 
Like cfr. languages and unlike indexed languages, 
DI-languages have the constant growth property (i.e. 
for every DI-grammar G there exists a keN, s.th. for 
every weL(G), s.th. \[wl>k, there exists a sequence w1 
359 
(--w), w2,w3,...(wi?L(G)) , such that Iwnl < IWn+ll < 
(n+l)xlwl for every member w n of the sequence). Hence 
L2, and afortiori L4, is not a DI-language. But L2 is an 
indexed language, since it is generated by the indexed 
grammar G 2 =({S,A,D}, {a}, {f,g}, R 2, S), where R 2 
= {S --~Ag, A ---> Af, A ---> D, Df--~ DD, Dg --~ a}. 
L 3 is a DI-language, since it is generated by the DI- 
grammar G3 -- ({S,M,Z},{a,b,\[,\]},{f,g},R3,S) where 
R3 = { S ~ aSfa, M ~ \[M\], Zf  ~ Za, Zg ~ Zb, 
S---~bSgb, M---~MM, Zf --~ a, Zg --~ b 
S ---> M, M--~ Z } 
e.g, abb\[b\[ab\]\]bba ( ?  L3) is derived as follows: 
S ~ aSfa ~ abSg/ba ~ abbSgg/bba ~ abbMgg/bba 
abb\[Mgg\]\]bba = bb\[MgMg/\]bba (here the index "ggf' 
has been distributed) ~ abb\[ZgMgl\]bba 
abb\[bMg/\]bba ~ abb\[b\[Mg/\]\]bba ~ abb\[b\[Zg/\]\]bba 
abblb\[Zfo\]\]bba ~ abblb\[ab\]\]bba. 
2.1 DI-Grammars and Indexed Grammars 
Considering the well known generative strength of in- 
dexed grammars, it is by no means obvious that L 3 is 
not an indexed language. In view of the complexity of 
the proof that L3 is not indexed, only some important 
points can be indicated - referring to the 3 main parts 
of every word x ? L 3 by Xl, \[Xm\],Xr,aS illustrated in the 
example (6): 
(6 )

' x 1,- J, \[ Xm\]  i i X r  i 
= x 
Assume that there is a indexed grammar GI= 
(N,T,F,P,S) such that L3=L(GI): 
1. Since G I can not be contextfree, it follows from the 
intercalation (or "pumping") lemma for indexed gram- 
mars proved by Takeshi Hayashi n (Hayashi, 1973) 
that there exists for G I an integer k such that for any x 
? L 3 such that Ixl>k a derivation can be found with the 
following properties: 
S =*=> zAfr/z'=*=> ZSlAf/.tfr/s I "z" 
=*=> zslrlAf#frirl'Sl'Z'=*=>zslrlBf#frlrl'Sl" z, 
=*=> zslrtlBfr/t l 'r 's 1 'z" =*=> x, 
(zz', r lr 1"? T*, Sltlt l 's 1" ? T +, f ? F, ~t, rI ? F*) 
By intercalating subderivations which can effectively 
be constructed this derivation can be extended as fol- 
lows 
S =* => zAfqz'=*=>zs 1Af# fqs 1 "z" 
=*=> zs 1...snA0C#')nfr}sn...s 1 "z" 
=*=> zs l...SnrnB(f# 3nfqrn'Sn... s 1'z" 
=*=> ZSl...Snrntn...tlBfr/t l'...tn'rn'sn'.., s 1'z' 
=*=> ZSl...Snrntn...tlwt 1 "...tn'rn'Sn'... s 1"z" 
The interdependently extendible parts of x Sl...s n, 
tn...t 1, t l'...tn', rnrn', and Sn'... s 1", can not all be sub- 
words of the central component \[Xm\] of x (or all be 
subwords of the peripheral components XlXr), else, 
\[Xm\] (or XlXr) could be increased and decreased inde- 
pendently of the peripheral components x 1 and x r (or of 
\[Xm\], respectively) of x ,  contradicting the assumption 
that x ? L 3. Rather, the structure of x necessitates that 
.Sl...s n and Sn'...s 1' be subwords of XlX r and that the 
"pumped" index (f# 3 n be discharged eriving the cen- 
tral component \[Xm\]. Thus, we know that for every/>0 
there exists an index IX ? F +, a x ? L3, and a subword 
\[Xm" \]of the central part \[Xm\] of x such that \[Xm'\]>l 
and M~t=*=>\[Xm" \] (M=B or the nonterminal of a de- 
scendant of A(f# 3nfo). To simplify our exposition we 
write Ix m'\] instead of \[Xm\] and have 
(7) MIx =*=> \[Xm\] 
with the structure of x I and x r being encoded and stored 
in the index IX. 
2. The balanced parentheses of \[Xm\] can not be en- 
coded in the index Ix in (7) in such a manner that \[Xm\] 
is a homomorphic image of Ix. For the set I={Ix'; 
S=*=>XlMIx'x r =*=>Xl\[Xm\]X r ?L  3 } of all indices which 
satisfy (7) is regular (or of Type 3), but because of the 
Dyek-strueture of \[Xm\] , LM={\[Xm\];Xl\[Xm\]Xr?L3} is 
not regular but essentially context-free orof Type 2. 
3. In the derivation underlying (7) essential use of 
branching rules of the type A--~B1B2...B k (k_>.2) has to 
be made in the sense that the effect of the rules can not 
be simulated by linear rules. Else the central part \[Xm\] 
could only have linear and not trans-linear Dyck-struc- 
ture. Without branching rules the required trans-linear 
parenthetical structure could only be generated by the 
use of additional index-introducing rules in (7), in or- 
der to "store" and coordinate parentheses, which, how- 
ever, would destroy the dependence of \[x m\] from x I and 
x r ? 
4.For every n_>_> 1,L 3 contains words w of the form 
(8) 
Wl..WkIIl..lIllwkllWk.lllllwk.211wk_alll..llll..lllm(wk)..m(w 1) 
t-.n+l~ t-.n+l--a 
360 
where k=2 n, wie {a,b} + for l<i_<2n; m(w i) is the mirror 
image of wf 
i.e the central part \[Xm\] of such a word contains 
2n+l' l  pairs of parentheses, asshown in (9) for n=3: 
(9) \[\[\[\[wsl\[w7l\]\[\[w6l\[w5lll\[\[\[w4l\[w3ll\[\[w2\]\[Wl\]\]\]\] 
According to our assumption, G I generates all words 
having the form (8). Referring to the derivation in (7), 
consider a path from MIx to any of the parenthesized 
parts w i of \[Xm\] in (8). (Ignoring for expositional pur- 
poses the possibility of "storing" (a constant amount of) 
parentheses in nonterminal nodes,) because of 2. and 3. 
an injective mapping can be defined from the set of 
pairs of parentheses containing at least two other (and 
because of the structure of (8) disjunct) pairs of paren- 
theses into the set of branching nodes with (at least) 
two nonterminal daughters. Call a node in the range of 
the mapping a P-Node. Assuming without loss of gen- 
erality that each node has at most two nonterminal 
daughters, there are 2n-1 such P-nodes in the subtree 
rooted in MIx and yielding the parenthesized part \[Xm\] 
of (8). Furthermore, every path from MIx to the root W i 
of the subtree yielding \[wi\] contains exactly n P-nodes (
where 2n=-k in (8)). 
Call an index-symbol f inside the index-stack ixa w i- 
index if f is discharged into a terminal constituting a
parenthesized w i in (8) (or equivalently, if f encodes a
symbol of the peripheral Xl..Xr). 
Let ft be the first (or leflmos0 wi-index from above in 
the index-stack Ix, and let w t be the subword of \[Xm\] 
containing the terminal into which ft is discharged, i.e 
all other wi-indices in Ix are only accessible after ft has 
been consumed. Thus, for Ix=alto we get from (7) 
Mafto-=+=>uBt \[v.t f o\]v=+=>utWt \[~fto\]vt and 
Wt\[ffto\]ffi+=>wt 
The path Pt from Mix to w t contains n B-nodes, for 
k=2 n in (8). For every B-node Bj (0_<j<n) of Pt we ob- 
tain because of the index-multiplication effected by no- 
terminal branching: 
Bjt jft J= > Ljt jgtolRjt ft \] and 
Lj \[xjfta\] =* = >uj+ 1Bj+ l\[%j+lfto\]vj + 1 
(Bj,Bj + 1,Lj,Rj ~ N, xj,xj+ 1,(IeF*,ft EF,u j + 1,vj + I e {a, 
b,\[,\]}*) 
Every path Pj branching off from Pt at Bj\[xjfto \] leads 
to a word wj derived exclusively by discharging wi-in- 
dices situated in Ix below (or on the right side of) ft. 
Consequently, ft has to be deleted on every such path 
Pj, before the appropriate indices become accessible, 
i.e. we get for every j with 0< j<n: 
ajE'jft"\] = >ujRjt j t,,Jyj =* = > yjqtfto\] , 
(Bj,Rj,Cj eN,xj,o F*,ft 
Thus, for n>lN\[ in (8) (INI the cardinality of the non- 
terminal alphabet N of G I, ignoring, as before the con- 
stant amount of parenthesis-storing in nonterminals) 
because of \[{Cj;0<j<n}l=n the node-label Cj\[fto \]occurs 
twice on two different paths branching off from Pt, i.e. 
there exist p, q (0_<p<q<n) such that: 
Mnftcr = + = > UpRp\[xpftO\]vqRq\[Xq fto\]y and 
= = > ypC\[fto\]z p = + = > ypZZp Rp\[xpfto \] *

where z~{ZlWl...ZrWrZr+l; wi~{a,b} & Zl...Zr+l~D 1
(= the Dyck-language from (5.3)}. 
I.e. G I generates words w" =Xl"\[Xm"\]Xr", the central 
part of which contain a duplication (of "z" in 
\[Xm"\]=ylzY2zy 3) without correspondence in Xl" or Xr", 
thus contradicting the general form of words of L 3. 
Hence L 3 is not indexed. 
2.2 DI-Grammars and Linear Indexed Grammars I 
As already mentioned above, Gazdar in (Gazdar, 1988) 
introduced and discussed a grammar formalism, after- 
wards (e.g. in (Weir and Joshi, 1988)) called linear in- 
dexed granunars (LIG's), using index stacks in which 
only one nonterminai on the right-hand-side of a rule 
can inherit the stack from the left-hand-side, i.e. the 
rules of a LIG G=(N,T, F, P, S) with N,F,T,S as above, 
are of the Form 
i. A\[..\] ~A1U...Ai\[..\]..~I n 
ii. A\[..\] -~AI\[\]...Ai\[f..\]...A n 
iii. A \[f..\]-~A 1 \[\]...Ai\[..\]...An 
iv. All ~a  
whereA 1,...,AneN, feF, and aeT~{e}. The "derives"- 
relation => is defined as follows 
o(A \[fl.. fn\] ~=>o~ i H...A \[fl.. fn\]..-~n\[\] ~

if A\[\] --+aeP 
=*---> is the reflexive and transitive closure of =>, and 
L(G)={w; weT* & S\[\]=*=>w}. 
Gazdar has shown that LIGs are a (proper) subclass of 
indexed grammars. Joshi, Vijay-Shanker, and Weir 
(Joshi, Vijay?Shanker, and Weir, 1989; Weir and Joshi, 
1988) have shown that LIGs, Combinatory Categorial 
Grammars (CCG), Tree Adjoinig Grammars (TAGs), 
and Head Grammars (HGs) are weakly equivalent. 
Thus, ff an inclusion relation can be shown to hold be- 
tween DI-languages (DIL) and LILs, it simultaneously 
holds between the DIL-class and all members of the 
family. 
To simulate the restriction on stack transmission i a 
LIG GI=(N1,T , FI, P1, S1) the following construction of 
a DI-grammar Gd suggests itself: 
Let G d =(N, T, F, P, S) where N-{S}={X'; XeN1}, 
F={f'; fEF1}~{#}, and P={S--+SI'#} 
u{A'--~A l'#...Ai'...An'#; A\[..\] ---~A 1 \[\]..Ai\[..\]...An~PI} 
~{A'-+A 1"#...Ai'f'... An'#;A \[..\] ---~A 1 \[\].-Ai\[f..\].-An~P1} 
u{A' f '~A I'#...Ai'...An'#;A\[f..\]-~A l\[\].-Ai\[..\]'tlnePl} 
~{A'#---~a; A\[\] --~a~Pl} 
It follows by induction on the number of derivation 
steps that for X'eN, X~NI, tt'~F*, tt~Fi*, and w ~T* 
(10) X'tt'#=*o=>w if and only if X\[~t\]=*Gl=>w 
where X'=h(X) and ~t'=h(10 (h is the homomorphism 
from (NIwFI)* into (NuF)* with h(Z)=Z'). For the 
nontrivial part of the induction, note that A'#~t" can not 
be terminated in G. 
Together with S=>S 1"# (I0) yields L(GI)=L(G ). 
The inclusion of the LIG-class in the DI-class is 
proper, since L 3 above is not a LIG-language, or to 
give a more simple example: 
Lw= {analnla2nlbln2b2n2b  \[ n = nl + n2} is accord- 
ing to (Vijay-Shanker, Weir and Joshi, 1987) not in 
TAL, hence not in LIL. But (the indexed langauge) L w 
is generated by the DI-Grammar 
Gw=({ S,A,B },{a,b,al,a2,b 1,b2 },{ S--~aSIb, S--~AB,Af---~ 
a 1Aa2,Bf--~b 1Bb2,Af--+ala2,Bf-+b lb2,A-+e,B"+e},S). 
2.3 Generalized Composition and Combinatory 
Categorial Grammars 
The relation of DI-granunars to Steedman's Combina- 
tory Categorial Grammars with Generalized Composi- 
tion (GC-CCG for short) in the sense of (Weir and 
Joshi, 1988) is not so easy to determine. If for each n~_>l 
composition rules of the form 
(x/y) (...(Yllzll)12....Inzn)--, (...(XllZll)12....Inzn) and 
(...(YllZll)12....Inzn) (x\y)~ (...(XllZll)12....Inzn) 
are permitted, the generative power of the resulting 
grammars is known to be stronger than TAGs (Weir 
and Joshi, 1988). 
Now, the GC-CCG given by 
f(~)={#} f(al)={SDU#, SDG#, #/X/#,#/X~#} 
f(a)={A,XkA} fCol)={S/Y/#, S/Y~#, #/YI#,#/~#} 
f(b)={B, YxB} f(D ={K} f(\])={#/#kK, ~#~Z} 
generates a language Lc, which when intersected with 
the regular set 
{ a,b}+{ \[,\],a 1,b 1 }+{a,b} + 
yields a language Lp which is for similar reasons as L 3 
not even an indexed language. But Lp does not seem to 
be a DI-language ither. Hence, since indexed lan- 
guages and DI-languages are closed under intersection 
with regular sets., L c is neither an indexed nor (so it 
appears) a DI-language. 
The problem of a comparison of DI-grammars and 
GC-CCGs is that, inspite of all appearances, the com- 
bination of generalized forward and backward com- 
position can not directly simulate nor be simulated by 
index-distribution, atleast so it seems. 
3 DI-Automata 
An alternative method of characterizing DI-languages 
is by means of DI-automata defined below. 
Dl-automata (dia) have a remote resemblance to 
Aho's nested stack automata (nsa). They can best be 
viewed as push down automata (pda) with additional po- 
wer: they can not only read and write on top of their 
push down store, but also travel down the stack and 
(recursively) create new embedded substacks (which can 
be left only after deletion), dia's and nsa's differ in the 
following respects: 
1. a dia is only allowed to begin to travel down the 
stack or enter the stack reading mode, if a tape,symbol 
A on top of the stack has been deleted and stored in a 
special stack-reading-state qA, and the stack-reading 
mode has to be terminated as soon as the first index- 
symbol f from above is being scanned, in which case 
the index-symbol concerned is deleted and an embed- 
ded stack is created, provided the transition-function 
gives permission. Thus, every occurrence of an index- 
symbol on the stack can only be "consumed" once, and 
362 
only in combination with a "matching" non-index-sym- 
bol. 
A nsa, on the other hand, embeds new stacks behind 
tape symbols which are preserved and can, thus, be 
used for further stack-embeddings. This provides for 
part of the stack multiplication effect. 
2. Moving through the stack in the stack reading mode, 
a dia is not allowed to pass or skip an index symbol. 
Moreover, no scanning of the input or change of state is 
permitted in this mode. 
A nsa, however, is allowed both to scan its input and 
change its state in the stack reading mode, which, to- 
gether with the license to pass tape symbols repeatedly, 
provides for another part of the stack multiplication ef- 
fect. 
3. Unlike a nsa, a dia needs two tape alphabets, since 
only "index symbols" can be replaced by new stacks, 
moreover it requires two sets of states in order to di- 
stinguish the pushdown mode from the stack reading 
mode. 
Formally, a di-automaton is a 10-tuple D ={q, Q17 T,F, 
Z~,z~s,?,#), 
where q is the control state for the pushdown mode,

The following theorem expresses the equivalence of DI- 
grammars and DI-automata 
(11) DI-THEOREM: L is a Dl-language (i.e. L 
is generated by a Dl-grammar) if  and only if  L 
is accepted by a Dl-automaton. 
Proof sketch: 
I. "only irk(to facilitate a comparison this part follows 
closely Aho's corresponding proof for indexed gram- 
mars and nsa's (theorem 5.1) in (Aho, 1969)) 
If L is a DI-language, then there exists a DI-grammar 
G=(N,T,F,P,S) with L(G)=L. For every DI-grammar an 
equivalent DI-grammar in a normal form can be con- 
structed in which each rule has the form A---~BC, A-~a, 
A---~Bf or Af---~B, with A?N; B,C?(N-{S}), a?T, f~F; 
and e ? L(G), only if S---~e is in P. (The proof is com- 
pletely analogous to the corresponding one for indexed 
grammars in (Aho, 1968) and is therefore omitted). 
Thus, we can assume without loss of generality that G 
is in normal form. 
A DI-automaton D such that N(D)=L(G) is constructed 
as follows: 
Let D=(q, Q17T, IS, l,d,,Z~$,?,#), with T=N~T~{$,?,#}, 
QI~{qA;Ae2-~, I=F, Zo=S where ~ is constructed in

LEMMA 1.1 
If

Proof by induction on n (i.e. the number of derivation 
steps): 
If n=l, then (i) is of the form A=>a where acT and 
k=0, since only a rule of the form A--+a can be applied 
because of the normal form of G and since in 
DI-grammars (unlike in indexed grammars) unconsu- 
med indices can not be swallowed up by terminals. Be- 
cause of the construction of5, (ii) is of the form 
(q,a#, 1,~$^AZ~ 1...\[3k~t#) = (q,a#, 1,~$^AZlx#) 
\[-D(q,a#, 1,ot$AaZ~t#)

Suppose Lemma 1.1 is true for all n<n' with n'> 1.

the following three forms according as A is expanded

II.("iP) 
If L is accepted by a DI-automaton D=(q, QFZF  
d,L,Z6$,?,#), then we can assume without loss of gen- 
erality 
a) that D writes at most two symbols on a stack in ei- 
filer the push down mode or the stack creation mode (it 
follows from the Di-automaton definition that the first 
one of the two symbols cannot be a index symbol from 
I), 
b) that T and F are disjunct. 
A DI-grammar G with L(G)=N(D)=L can be con- 
structed as follows: 
Let G=tN,F,T,P,S) with N=F, F=I, S=Z 0. P contains 
for all aeT, A,B,CeN, and feF the productions 
(da=a, if d=1, else da=6 )

(q, O,$$BC?) e d(qA,a,$./)

I'D n (q, al .--am#,m+l,~x$^~ 1 ..- k~ t#) 
then in G the derivation is valid 
Afl...fk=*=>al . ..a m . 
II.2: If 
Af 1...fk=n=->al ...a m- 
is a lefanost derivation in G, then the following transi- 
tion of D is valid 
(q, al...am#,l,o~$^A\[3 lfl...~kfklt#) 
i'D* (q, al...am#,m+l,~$^l~l...13k~t#) 
The proofs by induction of 1.1 and H.2 (unlike the 
proofs of the corresponding lemmata for nsa's and in- 
dexed grammars (s.Aho, (1969)) are as elementary as 
the one given above for I. 1 and are omitted. 
The DI-automaton concept can be used to show the 
inclusion of the class of DI-languages in the class of 
context-seusitive languages. The proof is strucuraUy 
very similar to the one given by Aho (Aho, 1968) for 
the inclusion of the indexed class in the context-sensi- 
tive class: For every DI-automaton A, an equivalent DI- 
automaton A" can be constructed which accepts its in- 
put w ff and only ira accepts w and which in addition 
uses a stack the length of which is bounded by a linear 
function of the length of the input w. For A" a linear 
bounded automaton M (i.e the type of automaton char- 
acteristic of the context-sensitive class) can be con- 
structed which simulates A : For reasons of space the 
extensive proof can not be given here. 
Some Remarks on the Complexity of 
DI-Recognition 
The time complexity of the recognition problem for DI- 
grammars will only be considered for a subclass of DI- 
grammars. As the restriction on the form of the rules is 
reminiscent of the Chomsky normal form for context- 
free grammars (CFG), the grammars in the subclass 
will be called DI-Chomsky normal form (DI-CNF) 
grammars 
A DI-grammar G=(N,T,F,P,S) is a DI-CNF grammar 
ff and only ff each rule in P is of one of the following 
forms where A,B,C~N-{S}, feF, aeT, S--,a, ff 6~ 
L(G), 
(a) A--,BC, (b)A-BfC, (c) A-+BCf, 
(d) Af--)BC, (e)Af--,a, (0 A->a 
The question whether the class of languages generated 
by DI-CNF grammars i  a proper or improper subclass 
of the DI-languages will be left open. 
In considering the recognition of DI-CNF grammars 
an extension of the CKY algorithm for CFGs (Kasami, 
1965; Younger, 1967) will be used which is essentially 
365 
inspired by an idea of Vijay-Shanker and Weir in 
(Vijay-Shanker and Weir, 1991). 
Let the n(n+l)/2 cells of a CKY-table for an input 
of length n be indexed by i and j (l~_<j_~.n) in such a 
manner that cell Z i,j builds the top of a pyramid the ba- 
se of which consists-of the input ai...aj. 
As in the case of CFGs a label E of a node of a deri- 
vation tree (or a code of E) should be placed into cell 
Zi, j only if in G the derivation E=*=>ai...a j is valid. 
Since nonterminal nodes of DI-derivation tr6es are la- 
beled by pairs (A,~t) consisting of a nonterminal A and 
an index stack B and since the number of such pairs 
with (AdO =*=> w can grow exponentially with the 
length of w, intractability can only be avoided if index 
stacks can be encoded in such a way that substacks 
shared by several nodes are represented only once. 
Vijay-Shanker and Weir solved the problem for lin- 
ear indexed grammars (LIGs) by storing for each node 
K not its complete label Aflf2...fn, but the nonterminal 
part A together with only the top fl of its index stack 
and an indication of the cell where the label of a de- 
scendant of K can be found with its top index f2 conti- 
nning the stack of its ancestor K. In the following this 
idea will be adopted for DI-grammars, which, however, 
require a supplementation. 
Thus, if the cell Z i ; of the CKY-table contains an 
entry beginning with ~l<A,fl, (B,f2,q,p),..>", then we 
know that 
Att=*=>ai_.a j with tt--fltt 1 eF* 
is valid, and further that the top index symbol f2 on 
Bl(i.e. the continuation of f l )  is in an entry ofceU Zp~q 
beginning with the noterminal B. If, descending in 
such a manner and guided by pointer quadruples like 
"<B,f2,p,q>" , an entry of the form <C,fn,-,..> is met, 
then, in the case of a LIG-table, the bottom of stack 
has been reached. So, entries of the form 
<A,fl,(B,f2,p,q)> are sufficient for LIGs. 
But, of course, in the case of DI-derivatious the bot- 
tom of stack of a node, because of index distribution, 
does not coincide with the bottom of stack of an arbitr- 
ary index inheriting descendant, cf. 
(13) 
LIG-Percolation vs. DI-Percolation 
Aflf2...f n Af l f2. . .~+l. . . f  n

I I ^ 
Df3,..fj I 
I /I 
Cf n (bottom of Cf t t 
I \ stack) / \ (stack continuation) 
Rather, the bottom of stack of a DI-node coincides with 
the bottom of stack of its rightmost index inheriting de- 
scendant. Therefore, the pointer mechanism for DI-en- 
tries has to be more complicated. In particular, it must 
be possible to add an "intersemital" pointer to a sister 
path. However, since the continuation of the unary 
stack (like of Cf t in ( ) )  of a node without index inher- 
iting descendants is necessarily unknown at the time its 
entry is created in a bottom up manner, it must be pos- 
sible to add an intersemital pointer to an entry later on. 
That is why a DI-entry for a node K in a CKY-ceU 
requires an additional pointer to the entry for a descen- 
dant C, which contains the end-of-stack symbol of K 
and which eventually has to be supplemented by an in- 
tersemital continuation pointer. E.g. the entry 
(14) < Bl,f2,(D,f3,p,q),(C,ft,r,s) > in Z i,j 
indicates that the next symbol f3 below f2 on the index 
stack belonging to B 1 can be found in cell ZO q in the 
entry for the nonterminal D; the second ~l{~druple 
(C,f t r,s) points to the descendant C of Blcarrying the 
last ~ndex ft of Bland containing a place where a con- 
tinuation pointer to a neighbouring path can be added 
or has already been added. 
To illustrate the extended CKY-algorithm, one of 
the more complicated cases of specifying an entry for 
the cell Zi, j is added below which dominates most of 
the other cases in time complexity: 
FOR i:=n TO 1 DO 
FORj:=i TO n DO 
FOR k:=i TO j-1 DO 
For each rule A~ AlfA2: 
if <Al,f,(Bl,fl,Ploql),(C 1,f3,sl,tl)>eZi,k 
for some B1, CleN,f l , f3eF, 
Pl, ql (i-<Pl<ql~k), Sl,tl (i-<Pl<Sl-<tl ~&) 
and <A2,fo-,-> eZk+l, j for some fceF 
then 1. if 
<B 1,fl, (B2,f2,P2,q2), X>eZpl,qlfor 
some B2,eN, f2eF, P2, q2 
with i~.p2<q2<_k, and if ql<P2, then 
X=- , else X=(C,f t, u,v) for some 
CEN, fteF, u,v (Pl<UgVg ql) 
then 
Zi,j :=Zi,jw{<A,fl,(B2,f2,P2,q3 ), 
(A2,fok+l,j) >} 
else 
if <Bl,fl,-,-> eLpl ,ql  
Zij:=Zijw{<A, fl,(A~,fc,k+ 1,j), 
(A 2,fc,k + I d)> } 
2. if 
<Cl,f3,-,->?Lsl,tl 
366 
then 
Zsl,tl := 
Zsl,tlw{ <C l,f3,(A 2,fc,k + l j),-> } 
The pointer (A2,fc,k+lj) in the new entry of Zij points 
to the cell of the node where the end of stack of the 
newly created node with noterminal A can be found. 
The same pointer (A2,fc,,k+lj) appears in cell Zsl,t 1 
as "supplement" in order to indicate where the stack of 
A is continued behind the end-of-stack ofA 1. Note that 
supplemented quadruples of a cell Zi, j are uniquely 
identifiable by their form <N,fl,(C,f2,r,s),->, i.e. the 
empty fourth component, and by the relation 
j<_r~s. Supplemented quadruples cannot be used as en- 
tries for daughters of "active" nodes, i.e. nodes the en- 
tries of which are currently being constructed. 
Let al..a n be the input. The number of entries of the 
form <B,fl,(D,f2,p,q),(C,f3,r,s)> (fl,f2,f3eF, B,C, D~ 
N, l<i,p,q,r, sj_~a) in each cell Zi, iwill then be bounded 
by a polynomial of degree 4, i.e ~. O(n4). For a fixed 
value of ij,k, steps like the one above may require 
O(n 8) time (in some cases O(n12)). The three initial 
loops increase the complexity by degree 3.
