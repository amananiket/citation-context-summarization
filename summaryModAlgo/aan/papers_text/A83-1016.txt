ABSTRACT 
This paper Ident i f ies  the types of sentence 
fragments found In the text  of two domains: medical 
records and Navy equipment status messages. The 
fragment types are re lated to fu l l  sentence forms 
on the basis of the elements which were regu lar ly  
deleted. A breakdown of the fragment types and 
the i r  d i s t r ibut ions  In the two domains Is 
presented. An approach to reconstruct ing the 
semantic class of deleted elements In the medical 
records Is proposed which is based on the semantic 
patterns recognized In the domain. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
A large amount of natural language Input, 
whether to text processing or questlon-answerlng 
systems, conslsts of shortened sentence forms, 
sentence nfragmentsn. Sentence fragments are found 
in informal technical communlcatlons, messages, 
headlines, and In te legraphic  camunlcat lons.  
Occurrences are characterized by the l r  brev l ty  and 
Informational nature. In a l l  of these, i f  people 
are not res t r i c ted  to using complete, grammatical 
sentences, as they are In formal wr i t ing  
s i tuat ions ,  they tend to leave OUt the parts of the 
sentence which they bel leve the reader w i l l  be able 
to reconstruct.  Thls is especia l ly  true i f  the 
wr i te r  deals wlth a special ized subject matter 
where the facts are to be used by others in the 
same f ie ld .  
Several approaches to such hi l l - formed,,  
natural language Input have been fol lowed. The 
LIFER system \[Hendrlx, 1977; Hendrlx, et a i . ,  1978\] 
and the I~_ANES system \[Waltz, 1978\] both account 
for fragments In procedural terms; they Co not 
require the user to enumerate the types of 
fragments which w i l l  be accepted. The L ingu is t i c  
Strlng Project has characterlzed the regular ly  
occurring ungrammatical constructions and made them 
pert of the parsing grammar \[Anderson, et e l . ,  
1975; Hlrschman and Sager, 1982\]. Kwasny and 
Sondhe!mer (10R1) have used error-handl ing 
procedures to re late  the I l l - formed input of 
sentence fragments to well-formed structures.  
While these approaches d i f fe r  in the way they 
determine the structure of the fragments and the 
deleted mater ia l ,  for the most pert they rely 
heavi ly,  at some point,  on the recognit ion of 
semantic word-classes. The purpose of th is  paper 
Is to describe the syntact ic  character is t ics  of 
sentence fragments and to l l l us t ra te  how the 
domeln-speclf lc Information embodied In the 
cooCcurrence patterns of the semantic word-classes 
of a domain can be u t i l i zed  as a powerful tool for 
processing a body of compact text ,  I .e.  tex t  that  
contains a large percentage of sentence fragments, 
I I .  IDENTIFICATION OF FRAGMENT TYPES 
The Nee York Unlversl~y L ingu is t i c  Str ing 
Project  has developed a computer program to analyze 
ccmpact text In special Ized subject areas using a 
general parsing program and an Engl Ish grammar 
augmented by procedures spec l f l c  to  the subJect 
areas. In recent years the system has been 
ta i lo red  for  computer analysis of f ree - text  medical 
records, which are characterized by numerous 
sentence fragments. In the computer-analysis and 
processing of the medical records, re la t lve ly  few 
types of sentence fragments suff lced to describe 
the shortened forlas, a l though such fragments 
ccmprfsed fu l l y  49% of the natural language input 
CMarsh and Sager, 1982\]. Fragment types can be 
re lated to fu l l  forms on the basis of the elements 
which are regular ly  delirfed. Elements deleted fr~n 
the fragments are fr~a one or more of the syntact ic  
pos l t lons:  subject,  tense, verb, obJect. The s ix 
fragment types Ident l f led  in the set of medical 
records are shown In Table 1 as types i -V l .  
A feature of fragment types that Is not 
Imed la te ly  obvious ts the fact  that they are 
already known In the ful I grammar as parts of 
ful l e t  construct ions. The fragment types re f lec t  
delet ions found in syntact i ca l l y  dist inguished 
posit ions wlth in fu l l  sentences, as I l l us t ra ted  in 
Table 2. For e~ample, In normal English, a sentence 
that contains tense and the verb be can occur as 
the object  of verbs l i ke  f ind (e.g. She found that 
the sent~ce was ~ ) .  In the same 
environment, as obJect of f ind,  a reduced sentence 
can occur \[n which the tense and verb be have been 
omitted, as In fragment type I (e.g. She found the 
sentence ~ l l l J ;~) .  In the same manner, other 
reduced forms ref lected in fragment types also 
represent constructions general ly found as ~arts of 
regular English sentences. 
The fact  that the fragment types can be 
re lated to fu l l  English forms makes I t  possible to 
v Iee thee as Instances of reduced 
SURJECT-VEI~-(~JECT patterns free which par t i cu la r  
components have been deleted. Fragments of type I 
can be represented as having a deleted tense and 
verb be, of type II as having a deleted subject, 
tense, and verb be, etc. This makes it relatively 
stra ightforward to add thee to the parslng grammar,

and, at the same time, provides a framework for  
Ident i fy ing the i r  semantic content by re la t ing  thm 
to the corresponding fu l l  forms. 
The number of fragment types that occur In 
compact text  of d i f fe rent  technical domains appears 
to be re la t lve ly  l imited.  When the fragment types 
found In medical records were compared wlth those 
seen In a smell sample of Navy equipment status 
messages, f i ve  of the s lx  types found in the 
medlcal records were also found In the Navy 
messages. Only one addit ional  fragment type was 
required to cover the Navy messages. This type 
appears In Table I as type Vll, in which two 
subjects have been deleted (Reauest advise 
for Dick ~Q.). 
While the number of fragment types Is 
re la t ive ly  constant, the d i s t r ibut ion  of fragment 
types varies according to the domain of the text .  
Table 3 shows d i s t r ibut ions  for each of the 
fragment types Ident i f ied  in Table 1. For e~ample, 
In Table 3, while fragment type IV, from which 
subject, tense, and verb have been deleted, is most 
frequent In medical records, I t  is a much less 
frequent type In the Navy messages. On the other 
hand, type VI, from whlch a subject has been 
deleted, Is re la t ive ly  Infrequent In medical 
records, but much more frequent in Navy messages. 
In addit ion,  the d i f fe rent  sections of the 
input d i f fe r  with respect to the ra t io  of fragments 
1-o whole sentences and in the types of fro~ments 
101 
they contain. For e~unple, the d i f fe rent  sections 
of the medical records that  were analyzed (e.g. 
HISTORY, EXAM, LAB-DATA, IMPRESSION, COURSE IN 
HOSPITAL) were dist inguished by differences in the 
d i s t r ibut ion  of the fragment types. The EXAM 
paragraph of the medical texts ,  In which the 
physician describes the resu l ts  of the pat ient ' s  
physical  eK~lnat lon ,  contained a relatively large 
number of fragments of type I11, espec ia l ly  
adjective phrases. The COURSE IN HOSPITAL 
paragraph contained a larger number of complete 
sentences than the other paragraphs.

I I I .  RECONSTRUCTION OF DELETIONS 
The de let ions  which re la te  fragment types to  
the i r  fu l l  sentence forms fa l l  Into two main 
classes:  ( I )  those found v i r tua l ly  In a l l  tex ts  and 
I l l )  those spec l f l c  to the domain of the text .  
Just as the fragment types can be viewed as 
Incomplete rea l i za t ions  of syntac-Nc S-V-O 
s t ruc tures ,  the semantic pat terns  In sentence 
fragments can be considered Incomplete rea l l za t lons  
of the semantic S-V-O pat terns .  In general terms, 
the s t ruc ture  of Informat ion In technical  domains 
can be spec i f ied  by a set  of semantlc c lasses,  the 
words and phrases which belong to  these classes,  
and by a spec l f l ca t lon  of the pal'~erns these 
classes enter  in'to, l .e .  the syntact i c  
re la t ionsh ips  among the members of +he classes 
\[Grlshmen, e t  e l . ,  1982; Sager, 1978\]. In +he case 
of the medical sublenguage processed by the 
L lngu ls t l c  StTlng Pro jec t ,  the medical subclasses 
were der lved through techniques of d i s t r ibut iona l  
ana lys is  \[Hlrschmen and Sager, 1982\]. Semantlc 
S-V-O pet-I'erns were then der ived from the 
comblnatory proper t ies  of the medical classes in 
the text  \[Marsh and Sager, 1982\]; +he semantic 
pat~rerns Ident i f ied  In a text  are spec i f i c  to  the 
domain of +he text .  Whlle they serve to formulate  
sublanguage const ra in ts  which ru le  out  incor rec t  
syntact i c  analyses caused by s t ruc tura l  or l ex lca l  
ambiguity/, these re la t ionsh ips  among classes can 
a lso prov ide a means by which deleted elements in 
compact text  can be reconstructed.  When a fragment 
Is recognized as an Instance of a given semantic 
pat tern ,  I t  Is +hen poss ib le  to speci fy  a set  of 
the semantic classes from which the medical 
sublanguage class of +he deleted element can be 
selected.  
On a super f l c la l  l eve l ,  the de le t ions  of be In 
fragment types Ic - f  and I l i a -b ,  for  example, can be 
reconstructed on purely  syntac~'lc grounds by 
f l l l l ng  In the l exical  Item be. However, I t  Is 
a lso poss ib le  to prov ide fu r ther  Informat ion and 
speci fy  the semantic class of the lex lcal Item be 
by reference to the semantlc S-V-O pat-tern 
manifested by the occurr ing subject  and ob jec t .  
For e~emple, In type If fragment skin no ~ruot lons,  
skin has the medical subclass BODYPART, and 
erunt lons  has +he medlcal subclass SIGN/SYMFrrOM. 
The semantic S-V-O pat-tern In which these classes 
play a par t  Is= 
BODYPART-SHOWVERB-SIGN/SYMPTOM 
(as In Skln showed no erunt lons ) .  Be can then be 
assigned the semantic c lass SHOWVERB. p ro te in  ~,  
type I t ,  enters Into the semantic pal-~ern: 
TEST-~STVERB-TES13~ESULT 
and be can be assigned the class TESI~/ERB, which 
re la tes  a TEST sub ject  wl th  a TESllRESULT ob jec t .  
Assigning a semantic c lass to  the reconstructed be 
maximizes I ts  In format ional  content .  
In add i t ion  to  reconst ruct ing  a d l s t lngu lshed  
l ex lca l  Item, l i ke  +he verb be, along with  I ts  
semantic c lasses,  I t  Is a lso  poss ib le  to  spec i fy  
the set  of semantic classes for  a deleted element,  
even +hough a l ex lca l  Item Is not Immediately 
reconst ructab le .  For e~emple, the fragment To 
recelv9 fo l l c  ~,J.~o of Type VI,  conta ins a verb of 
the PI~/ERB" c lass and a MEDICATION-obJect, but the 
sub ject  has b~n de leted.  The only semantic 
pad-tern which permits a verb and ob jec t  wl th  these 
medical subclasses Is the S-V-O pat tern :  
PATIENT-PTVERB-MEDICATION 
Through recogn{t lon  of the semantic pat tern  in 
which +he occurr ing elements of the fragment play a 
ro le ,  the semantic c lass PATIENT can be spec i f ied  
fo r  +he deleted sub ject ,  p~t lent  Is one of the 
d i s t ingu ished  words In the domain of nar ra t ive  
medical records which are o f ten not exp l i c i t l y  
mentloned In the text ,  although they play a ro le  In 
the sementlc pat terns .  
The S-V-O re la t ions ,  of which the fragment 
i~/pes are Incomplete rea l i za t ions ,  form the basis 
of a procedure which spec i f ies  the semantic c lasses 
of de leted elements In fragments. Under the best 
cond i t ions ,  the set  of semantic classes fo r  the 
deleted form conta ins only one element. I t  Is a lso  
poss ib le ,  however, for  the set to conta in  more than 
one semantic c lass.  For example, the t~fpe la 
fragment Pain also noted }n hands ~ knees, when 
regu lar i zed  to normal ac t ive  S-V-O word order  as 
noted oaln In hands and knees, has a de leted 
sub ject .  The set of poss ib le  medical classes for  
the deleted subject  cons ists  of ~PATIENT, FAMILY, 
OocrrOR}, s ince ? fragment wi th  a verb of the 
OBSERVE c lass,  such as note, and an ob jec t  of the 
SIGN/SYMPTOM class,  such as oaln,  can enter  ~rtc 
SUBJECT VERB OBJECT 
FAMILY OBSERVE SIGN/SYMPTOM 
PATIENT OBSERVE SIGN/SYMPTOM 
DOCTOR OBSERVE SIGN/SYMPTOM 
(MO~ ~SERV~ F~ER. ) 
(p_~ OBSFRV~ F~ER.)

any of the S-V-O patterns In F igure I ,  The choice 
of one subclass for  the deleted element from among 
elements of the set of poss ib le  subclasses Is 
dependent on several factors .  F i r s t ,  proper t ies  of 
paragraph s t ructure  of the text  place res t r i c t ions  
on the se lect ion  of semantic class for  a deleted 
element. The fragment noted oaln In  h~ds  and 
knees would se lect  a DOCTOR subject I f  wr i t ten  In 
the IMPRESSION or EXAH paragraph of the text ,  but,  
In the HISTORY paragraph, a PATIENT or FAMILY 
subJect could not be excluded. A second fac tor  Is 
the presence of an antecedent having one of the 
semantic classes spec i f ied fo r  the deleted element. 
I f  a poss ib le  antecedent having the same sGmsntlc 
class can be found, subJect to  res t r l c t lons  on 
change of top ic  and discourse s t ruc ture ,  then the 
deleted element can be f i l l ed  In by Its antecedent, 
res t r i c t ing  the sementlc class of the deleted 
element to that  of the antecedent. Hoaever, an 
antecedent search may not always be successful ,  
s ince the antecedent may not have been exp l l c \ [ t l y  
mentioned In the text .  The antecedent may be one 
of a class of d is t inguished words In the 
sublanguage, such as nat lent  and . ~ ,  which may 
not be previous ly  mentioned In the body of the 
text .  
Thus, semantic patterns der ived from 
d ls t r lbut \ [ona l  analys is  permit  the spec i f i ca t ion  of 
a set of semantic classes for  deleted elements In 
texts  cheracter lzed by a large propor t ion  of 
sentence fragments. This spec l f l ca t lon  can 
fac i l i ta te  the reconstrucf fon of deleted elements 
by l im i t ing  choice among poss ib le  antecedents. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
In th i s  paper, seven de le t ion  patterns found 
In technical  compact text  have been Ident i f ied .  
The number of fragment types Is re la t ive ly  l im i ted .  
F ive of the seven occur In the fu l l  grammar of 
English as subparts of fu l le r  s t ructures .  These 
syntact i c  fragment types can be vlewed as 
Incomplete rea l i za t ions  of syntact i c  
SUBJ ECT-VERB-ORJECT s t ructures ;  the semantic 
patterns In sentence fragments are found to be 
Incomplete rea l l za t lons  of the semantic 
SUBJECT-VER\]-OBJECT pal-ferns found In fu l l  
sentences. Semantic classes can be spec l f led for  
deleted elements In sentence fragments based on 
these semantic patterns.
