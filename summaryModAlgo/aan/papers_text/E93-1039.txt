One source of unnaturalness in the output 
of text-to-speech systems stems from the in- 
volvement of algorithmically generated de- 
fault intonation contours, applied under 
minimal control from syntax and semantics. 
It is a tribute both to the resilience of hu- 
man language understanding and to the in- 
genuity of the inventors of these algorithms 
that the results are as intelligible as they 
are. However, the result is very frequently 
unnatural, and may on occasion mislead the 
hearer. This paper extends earlier work on 
the relation between syntax and intonation 
in language understanding in Combinatory 
Categorial Grammar (CCG). A generator 
with a simple and domain-independent dis- 
course model can be used to direct synthe- 
sis of intonation contours for responses to 
data-base queries, to convey distinctions of 
contrast and emphasis determined by the 
discourse model. 
1 The  Prob lem 
Consider the exchange shown in example (1). Capi- 
tals indicate stress, and brackets informally indicate 
the intonational phrasing. The intonation contour 
is indicated underneath using Pierrehumbert's nota- 
tion (\[8\], \[1\], see \[13\] for a brief summary). L+tt*

and H* are different high pitch accents, and LH% 
and LL% (and its relative L) are rising and low 
boundaries respectively. The other annotations in- 
dicate that the intonational tunes L+H* LH% and 
H* LL% convey two distinct kinds of discourse in- 
formation. First, both pitch accents mark any word 
that they occur on (or rather, its interpretation) for 
"focus", which in the context of such simple queries 
as example (1) usually implies contrast of some kind. 
Second, the tunes as a whole mark the constituent 
that bears them (or rather, its interpretation) as 
having a particular function in the discourse. We 
have argued at length elsewhere that, at least in this 
same restricted class of dialogues, the function of the 
L+H* LH% tune is to mark the "theme" - that is, 
"what the participants have agreed to talk about". 
The H* LL% tune (and its relative the H* L tune) 
mark the "theme" - that is, "what the speaker has 
to say" about the theme. This phenomenon is a 
strong one: the same intonation contour sounds quite 
anomalous in the context of a question that does not 
establish the correct open proposition as the theme, 
such as Which device has the fast processor?. One 
further point is worth noting: the unit that we are 
calling the theme is not in this example a traditional 
syntactic onstituent. Many problems in the analy- 
sis and synthesis of spoken language result from the 
partial independence of syntactic and intonational 
phrase boundaries. 
The architecture ofour system (shown in Figure 1) 
is for the most part self-explanatory, but we note that 
we follow a long tradition in separating the process 
of generation itself into two phases. The "strategic" 
phase is one in which the content of the utterance 
is planned, including the division into theme and 
rheme, and the assignment ofcontrastive focus. The 
"tactical" phase is one in which content is mapped

2 CCG-Based Prosody 
We will assume a standard CCG of the kind dis- 
cussed in \[11\], \[12\], and \[13\]. For example, we shall 
write the category of a transitive verb like prefers 
either abbreviated, as in (2)a, or in full as in (2)b: 
(2) a. (S \NP) /NP  
b. (S : include' z y \NP : y)/NF : z 
In b, syntactic types are paired with a semantic in- 
terpretation via the colon operator, and the category 
is that of a function from NPs (with interpretation 
x) to functions from NPs (with interpretation y) to 
Ss (with interpretation i clude' z y). Constants in 
interpretations bear primes, variables do not, and 
there is a convention of left associativity. 
We also need the following two rules of functional 
application, where X and Y are variables over cate- 
gories in either notation: 
(3) FUNCTIONAL APPLICATION: 
a. x /Y  Y x (>) 
b. Y X\Y => X (<) 
CCG extends this strictly context-free categorial 
base in two respects. First, all arguments, such 
as NPs, bear only type-raised categories, such as 
S/ (S \NP) .  Similarly, all functions into such cate- 
gories, such as determiners, are functions into the 
raised categories, such as (S / (S \NP) ) /N .  For ex- 
ample, subject NPs bear the following category in 
the full notation: 
(4) widgets := S :  s/(S : s \NP : widgets') 
The derivation of a simple transitive sentence ap- 
pears as follows in the abbreviated notation: 1 
(5) Widgets include sprockets 
S/(S\NP) (S\NP)/NP (S\NP)\((S\NP)/Ni a) 
S\~P 
S 
Second, the combinatory rules are extended to in- 
clude functional composition, as well as application. 
The following rule will be relevant below: 
(6) FORWARD COMPOSITION (>B): 
X/Y  Y /Z  ~B X /g  
This rule allows a second syntactic derivation for the 
above sentence, as follows: 2 
(7) Widget a include sprockets 
S/(S\NP) (S\NP)/NP S\(S/NP) 
S/tn ? 
S 
1The reader is encouraged to satisfy themselves 
using the full semantic notation that this deriva- 
tion yields an S with the correct interpretation 
include' sprockets' widgets'. At first glance, it looks as 
though type-raising will expand the lexicon Marmingly. 
One way round this problem is discussed in \[14\]. 
2The reader is again strongly uged to satisfy them- 
selves that the S yielded in the derivation bears the cor- 
rect interpretation. 
333 
The reasons for making this move, which concern 
the grammar of coordinate constructions, the gen- 
eral class of rules from which the composition rule 
is drawn, and the problem of processing in the face 
of such associative rules, are discussed in tile earlier 
papers, and need not concern us here. The point 
for present purposes is that the partition of the sen- 
tence into the object and a non-standard constituent 
S : include' z '  w idge ls ' /NP  : z makes this theory 
structurally and semantically perfectly suited to the 
demands of intonation, as exhibited in example (1). 3 
We can therefore directly incorporate intonational 
constituency in syntax, as follows (cf. \[12\], \[13\], and 
\[15\]). We assign to all constituents an autonomous 
prosodic ategory, expressing their potential for com- 
bination with other prosodic categories. Then we 
lock these two structural systems together via the 
following principle, which says that syntactic and 
prosodic constituency must be isomorphic: 
(S) PROSODIC CONSTITUENT CONDITION: 
Combination of two syntactic categories 
via a syntactic ombinatory rule is only al- 
lowed if their prosodic categories can also 
combine via a prosodic combinatory rule. 
One way to do this is to make the boundaries ar- 
guments and the pitch accents functions over them. 
The boundaries are as follows: 4 
(9) L : -  b : 1 
LL% : -  b : il 
LH% := b : lh 
As in CCG, categories consist of a structural type, 
here b for boundary, and an interpretation, associ- 
ated via a colon. The pitch accents have the follow- 
ing functional types: 5
(10) L+H* := p : lheme/b : lh 
H* := p : rheme/b : l ,  P: rheme/b : l l  
We further assume, following Bird \[2\], that the pres- 
ence of a pitch accent causes ome element(s) in the 
translation of the category to be marked as focussed, 
a matter which we will for simplicity assume occurs 
at the level of the lexicon. For example, when in- 
cludes bears a pitch accent, its category will be as 
follows: 
(11) (S : ( * inc lude ' )xYkNP:y ) /NP :x  
The categories that result from the combination of 
a pitch accent and a boundary may or may not con- 
stitute entire prosodic phrases, since there may be a 
prenuclear null tone. There may also be a null tone 
separating the pitch accent(s) from the boundary. 
aA similar argument in a related categorial framework 
is made by Moortgat \[6\]. 
4These categories slightly depart from Pierrehumbert. 
5 Here we are ignoring the possibility of multiple pitch 
accents in the same prosodic phrase, but cf. \[13\]. 
(Both possibilities are illustrated in (1)). We there- 
fore assign the following category to the null tone, 
which can thereby apply to the right to any non- 
functional category of the form X : Y, and compose 
to their right with any function into such a category, 
including another null tone, to yield the same cate- 
gory: 
(12) 0 := X :Y /X :Y  
It is this omnivorous category that allows intona- 
tional tunes to be spread over arbitrarily large con- 
stituents, since it allows the pitch accent's desire for 
a boundary to propagate via composition into the 
null tone category (see the earlier papers). 
In order to allow the derivation to proceed above 
the level of complete prosodic phrases identifying 
themes and rhemes, we need two unary category- 
changing rules to mark the interpretation a of the 
corresponding grammatical category with that dis- 
course function and change the phonological cate- 
gory, thus: 6 
(13) ~ ::~ 
p : X p/p  
(14) ~, => 
P:X  p 
These rules change the prosodic ategory either to p, 
or to an endocentric function over p. (These types 
capture the fact that the LL% boundary can only 
occur at the end of a sentence, thereby correcting 
an overgeneration i  the version of this theory in 
Steedman \[13\], noted by Bird \[2\]). The fact that p 
is an atom rather than a term of the form X : Y is 
important, since it means that it can combine only 
with another p. This is vital to the preservation of 
the intonation structure/  
The application of the above two rules to a com- 
plete intonational phrase should be thought of as pre- 
cipitating a side-effect whereby a copy of the category 
E is associated with the clause as its theme or rheme. 
(We gloss over details of how themes and rhemes are 
associated with a particular clause, as well as a num- 
ber of further complications arising in sentences with 
more than one theme). 
In \[13\] and \[15\], a related set of rules of which 
the present ones form a subset are shown to be well- 
behaved with a wide range of examples. Example 
(15) gives the derivation for an example related to 
(7) (since the raised object category is not crucial, it 
has been replaced by NP to ease comprehension): s 
Note that it is the identification of the theme and 
8These rules represent both a departure from the ear- 
lier papers and a slight simplification of what is actually 
needed to allow prosodic phrases to combine correctly. 
7The category has the same effect of preventing fur- 
ther composition i to the null tone achieved in the earlier 
papers by a restriction on forward prosodic omposition. 
SNote the focus-marking effect of the pitch accents.

rheme at the stage before the final reduction that de- 
termines the information structure for the response, 
for it is at this point that discourse lements like 
the open proposition are explicit, and can be used in 
semantically-driven sy thesis of intonation contour 
directly from the constituents. 
Of course, such gushingly unambiguous intonation 
contours are comparitively rare in normal dialogues. 
Even in the context given in (7), a more usual re- 
sponse to the question would put low pitch - that is, 
the null tone in Pierrehumbert's erms - on every- 
thing except he focus of the rheme, sprockets, as in 
the following: 
(16) Widgets include SPROCKETS 
Such an utterance is of course ambiguous as to 
whether the theme is widgets or what widgets in- 
clude. The earlier papers show that such "un- 
marked" themes, which include no pitch accent be- 
cause they are entirely background, can be captured 
by a "Null Theme Promotion Rule", as follows: 9 
(17) ~ :E 
X:Y/X:Y ::~ p : theme 
3 Parsing 
Having established the relationship between prosody, 
information structure and CCG syntax, we can now 
address the computational problem of automatically 
directing the synthesis of intonation contours for 
responses to database queries. Our computational 
model (shown in Figure 1) starts with a prosodically 
annotated wh-question given as a string of words 
with associated Pierrehumbert-style pitch accent and 
boundary markings. We employ a simple bottom-up 
shift-reduce parser of the kind presented in \[14\], mak- 
ing direct use of the CCG-Prosody theory described 
above, to identify the semantics of the question. The

inherent in this rule. 
inclusion of prosodic categories in the grammar al- 
lows the parser to identify the information structure 
(theme and theme) within the question as well. The 
focus and background information within the theme 
and theme (if any) is further marked by the focus 
predicate * in the semantic representation. For ex- 
ample, given the question (18) below, the parser pro- 
duces the semantic and information structure repre- 
sentations shown in (19). 1?

The nondeterminism inherent in unmarked themes 
is handled by default: the present implementation 
of Null Theme Promotion delivers the longest un- 
marked theme that the syntax permits. 11 
4 Strategic Generation 
The strategic phase of generating a response is 
somewhat simplified in the current implementation, 
and we have cut a number of corners. In par- 
ticular, we currently assume that the question is 
the sole determinant of the information structure 
in the answer. This is undoubtedly an oversim- 
plification. The complete specification of the se- 
mantic and information structures provided by the 
parser is used by the generator to determine the 
intelligible and prosodically natural response. For 
1?The alert reader will note that the notation for con- 
stants, variables, and functional application is slightly 
changed in these sections, to correspond to the Prolog 
implementation. 
11This is a simplification, but a harmless one for the 
simplified query domains that we are dealing with here. 
335 
a wh-question, the semantic representation corre- 
sponds to a lambda expression in one or more vari- 
ables ranging over individuals in the database, and 
has the structure of a Prolog query which we can 
evaluate to determine the possible instantiations of 
the open proposition. The instantiated proposi- 
tion determines the semantic proposition to be con- 
veyed in the response. For the example above, this 
is part(sprockets)&include( .wodgets,  .sprockets) -
"Wodgets include sprockets". 
Note that the derived semantics includes the neces- 
sary occurrences of the focus predicate *, determined 
as follows. All terms that are focused in the ques- 
tion semantics are focused in the response semantics. 
Intuitively, the instantiated variable in the response 
semantics must also be focused since it represents he 
information which is new in the response. For more 
complex rhemes such as quantified NPs with modi- 
fiers, we focus those elements of the semantic repre- 
sentation that are new in the current context. (That 
is, ones which did not figure in the interpretation 
of the original query). Thus, given a question such 
as (1), we choose to focus the modifier "fast" rather 
than the noun "processor" in the rheme. Similary, 
in the exchange below, we focus "processor" instead 
of "fast" because of its newness in the context. 
(20) Q: What fast component does the widget 
include? 
A: The widget includes a fast PROCES- 
SOR. 
To determine an appropriate intonation contour 
for the utterance, we must further determine the 
appropriate information structure. Fortunately, for 
the simple question-answering task, the information 
structure of the response can be assumed to be com- 
pletely determined by the original query. The theme 
of a question corresponds to "what the question is 
about" - in this case, "parts". The theme of a ques- 
tion corresponds to "what the speaker wants to know 
about the theme" - here, "What wodgets include". 
It follows that we expect the theme of the ques- 
tion to determine the theme of the response. For 
example (18), the theme of the response should be 
S : include(.wodgets,  x ) /NP  : x, as in (21) below. 
Note that we simplify the strategic generation prob- 
lem by including the syntactic ategory in our repre- 
sention of the theme (as determined by the syntac- 
tic category of the theme of the original question)) 2 
Given the syntactic and semantic representation of
the theme of the response, the CCG combination 
rules can easily be invoked to determine the theme of 
the response. The rheme is simply the complement 
12Here we are cutting another corner: the theme, and 
hence the rheme, are fully specified syntactically, as well 
as semantically, as a result of the analysis of the question: 
in a more general system, we would presumably need to 
specify syntactic type from scratch, starting from pure 
semantics. 
of the theme with respect o the overall semantics of 
the response, as in (21) below, obtained by instan- 
tiating the result and one input of the appropriate 
combinatory rule (cf. \[7\]): la

5 Tact i ca l  Generat ion  and  CCG 
Just as the shift-reduce parser sketched above can 
readily be made to construct he interpretations and 
information structures shown in the examples, specif- 
ically marking themes, rhemes and their foci, so it is 
relatively easy to do the reverse---to generate pro- 
sidically annotated strings from a focus-marked se- 
mantic representation f themes and rhemes. 
For simplicity, we start by describing the syntac- 
tic and semantic aspects of the generator, ignoring 
prosody for the moment. In constructing a tactical 
generation schema, several design options are avail- 
able, including bottom-up, top-down and semantic 
head-driven models (\[3\], \[10\]). We adopt a hybrid 
approach, employing a basic top-down strategy that 
takes advantage of the CCG notion of "functional 
head" to avoid fruitless search. While this tech- 
nique exhibits some inefficiencies characteristic of a 
depth-first search, it has several significant advan- 
tages. First, it does not rely on a specific seman- 
tic representation, and requires only that the seman- 
tics be compositional and representable in Prolog. 
Thus the generating procedure is independent of the 
particular grammar. This modular character of the 
system has been very useful in developing the com- 
petence grammar proposed in the preceding section, 
and offers a basis for proving the completeness of 
the implementation with respect o the competence 
theory. 
The tactical generation program is written in Pro- 
log, and works as follows. Starting with a syntactic 
constituent (initially s) and a semantic formula, we 
utilize the CCG reduction rules to determine possible 
subconstituents hat can combine to yield the orig- 
inal constituent, invoking the generator ecursively 
to generate the proposed subconstituents. The base 
case of the recursion occurs when a category we wish 
to generate unifies with a category in the lexicon. 
For example, suppose we wish to generate an utter- 
ance corresponding to the category s:walks'(mary'). 
Since the given category does not unify with any cat- 
egory in the lexicon, the program proposes possible 
subconstituents by checking the CCG combination 
rules in some pre-determined order. By the back- 
ward function application rule, we might hypothe- 
size that the categories x and s:walks'(mary') \z are 
the subconstituents of s:walks'(mary'), where x is 
13Again the example is simplified by the use of a non- 
raised category for the object.

RESULT: the new widgetQlhstar contains@lhb. 
some variable. If we recursively call the generator 
on s:walks'(mary')kx, we find that it unifies with 
the category s:walks'(y}knp:y in the lexicon, corre- 
sponding to the lexical item walks. This unification 
forces the complementary category z to unify with 
np:mary', which yields the lexical item mary when 
the generator is recursively invoked. Concatenat- 
ing the results of generating the proposed subcon- 
stituents therefore gives the string "Mary walks." 
The top-down nature of the generation scheme 
has a number of important consequences. First, 
the order in which we generate the postulated 
subconstituents determines whether the generation 
succeeds. Had we chosen to generate x before 
s:walks'(mary'}kx, we would have entered a poten- 
tially infinite recursion, since x unifies with every 
category in the lexicon. For this reason, our gener- 
ator always chooses to recursively generate the sub- 
constituent that acts as the functional head before 
the subconstituent that acts as the argument under 
the CCG combinatory rules. By strictly observing 
this principle, we ensure that as much semantic infor- 
mation as possible is deployed, thereby constraining 
the search space by prohibiting spurious unifications 
with incorrect items in the lexicon. For this reason, 
we refer to our generation scheme as a "functional 
head"-driven, top-down approach. 
One disadvantage of the top-down generation tech- 
nique is its susceptibility to the non-termination 
problem. If a given path through the search space 
does not lead to unification with an item in the 
lexicon, some condition which aborts the path in 
question at some search depth must be imposed. 
Note that whenever the CCG function application 
rules are used to propose possible subconstituents to 
be recursively generated, the subconstituent acting 
as the functional head has one more curried argu- 
ment than its parent. Since we know that in En- 
glish there is a limit to the number of arguments 
that a functional category can take, we can abort 
fruitless search paths by imposing a limit on the 
number of curried arguments that a CCG category 
can possess. The current implementation allows 
categories with up to three arguments, the mini- 
mum needed for constructions involving di-transitive 
verbs. Note that this strategy does not prohibit 
the generation of categories whose arguments hem- 
selves are complex categories. Thus, we allow cat- 
egories such as ((s\np)/np)\(((s\np)/np)/np) for 
raised indirect objects, but not categories such as 
(((s\ np}/np)/np)/np. 
When the CCG composition rule is used to pro- 
pose possible subconstituents, the subconstituents 
do not have more curried arguments han their par- 
ent. Consequently, imposing a bound of the type 
described above will not necessarily avoid endless re- 
cursion in all cases. Suppose, for example that we 
wish to generate a category of the form s/x, where s 
is a fully instantiated expression and x is a variable. 
If the function application rules fail to produce sub- 
constituents hat generate the category, we rely on 
the CCG composition rule to propose the possible 
subconstituents s/y and y/x. Since s/x and s/y are 
identical categories to within renaming of variables, 
the recursion will continue indefinitely. We rectify 
this situation by invoking the composition rule only 
337 
if the original category has an instantiation for both 
its argument and result. Such a solution imposes 
limitations on the types of derivations allowed by the 
system, but retains the simplicity and transparency 
of the algorithm. Merely imposing a limit on the 
depth of the recursion provides a more general solu- 
tion. Examples of the types of sentences that can be 
generated appear in (22) and (23). 
This procedure can immediately be applied to the 
prosodically augmented grammar. To do so, we 
merely enforce the Prosodic Constituent Condition 
at each step in the generation. That is, whenever 
a pair of subconstituents are considered (by revers- 
ing the CCG combination rules), a pair of prosodic 
subconstituents are also considered and recursively 
generated using the prosodic ombinatory ules. Ex- 
amples (24) and (25) illustrate the generation of in- 
tonation for the theme and theme of the utterance 
"The NEW widget probably contains the FASTEST 
processor" .14 Examples (26) and (27) manifest the 
intonational results of moving the thematic focus 
among the various propositions in the semantic rep- 
resentation of the theme "The new widget probably 
contains... "
6 Synthesis 
We showed in the previous ection how constituents 
of the type shown in (21) can generate intonation- 
ally annotated strings. The resulting string for 
the current example is "wodgets@lhstar include@lhb 
sprockets@\[hstar, llb\]." The final aspect of gener- 
ation involves translating such a string into a form 
usable by a suitable speech synthesiser. Currently, 
we use the Bell Laboratories ITS  system (\[5\]) as a 
post-processor to synthesise the speech wave. Ex- 
ample (28) shows the translated output for the same 
example, as it is sent to this synthesiser.

We stress that we use TTS as an unmodified output 
device, without any fine tuning other than in the 
lexicon. While TTS is particularly easy to use with 
Pierrehumbert's notation, we are confident that our 
system can easily be adapted to other synthesisers.

The system just described produces sharp and 
natural-sounding distinctions of intonation contour 
in minimal pairs of queries like the following: 
14The ~ symbol separates yntactic ategories from 
their corresponding prosodic ategories and lexical items 
from their pitch/boundary markings.

Examples (29) and (30) illustrate the ability of our 
system to produce appropriately different intonation 
contours for identical strings of words depending on 
the context, which determines the information struc- 
ture of the response..If the responses in these ex- 
amples are interchanged, the result sounds distinctly 
338 
unnatural in the given contexts. From examples (31) 
and (32), it will be apparent hat our system has 
the ability to make distinctions in focus placement 
within themes and rhemes based on context. The 
issue of focus placement can be crucial in more com- 
plex themes and rhemes, as shown below:

As noted earlier, such precisely specified themes 
are uncommon in normal dialogue. Consequently, 
the Null Tone Promotion rule is employed for un- 
marked themes, allowing the types of responses in 
(36) and (37) below. The theme is taken to be the 
longest possible prosodically unmarked constituent 
allowed by the syntax.

Although we have only briefly discussed the pos- 
sibility of multiple pitch accents within a theme or 
rheme, we have included such a capability in our im- 
plementation. The system's ability to handle multi- 
ple pitch accents is illustrated by the following ex- 
ample.

While many important problems remain, exam- 
ples like these show that it is possible to produce 
synthesized speech with contextually appropriate in- 
tonational contours using a combinatory theory of 
prosody and information structure that is completely 
transparent to syntax and semantics. The model 
of utterance generation for Combinatory Categorial 
Grammars presented here implements the prosodic 
theory in a similarly transparent and straightforward 
manner.
