Abstract  
This paper proposes machine learning 
techniques, which help disambiguate word 
meaning. These methods focus on considering 
the relationship between a word and its 
surroundings, described as context information 
in the paper. Context information is produced 
from rule-based translation such as part-of-
speech tags, semantic concept, case relations and 
so on. To automatically extract the context 
information, we apply machine learning 
algorithms which are C4.5, C4.5rule and 
RIPPER. In this paper, we test on ParSit, which 
is an interlingual-based machine translation for 
English to Thai. To evaluate our approach, an 
verb-to-be is selected because it has increased in 
frequency and it is quite difficult to be translated 
into Thai by using only linguistic rules. The 
result shows that the accuracy of C4.5, C4.5rule 
and RIPPER are 77.7%, 73.1% and 76.1% 
respectively whereas ParSit give accuracy only 
48%.  
Introduction 
Machine translation has been developed for 
many decades. Many approaches have been 
proposed such as rule-based, statistic-based [5], 
and example-based approaches [3, 6, 11]. 
However, there is no machine learning technique 
that meets human?s requirement. Each technique 
has its own advantages and disadvantages. 
Statistic-based, example-based and corpus-based 
approaches were recently proposed. A rule-
based approach is the first strategy pursued by 
research in the field of machine translation. 
Rules are written from linguistic knowledge by 
human. The strength is that it can deeply analyze 
in both syntax and semantic levels. However, the 
weak points of this model are 1) it requires much 
linguistic knowledge. 2) it is impossible to write 
rules that cover all a language. In many years 
ago, a statistic-based and an example-based were 
proposed. These approaches do not require 
linguistic knowledge, but they need large size of 
bilingual corpus. A statistic-based approach uses 
statistic of bilingual corpus and language model. 
The advantage is that it may be able to produce 
suitable translations even if a given sentence is 
not similar to any sentences in a training corpus. 
In contrast, an example-based can produce 
appropriate translations in case of a given 
sentence must similar to any sentences in a 
training data. Nevertheless, a statistic-based 
approach cannot translate idioms and phrases 
that reflect long-distance dependency. 
To improve quality of a rule-based 
machine translation, we have to modify/add 
some generation rules or analysis rules. This 
method requires much linguistic knowledge and 
we cannot guarantee that accuracy will be better. 
For example, in case of modifying some rules, it 
does not only change incorrect sentences to 
correct sentences furthermore they may effect on 
correct sentences too. The common errors of 
machine translation can be classified into two 
main groups. One is choosing incorrect meaning 
and the other is incorrect ordering. In our 
experiments, we select ParSit in evaluation. 
ParSit is English-to-Thai machine translation by 
using an interlingual-based approach [8]. An 
interlingual-based approach is a kind of rule-
based machine translation. The statistics of 
incorrect meaning and incorrect ordering in 
ParSit are 81.74% and 18.26% respectively. 
Therefore, in this paper, we address on choosing 
a correct meaning. We use context information, 
words and part-of-speech tags, in classifying the 
correct meaning. This paper, we apply machine 
learning algorithms, C4.5, C4.5rule, and 
RIPPER, to automatically extract words and 
part-of-speech tags.  
We develop a computer system for sentence translation 
Syntax & Semantic analysis for English
 Parsit 
1. A Rule-Based Approach: Case Study 
ParSit: English to Thai Machine 
Translation. develop agent proposeobject In this section, we will briefly describe a rule-
based machine translation. Each rule-based 
machine translation has its own mythology in 
translation. Hence in this paper, we select ParSit 
as a case study. ParSit is English to Thai 
machine translation using an interlingual-based 
approach. ParSit consists of four modules that 
are a syntax analysis module, a semantic 
analysis module, a semantic generation module, 
and a syntax generation module. An example of 
ParSit translation is shown in figure 1.

Syntax & Semantic generation for Thai
 In figure 1, the English sentence, ?We 
develop a computer system for sentence 
translation.?, input into ParSit. Both syntax and 
semantic analysis modules analyze the sentence 
and then transform into the interlingual tree 
which is shown in Figure 1. In the interlingual 
tree shows the relationship between words such 
as 1) ?We? is an agent of ?develop? 2) ?system? 
is an object of ?develop? 3)  ?computer? is 
modifier of  ?system? and so on. Finally, Thai 
sentence, ?????????????????????????????????????
??????, is generated from the interlingual tree 
by the syntax and semantic generation modules. 
?????? ????? ???? ??????????? ????? ?????? ??????

This is the house in which she lives. 
Incorrect: ?????????????????????????????????? 
Correct:  ????????????????????????? 
 
o Using an incorrect word. 
The news that she died was a great 
shock. 
 The errors of translation from ParSit can 
be classified into two main groups. One is 
incorrect meaning and the other is incorrect 
ordering. The incorrect meaning also can be 
reclassified into three categories; 1). missing 
some words 2). generating over words 3). using 
incorrect word The examples of errors are 
shown below. 
Incorrect: ??????????????????????????????
???????? 
Correct:  ?????????????????????????????????
???????? 
 
 ? Incorrect ordering errors. ? Incorrect meaning errors. He is wrong to leave. 
o Missing some words. Incorrect: ?????????????? 
The city is not far from here 
Correct:     ?????????????? Incorrect: ?????????????????  
 Correct:      ????????????????????? 
   
We evaluated ParSit by using 770-
English-sentence corpus that is designed by 
Japan Electronic Industry Development 
Association (JEIDA). This corpus has the 
characteristics for testing in word level such 
as concept mismatching, word absence and 
etc. and sentence level such as grammar and 
modifier misplacement. The statistics of 
ParSit errors are shown in Table 1. 
 
 Table 1. Statistics of ParSit Error 
Incorrect meaning errors 
M (%) G (%) U (%) 
Incorrect ordering

16.71 13.31 51.42 18.26 
 
In table 1, M, G and U mean missing 
some word errors, generating over word errors 
and using incorrect word errors respectively. 
According to Table 1, ParSit makes many 
errors in choosing incorrect meaning (81.74%). 
In this paper, we focus on solving the problem 
of choosing incorrect meaning. To decide what 
is the correct meaning of a word, we propose to 
use context information around that word. 
Context information that we use will be 
described in the next section.  
2 Applying Machine Learning Technique 
2.1  Context Information 
There are many kinds of context information 
that useful to decide the appropriate meaning of 
a word such as grammatical rules, collocation 
words, context words, semantic concept and etc. 
Context information is derived from a rule-base 
machine translation. Words and their part-of-
speech tags are the simplest information, which 
are produced from English analysis module. In 
this paper, we use words and/or part-of-speech 
tags around a target word in deciding a word 
meaning. 
2.2 Machine Learning  
In this section, we will briefly descript three 
machine leaning techniques, C4.5, C4.5rule and 
RIPPER. 
2.2.1 C4.5 & C4.5Rule 
C4.5, decision tree, is a traditional classifying 
technique that proposed by Quinlan [7]. C4.5 
have been successfully applied in many NLP 
problems such as word extraction [9] and 
sentence boundary disambiguation [2]. So in this 
paper, we employ C4.5 in our experiments. 
The induction algorithm proceeds by 
evaluation content of series of attributes and 
iteratively building a tree from the attribute 
values with the leaves of the decision tree being 
the valued of the goal attribute. At each step of 
learning procedure, the evolving tree is branched 
on the attribute that partitions the data items 
with the highest information gain. Branches will 
be added until all items in the training set are 
classified. To reduce the effect of overfitting, 
C4.5 prunes the entire decision tree constructed. 
It recursively examines each subtree to 
determine whether replacing it with a leaf or 
branch would reduce expected error rate. This 
pruning makes the decision tree better in dealing 
with the data different from training data. 
In C4.5 version 8, it provides the other 
technique, which is extended from C4.5 called 
C4.5rule. C4.5rule extracts production rules 
from an unpruned decision tree produced by 
C4.5, and then improves process by greedily 
deletes or adds single rules in an effort to reduce 
description length. So in this paper we also 
employ both techniques of C4.5 and C4.5rule. 
2.2.2 RIPPER 
RIPPER [10] is the one of the famous machine 
learning techniques applying in NLP problems 
[4], which was  proprosed by William W. 
Cohen. On his experiment [10] shows that 
RIPPER is more efficient than C4.5 on noisy 
data and it scales nearly linearly with the 
number of examples in a dataset. So we decide 
to choose RIPPER in evaluating and comparing 
results with C4.5 and C4.5rule. 
RIPPER is a propositional rule learning 
algorithm that constructs a ruleset which 
classifies the training data [11]. A rule in the 
constructed ruleset is represented in the form of 
a conjunction of conditions:  
if T1 and T2 and ... Tn then class Cx. 
T1 and T2 and ... Tn is called the body of the rule. 
Cx is a target class to be learned; it can be a 
positive or negative class. A condition Ti tests 
for a particular value of an attribute, and it takes 
one of four forms: An = v,  Ac ? ?, Ac ? ?  and  v

Input sentence In this section, we will describe the process of 
our system in Figure 2. First, input a source 
sentence into rule-based MT and then use syntax 
and semantic rules for analysing the sentence. At 
this step, rule-based MT gives various kinds of 
word information. In this experiment we used 
only words and part-of-speech tags. After 
analysing, rule-based MT generates a sentence 
into target language. Next, the translated 
sentence from rule-based MT and the context 
information are parsed into machine learning. 
Machine learning requires a rule set or a 
decision tree, which are generated from a 
training set, to decide what is the appropriate 
meaning of a word. 
 In training module (Figure 3), we parse 
English sentences with part-of-speech tags, 
which are given by ParSit, and assign the correct 
meaning by linguists into machine learning 
module. The machine learning will learn and 
produces a rule set or a decision tree for 
disambiguating word meaning. The process of 
training is shown in Figure 3. 
 
4 Preliminary Experiments & Results. 
 
To evaluate our approach, we should test on a 
word, which frequently occurred in normal text 
and has several meanings. According to the 
statistics of word usage from 100M-word British 
National Corpus, verb-to-be occurred more than 
thee million times, and translation of verb-to-be  
into Thai is quite difficult by using only 
linguistic rules. Therefore our experiment, we 
test our approach on verb-to-be. 
? As, where An is a nominal attribute and v is a 
legal value for An; or Ac is a continuous variable 
and ? is some value for Ac that occurs in the 
training data; or As is a set-value attribute and v 
is a value that is an element of As. In fact, a 
condition can include negation. A set-valued 
attribute is an attribute whose value is a set of 
strings. The primitive tests on a set-valued 
attribute As are of the form ?v ? As?. When 
constructing a rule, RIPPER finds the test that 
maximizes information gain for a set of 
examples S efficiently, making only a single 
pass over S for each attribute. All symbols v, that 
appear as elements of attribute A for some 
training examples, are considered by RIPPER. 
Figure 3 : The training module 
 In the experiment, we use 3,200 English 
sentences from Japan Electronic Dictionary 
Research Institute (EDR). EDR corpus is 
collected from news, novel and journal. Then 
our linguists manually assigned the suitable 
meaning of verb-to-be in Thai. In training and 
testing steps, we divided data into two groups. 
The first is 700 sentences for testing and the 
other is for training. We use various sizes of a 
training data set and different sizes of context 
information.  
 Table 2, 3 and 4 are the result from 
C4.5, C4.5rule and RIPPER respectively. The 
series in columns represent the number of 
training sentences. The row headers show the 
types of context information that Pos?n, 
Word?n and P&W?n mean part-of-speech tags, 
words and part-of-speech tags and words with 
the window size is n.

According to the result from C4.5 in 
Table 2, with data size is not more than 500 
sentences, C4.5 makes good accuracy by using 
only part-of-speech tags with any window sizes. 
In case of a training data set is equal or more 
than 1000 sentences, considering only words 
give the best accuracy and the suitable window 
size is depend on the size of training data set. In 
Table 3, C4.5rule gives high accuracies on 
considering only part-of-speech tags with any 
window sizes. In table 4, RIPPER produces high 
accuracies by investigating only one word and 
one part-of-speech tag before and after verb-to-
be words. 
Conclusion 
C4.5, C4.5rule and RIPPER have efficiency in 
extracting context information from a training 
corpus. The accuracy of these three machine 
learning techniques is not quite different, and 
RIPPER gives the better results than C4.5 and 
C4.5rule do in a small train set. The appropriate 
context information depends on machine 
learning algorithms. The suitable context 
information giving high accuracy in C4.5, 
C4.5rule and RIPPER are ?3 words around a 
target word, part-of-speech tags with any 
window sizes and ?1 word and part-of-speech 
tag respectively 
This can prove that our approach has a 
significant in improving a quality of translation. 
The advantages of our method are 1) adaptive 
model, 2) it can apply to another languages, and 
3). It is not require linguistic knowledge.  
In future experiment, we will include 
other machine learning techniques such as 
Winnow[1] and increase other context 
information such as semantic, grammar.
