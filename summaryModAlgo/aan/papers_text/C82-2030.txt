WHY THERE MUST BE A SEMANTIC REPRESENTATION (OVER AND ABOVE 
ANY COG~TIVE ~ETWORK)

A s~nant ic  representat ion  (or  a semantic  network;  Me l ' -  
~uk, Seuren,  Hofmann, Sga l l ,  . . . )  cannot be d ispensed wi th  in  
a model of  language comprehension which incorporates  a re -  
p resentat ion  of  knowledge, commonly ca l led  a oo~i t ive  net -  
work (e .g .  Qu?11ian, Lamb, Shank, Hays, Jackendof f ,  . . . ) .  
We sha l l  demonstrate  th i s  in  severa l  ways, c la iming  to  re -  
so lve  the content ion  between those WhO c la im they are necess -  
ary  ( the  1st camp above) and those who would o ls /m that  they  
can be d ispensed w i th ,  the 2nd oemp, inc lud ing  a l so  Hontague, 
who uses them for "conven ience  on ly" .  
F i r s t ,  and most in tu i t i ve ly ,  i s  the  observat ion  that  
.h i  can and commonly does understand a descr ip t ion  of  some- 
th ing  (e .g .  a sc ient i f i c  theory ,  or  a po l i t i ca l  t rac t )  which 
one knows or  be l ieves  to be at  var iance  wi th  the  fac ts .  This 
suggests  that  in - taken  in fo rmat ion  i s  kept apar t  from genera l  
knowledge, unt i l  such t ime as one dec ides  to  accept  i t  aa 
t rue .  Cogn i t ive  networks can, however,  be augmented to  account 
fo r  th i s  by annotat ing  arcs  by the i r  (episteeLic)  source ,  
though th i s  i s  a b i t  unrea l i s t i c  fo r  most human use o f  langu-  
age - we seldom know the source  of  some be l ieved  fac t .  
A 2nd demonst ra t ion  i s  to  note  that  the norms~ person 
"knows" o f  many d i f fe rent  wor lds ,  where fac ts  are  at  var ian -  
ce w i th  those  of  an o ther  wor ld .  As a sc ient i f i c  example, 
Riemsnian and Euc led ian  geometr ies  are  such cont rary  wor lds ,  
- 134  - 
as are any pa i r  of  compet~ theor ies .  For  more ord inary  
examples, most Eng l i sh  speakers  know of at  leas t  4 d i f fe rent  
wor lds ,  conta?ning d i f fe rent  ob jec ts ,  d i f fe rent  poss ib i l i t i es ,  
and so on: the world of  @reek mytho lo~ (conta4nLng un icorns ,  
gods, e tc . ) ,  the  wor ld of  Sher lock  Holmes (wi th  a cer ta in  Dr 
Watson, a Baker S t ,  . . . ) ,  the wor ld of  James Bond, and the  
" rea l "  wor ld.  As fo r  the rea l  wor ld ,  one 's  in ter locutor  o f ten  
has a d i f fe rent  vers ion  of i t ,  which must be known to  under -  
s tand h is  speech.  
Now, i f  one must incorporate  in  h imse l f  knowledEe of  4 
or  so d?st inot  worlds (and I would suggest  i t  i s  c loser  to  40 
than 4) ,  then we may say he has as me~y cogn i t ive  networks,  
of  v~dus  degrees  of  d ete?1 and completeness .  These networks 
may be represented  as conf la ted  in to  one super  cogn i t ive  net r  
work, wi th su f f i c ient  spec ia l  marking o f  the type eu~ested  
above (extended to  nodes,  a l so ) ,  but such a oonf la ted  network 
can always be decomposed in to  separate  ones fo r  the venous  
wor lds ,  i f  i t  i s  adequate ly  marked to  model human behawlour.  
I f  then there  are a number of  d i s t inc t  cogn i t ive  net -  
works needed fo r  unders tand ing  ord inary  human speech,  there  
i s  no reason  not  to  add 1 more fo r  the  conversat ion  cur rent ly  
in  p rogress .  This i s  no more nor less  than a semant ic  repres -  
entat ion ,  except as we sha l l  observe below, i t  d i f fe rs  in  
s t ruc ture ,  and funct ion .  
A t ighter ,  but longer  and more d i f f i cu l t ,  demonst ra t ion  
i s  tO show that  " in fe renc ing" ,  which i s  rough ly  equ iva lent  to  
moving through a cogn i t ive  network,  i s  NOT undertaken unt i l  
the sem~utio operat ion  of  in tegrat ion  i s  a t tempted .  This 
operat ion ,  which combines the semant ic  cont r ibut ions  of  
sentences  together ,  depends heav i ly  on a pr inc ip le  whereby 
each success ive  sentence i s  in terpreted  in  the most redundant 
way poss ib le ,  so that  i t  "over laps"  as much as poss ib le  wi th  
the content  of the prev ious  sentences .  
- 135 - 
t~ 
With th i s  p r inc ip le ,  we can show that  in fe renc ing  
appears to be undertaken only  when in tegrat ion  i s  b locked fo r  
lack  of  aver lap  of  the expressed meanings of  the component 
sentences .  ( In fe renc ing  i s  of  course requ i red  fo r  argument,  
fo r  determ, tnAng t ru th  of  an asser t ion ,  or fo r  o therw ise  app ly -  
ing  the comprehension of a language act  aga ins t  the wor ld . )  
These "expressed  meanings of  the  d i scourse"  are  noth ing  more 
than the i r  sen~nt ic  representat ion ,  ld~ich we have thus shown 
to  b9 necessar i l y  he ld  d i s t inc t  from background knowledge 
used in  ln fe reno ing ,  represented  in  a cogn i t ive  network.  
We can conc lude,  then ,  that  in  some form or  o ther ,  a 
representat ion  of the semantic  e f fec ts  of  the  sentences  i s  
needed to account fo r  how d iscourses  are unders tood .  Al though 
th i s  semant ic  representat ion  me~ be conf la ted  ( in  a computer,  
e .g . )  w i th  a co~j~it ive network,  i t  i s  l og ica l ly  d i s t inc t ,  
and may be pro f i tab ly  so - t reated .  
This sems~utic representat ion ,  we may observe ,  i s  d i s t -  
inc t  from the ord inary  cogn i t ive  network in  being ext remely  
undeta i~ea  conta ih ing  most ly  syntagmat ic  ra ther  than pars -  
d l~nat lo  re la t io f i sh ips ,  and very  ma l leab le ,  and i t  has a 
pr iva ' ledged pos i t ion  in  the in terpreta t ion  of  language acts .  
I t  i s  a l so  used pri~ns~rily, at  speech t ime,  as a depos i to ry ,  
w i th  perhaps no in fe renc i~,  whi le a co~l i t i ve  network as 
genera l ly  understood rece ives  perhaps, noth ing  at  speech t ime,  
but ie  used pr imar i l y  fo r  in fe renc ing .  Thus they  appear to  be 
qu i te  d i s t inc t  in  contents ,  funct ion  and usage.
