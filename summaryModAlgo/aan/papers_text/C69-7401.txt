Mar t in  Minow, KVAL Group.  S tockho lm 
In read ing  through the var ious  prepr in ts ,  I was s t ruck  by the fact that  
many  were  concerned  with spec i f i c  computer  imp lementat ions  of one k ind 
or another .  Unfor tunate ly ,  there  seems to be l i t t le  d i scuss ion  of the program-  
ing f rom the programmer 's  v iewpoint .  Th is  is  under  s tandab le  in a congress  
of computat iona l  l i ngu is t i cs  but,  I fee l ,  somewhat  regret tab le .  Espec ia l l y  
nce the repor ts  of what  has  a l ready  been done sure ly  wil l  s t imu la te  other  
r t i c ipants  to use  computers .  I th ink  that an in fo rmal  sess ion  on program-  
ming  in computat iona l  l i ngu is t i cs  would be both in teres t ing  and va luab le ,  
a l lowing an exchange of ideas  and exper iences  which would be much more  
di f f icu l t  in the even  more  in fo rmal  a tmosphere  of the dining room.  
In o rder  to in i t iate  such  a sess ion ,  I am enc los ing  the fol lowing quest ions ,  
hoping that they will s t imu la te  a cer ta in  in fo rmal  cor respondence  be fore  the 
congress  beg ins .  If enough in teres t  is  shown in th is  idea to war rant  a sess ion ,  
I in tend to edit the rep l ies  rece ived  (to the extent  they  show s imi la r i t ies ) ,  
mak ing  summar ies  ava i lab le  to par t i c ipants  be fore  the conference .  
In answer ing  the quest ions ,  it is  of course  not necessary  to conf ine your -  
se l f  to the par t i cu la r  p ro jec t  you are  d i scuss ing  at the conference  if  another  
p ro jec t  wil l  y ie ld a more  in teres t ing  rep ly .  Th is  is  not, in o ther  words ,  a 
f inal  examinat ion .

Someth ing  e l se  or  more  than  one area  
One- t ime run  or cont inuous  product ion  
~mt  language (mach ine ,  etc) was  used?  (P lease  note that  when I say  language 
I rea l ly  mean language ? haxdware  ? sys tem. )  
Was batch  process ing ,  t ime shar ing ,  or conversat ion  used?  
Why th i s  cho ice?  Were  o ther  languages  ava i lab le?  Su i tab le?  
How did the choice of language in f luence  the def in i t ion of the prob lem? the pro -  
g r axnming ? 
About  how much t ime ( th ink ing,  phys ica l ,  mach ine)  was  requ i red  for - and how 
did the  choice of language  in f luence - the fol lowing:

How la rge  is the program in source  fo rm? What percent  commentary?  
If you used time sharing, did it help? 
How did the software "bureaucracy" (for example, Job Control Language on th~ 
IBIVt 360) af fect  the programming  for better  or worse?  
Can the program be eas i l y  imp lemented  on a d i f ferent  mach ine  or sys tem? 
(Was th is  one of the ob jec t ives? )  If th i s  was t r ied ,  how painful  was the exper ience  
of t rans fer r ing  the program? 
If you were to s ta r t  all over again,  would you use the same language? 
Have you been teach ing programming  to l ingu is t i cs  s tudents?  If so, what has  been 
the i r  exper ience?  Yours?  Should l ingu is ts  learn  programming?  Why? 
KVAL- is  beginning to plan a fa i r ly  la rge  computer  sys tem for t rans la t ion  
f rom Swedish to "condensed"  Bra i l l e .  Th is  requ i res  a la rge  d ict ionary,  fa i r ly  
soph is t i ca ted  character  manipu lat ion  rout ines ,  and the abi l i ty to per fo rm pure ly  
l ingu is t i c  operat ions  on the input text (to recogn ize  sy l lab les ,  morphemes ,  etc).  
Addit ional ly ,  the input-output  p rob lems are  not at al l  t r iv ia l .  We a lso  want to 
p roduce  a sys temwhich  can be moved eas i ly  - both to d i f ferent  computers  with in  
Sweden, and  even,  i f  poss ib le ,  to other  languages ,  The program should a lso  b O 
se l f -document ing  and permi t  easy  modi f icat ion in a modu lar  fash ion as new words,  
new syntact ic  t rans format ions ,  etc p rove  usefu l .  It would a lso  be nice if the  
" l ingu is t i c  work" could be wr i t ten by l ingu is ts  with only a l i t t le p rogramming  
t ra in ing ,  ra ther  than the other  way around.  We wou ldn ' t  even mind  if it was 
cheap and fast .  g 
Suggest ions  p lease:  What language,  mach ine ,  type,  etc?  How should the d ic t ionary  
be s tored  (assume any random-accesss  device you are  fami l ia r  wit'h)? D iscuss ' the  
goa ls ,  rank ing them in t~,~ l ight of your  own exper ience .

There  i s  much to c r i t i c i ze  in the cho ice  and fo rm of the above quest ions .  
The na ivety  i s  obv ious  - to a cer ta in  extent  it i s  due to my own inexper ience  in 
th i s  f ie ld  (KVAL" s p rob lem has  sure ly  been  faced  - i f  not so lved  - by every  IR 
pro jec t ,  for  example) .  To a greater  extent ,  however ,  the na ivety  i s  p resent  to 
p revent  the quest ions  f rom conta in ing  the i r  own answers .  By a l l  means ,  c r i t i c i ze  
the  quest ions .  If you do not fee l  they  are  per t inent  to your  own exper ience ,  or  to 
the prob lem i t se l f ,  ask  your  own, and answer  them.  
P lease  in fo rm me i f  you would be in teres ted  in tak ing  par t  in a pane l  d i s -  
cuss ion  dur ing  the  conference .
