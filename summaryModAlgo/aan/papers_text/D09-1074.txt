Abstract
Current statistical machine translation
(SMT) systems are trained on sentence-
aligned and word-aligned parallel text col-
lected from various sources. Translation
model parameters are estimated from the
word alignments, and the quality of the
translations on a given test set depends
on the parameter estimates. There are
at least two factors affecting the parame-
ter estimation: domain match and training
data quality. This paper describes a novel
approach for automatically detecting and
down-weighing certain parts of the train-
ing corpus by assigning a weight to each
sentence in the training bitext so as to op-
timize a discriminative objective function
on a designated tuning set. This way, the
proposed method can limit the negative ef-
fects of low quality training data, and can
adapt the translation model to the domain
of interest. It is shown that such discrim-
inative corpus weights can provide sig-
nificant improvements in Arabic-English
translation on various conditions, using a
state-of-the-art SMT system.
1 Introduction
Statistical machine translation (SMT) systems rely
on a training corpus consisting of sentences in
the source language and their respective reference
translations to the target language. These paral-
lel sentences are used to perform automatic word
alignment, and extract translation rules with asso-
ciated probabilities. Typically, a parallel training
corpus is comprised of collections of varying qual-
ity and relevance to the translation problem of in-
terest. For example, an SMT system applied to
broadcast conversational data may be trained on
a corpus consisting mostly of United Nations and
newswire data, with only a very small amount of
in-domain broadcast news/conversational data. In
this case, it would be desirable to down-weigh the
out-of-domain data relative to the in-domain data
during the rule extraction and probability estima-
tion. Similarly, it would be good to assign a lower
weight to data of low quality (e.g., poorly aligned
or incorrectly translated sentences) relative to data
of high quality.
In this paper, we describe a novel discrimina-
tive training method that can be used to estimate a
weight for each sentence in the training bitext so as
to optimize an objective function ? expected trans-
lation edit rate (TER) (Snover et al, 2006) ? on a
held-out development set. The training bitext typ-
ically consists of millions of (parallel) sentences,
so in order to ensure robust estimation we express
each sentence weight as a function of sentence-
level features, and estimate the parameters of this
mapping function instead. Sentence-level fea-
tures may include the identifier of the collection or
genre that the sentence belongs to, the number of
tokens in the source or target side, alignment infor-
mation, etc. The mapping from features to weights
can be implemented via any differentiable func-
tion, but in our experiments we used a simple per-
ceptron. Sentence weights estimated in this fash-
ion are applied directly to the phrase and lexical
counts unlike any previously published method to
the author?s knowledge. The tuning framework is
developed for phrase-based SMT models, but the
tuned weights are also applicable to the training of
a hierarchical model. In cases where the tuning set
used for corpus weight estimation is a close match
to the test set, this method yields significant gains
in TER, BLEU (Papineni et al, 2002), and ME-
TEOR (Lavie and Agarwal, 2007) scores over a
state-of-the-art hierarchical baseline.
The paper is organized as follows. Related work
on data selection, data weighting, and model adap-
tation is presented in Section 2. The corpus weight
708
approach and estimation algorithm are described
in Section 3. Experimental evaluation of the ap-
proach is presented in Sections 4 and 5. Section 6
concludes the paper with a few directions for fu-
ture work.
2 Related Work
Previous work related to corpus weighting may
be split into three categories: data selection, data
weighting, and translation model adaptation. The
first two approaches may improve the quality
of the word alignment and prevent phrase-pairs
which are less useful for the domain to be learned.
The model adaptation, on the other hand, may
boost the weight of the more relevant phrase-
pairs or introduce translations for unseen source
phrases.
Resnik and Smith (2003) mined parallel text
from the web using various filters to identify likely
translations. The filtering may be viewed as a
data selection where poor quality translation are
discarded before word alignment. Yasuda et al
(2008) selected subsets of an existing parallel cor-
pus to match the domain of the test set. The dis-
carded sentence pairs may be valid translations
but they do not necessarily improve the translation
quality on the test domain. Mandal et al (2008)
used active learning to select suitable training data
for human translation. Hildebrand et al (2005) se-
lected comparable sentences from parallel corpora
using information retrieval techniques.
Lu et al (2007) proposed weighting compara-
ble portions of the parallel text before word align-
ment based on information retrieval. The relevant
portions of the parallel text were given a higher in-
teger weight in GIZA++ word alignment. Similar
effect may be achieved by replicating the relevant
subset in the training data.
Lu et al (2007) also proposed training adapted
translation models which were interpolated with a
model trained on the entire parallel text. Snover
et al (2008) used cross-lingual information re-
trieval to identify possible bias-rules to improve
the coverage on the source side. These rules may
cover source phrases for which no translations
were learned from the available parallel text.
Koehn and Schroeder (2007) described a pro-
cedure for domain adaptation that was using two
translation models in decoding, one trained on
in-domain data and the other on out-of-domain
data. Phrase translation scores from the two mod-
els where combined in a log-linear fashion, with
weights estimated based on minimum error rate
training (Och, 2003) on a designated tuning set.
The method described in this paper can also be
viewed as data filtering or (static) translation adap-
tation, but it has the following advantages over
previously published techniques:
1. The estimated corpus weights are discrim-
inative and are computed so as to directly
optimize an MT performance metric on a
pre-defined development set. Unlike the do-
main adaptation technique in (Koehn and
Schroeder, 2007), which also estimates the
adaptation parameters discriminatively, our
proposed method does not require a man-
ual specification of the in-domain and out-
of-domain training data collections. Instead,
it automatically determines which collections
are most relevant to the domain of interest,
and increases their weight while decreasing
the weight assigned to less relevant collec-
tions.
2. All sentences in the parallel corpus can in-
fluence the translation model, as opposed
to filtering/discarding data. However, the
proposed method can still assign very low
weights to parts of the corpus, if it determines
that it helps improve MT performance.
3. The framework used for estimating the cor-
pus weights can be easily extended to support
discriminative alignment link-level weights,
thus allowing the system to automatically
identify which portions of the training sen-
tences are most useful.
Naturally, as with any method, the proposed
technique has certain limitations. Specifically, it
is only concerned with influencing the translation
rule probabilities via the corpus weights; it does
not change the set of rules extracted. Thus, it is
unable to add new translation rules as in Snover
et al (2008). Also, it can potentially lead to pa-
rameter over-fitting, especially if the function that
maps sentence features to weights is complex and
based on a large number of parameters, or if the
development set used for estimating the mapping
function does not match the characteristics of the
test set.

3 Corpus Weights Estimation
3.1 Feature Extraction
The purpose of feature extraction is to identify,
for each sentence in the parallel training data, a
set of features that can be useful in estimating a
weight that is correlated with quality or relevance
to the MT task at hand. Starting from sentence-
aligned, word-aligned parallel training data, one
could extract various types of sentence-level fea-
tures. For example, we could specify features that
describe the two sides of the parallel data or the
alignment between them, such as collection id,
genre id, number of source tokens, number of tar-
get tokens, ratio of number of source and target
tokens, number of word alignment links, fraction
of source tokens that are unaligned, and fraction
of target tokens that are unaligned. Additionally,
we could include information retrieval (IR) related
features that reflect the relevance of a training sen-
tence to the domain of interest, e.g., by measur-
ing vector space model (VSM) distance of the sen-
tence to the current tuning set, or its log likelihhod
with respect to an in-domain language model.
Note that the collection and genre identifiers
(ids) mentioned above are bit vectors. Each col-
lection in the training set is mapped to a number.
A collection may consist of sentences from multi-
ple genres (e.g., newswire, web, broadcast news,
broadcast conversations). Genres are also mapped
to a unique number across the whole training set.
Then, given a sentence in the training bitext, we
can extract a binary vector that contains two non-
zero bits, one indicating the collection id, and an-
other denoting the genre id.
It is worth mentioning that in the experiments
reported later in this paper we made use of only the
collection and genre ids as features, although the
framework supports general sentence-level fea-
tures.
3.2 Mapping Features to Weights
As mentioned previously, one way to map a fea-
ture vector to a weight is to use a perceptron.
A multi-layer neural network may also be used,
but at the expense of slower training. In this
work, all of the experiments carried out made use
of a perceptron mapping function. However, it
is also possible to cluster the training sentences
into classes by training a Gaussian mixture model
(GMM) on their respective feature vectors1. Then,
given a feature vector we can compute the (poste-
rior) probability that it was generated by one of
the N Gaussians in the GMM, and use this N-
dimensional vector of posteriors as input to the
perceptron. This is similar to having a neural net-
work with a static hidden layer and Gaussian acti-
vation functions.
Given the many choices available in mapping
features to weights, we will describe the mapping
function in general terms. Let f
i
be the n ? 1
feature vector corresponding to sentence i. Let
?(x;?) denote a function Rn ? (0, 1) that is pa-
rameterized in terms of the parameter vector ? and
maps a feature vector x to a scalar weight in (0, 1).
The goal of the automatic corpus weight estima-
tion procedure is to estimate the parameter vector
? so as to optimize an objective function on a de-
velopment set.
3.3 Training with Weighted Corpora
Once the sentence features have been mapped to
weights, the translation rule extraction and prob-
ability estimation can proceed as usual, but with
weighted counts. For example, let w
i
= ?(f
i
;?)
be the weight assigned to sentence i. Let (s, t) be
a source-target phrase pair that can be extracted
from the corpus, and A(s) and B(t) indicating the
sets of sentences that s and t occur in. Then,
P (s|t) =
?
j?A(s)?B(t)
w
j
c
j
(s, t)
?
j?B(t)
w
j
c
j
(t)
(1)
where c
j
(?) denotes the number of occurrences of
the phrase (or phrase-pair) in sentence j.
3.4 Optimizing the Mapping Function
Estimation of the parameters ? of the mapping
function ? can be performed by directly optimiz-
ing a suitable objective function on a development
set. Ideally, we would like to estimate the param-
eters of the mapping function so as to directly op-
timize an automatic MT performance evaluation
metric, such as TER or BLEU on the full transla-
tion search space. However, this is extremely com-
putationally intensive for two reasons: (a) opti-
mizing in the full translation search space requires
a new decoding pass for each iteration of opti-
mization; and (b) a direct optimization of TER or
1Note that in order to train such a GMM it may be nec-
essary to first apply a decorrelating, dimensionality reducing,
transform (e.g., principal component analysis) to the features.
710
BLEU requires the use of a derivative free, slowly
converging optimization method such as MERT
(Och, 2003), because these objective functions are
not differentiable.
In our case, for every parameter vector update
we need to essentially retrain the translation model
(reestimate the phrase and lexical translation prob-
abilities based on the updated corpus weights), so
the cost of each iteration is significantly higher
than in a typical MERT application. For these rea-
sons, in this work we chose to minimize the ex-
pected TER over a translation N-best on a desig-
nated tuning set, which is a continuous and differ-
entiable function and can be optimized with stan-
dard gradient descent methods in a small number
of iterations. Note, that using expected TER is not
the only option here; any criterion that can be ex-
pressed as a continuous function of the phrase or
lexical translation probabilities can be used to op-
timize ?.
Given an N-best of translation hypotheses over
a development set of S sentences, we can define
the expected TER as follows
T =
?
S
s=1
?
N

where N
s
is the number of translation hypothe-
ses available for segment s; 
sj
is the minimum
raw edit distance between hypothesis j of seg-
ment s (or h
sj
, for short) and the reference transla-
tion(s) corresponding to segment s; r
s
is the aver-
age number of reference translation tokens in seg-
ment s, and p
sj
is the posterior probability of hy-
pothesis h
sj
in the N-best. The latter is computed
as follows
p
sj
=
e
?L
sj
?
N
s
k=1
e
?L
sk
(3)
where L
sj
is the total log likelihood of hypothe-
sis h
sj
, and ? is a tunable scaling factor that can
be used to change the dynamic range of the likeli-
hood scores and hence the distribution of posteri-
ors over the N-best. The hypothesis likelihood L
sj
is typically computed as a dot product of a decod-
ing weight vector and a vector of various ?feature?
scores, such as log phrase translation probability,
log lexical translation probability, log n-gram lan-
guage model probability, and number of tokens in
the hypothesis. However, in order to simplify this
presentation we will assume that it contains a sin-
gle translation model score, the log phrase transla-
tion probability of source given target. This score
is a sum of log conditional probabilities, similar
to the one defined in Equation 1. Therefore, L
sj
is indirectly a function of the training sentence
weights.
In order to minimize the expected TER T , we
need to compute the derivative of T with respect
to the mapping function parameters ?. Using the
chain rule, we get equations (4)-(8), where the
summation in Equation 6 is over all source-target
phrase pairs in the derivation of hypothesis h
sm
, ?
is the decoding weight assigned to the log phrase
translation score, and the summation in Equation
7 is over all training sentences2.
Thus, in order to compute the derivative of
the objective function we first need to calculate
? lnP (s
k
|t
k
)
??
for every phrase pair (s
k
, t
k
) in the
translation N-best based on Equations 7 and 8,
which requires time proportional to the number of
occurrences of these phrases in the parallel train-
ing data. After that, we can compute ?Lsm
??
for
each hypothesis h
sm
, based on Equation 6. Fi-
nally, we calculate ? ln psj
??
and ?T
??
based on Equa-
tions 5 and 4, respectively.
3.5 Implementation Issues
In our system, the corpus weights were trained
based on N-best translation hypotheses generated
by a phrase-based MT system on a designated tun-
ing set. Each translation hypothesis in the N-best
has a score that is a (linear) function of the fol-
lowing log translation probabilities: target phrase
given source phrase, source phrase given target
phrase, and lexical smoothing term. Additionally,
each hypothesis specifies information about its
derivation, i.e., which source-target phrase pairs it
consists of. Therefore, given an N-best, we can
identify the set of unique phrase pairs and use this
information in order to perform a filtered accumu-
lation of the statistics needed for calculating the
derivative in Equation 8. This reduces the storage
needed for the sufficient statistics significantly.
Minimization of the expected TER of the N-
best hypotheses was performed using the limited-
memory BFGS algorithm (Liu and Nocedal,
1989). Typically, the parameter vector ? required
about 30 iterations of LBFGS to converge.
Since the N-best provides only a limited repre-
sentation of the MT hypothesis search space, we
regenerated the N-best after every 30 iterations

sj
includes other translation
scores, e.g., lexical translation probabilities, the derivative

of LBFGS training, merging new hypotheses with
translations from previous iterations. The overall
training procedure is described in more detail be-
low:
1. Initialize parameter vector ? to small random
values, so that all training sentences receive
approximately equal weights.
2. Initialize phrase-based MT decoding weights
to previously tuned values.
3. Perform weighted phrase rule extraction as
described in Equation 1, to estimate the
phrase and lexical translation probabilities.
4. Decode the tuning set, generating N-best.
5. Merge N-best hypotheses from previous iter-
ations to current N-best.
6. Tune decoding weights so as to minimize
TER on merged N-best, using a derivative
free optimization method. In our case, we
used Powell?s algorithm (Powell, 1964) mod-
ified by Brent as described in (Brent, 1973) 3.
7. Identify set of unique source-target phrase
pairs in merged N-best.
8. Extract sufficient statistics from training data
for all phrases identified in step 7.
3This method was first used for N-best based parameter
optimization in (Ostendorf et al, 1991).
9. Run the LBFGS algorithm to minimize the
expected TER in the merged N-best, using
the derivative equations described previously.
10. Assign a weight to each training sentence
based on the ? values optimized in 9.
11. Go to step 3.
Typically, the corpus weights converge in about
4-5 main iterations. The calculation of the deriva-
tive is parallelized to speed up computation, re-
quiring about 10 minutes per iteration of LBFGS.
4 Experimental Setup
In this section we describe the setup that was used
for all experiments reported in this paper. Specif-
ically, we provide details about the training data,
development sets, and MT systems (phrase-based
and hierarchical).
4.1 Training Data
All MT training experiments made use of an
Arabic-English corpus of approximately 200 mil-
lion tokens (English side). Most of the collections
in this corpus are available through the Linguis-
tic Data Consortium (LDC) and are regularly part
of the resources specified for the constrained data
track of the NIST MT evaluation4.
4For a list of the NIST MT09 constrained train-
ing condition resources, see http://www.itl.
nist.gov/iad/mig/tests/mt/2009/MT09_
ConstrainedResources.pdf
712
The corpus includes data from multiple gen-
res, as shown in Table 1. The ?Sakhr? newswire
collection is a set of Arabic-to-English and
English-to-Arabic data provided by Sakhr Soft-
ware, totaling about 30.8 million tokens, and
is only available to research teams participat-
ing in the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency (DARPA) Global Autonomous Language
Exploitation (GALE) program. The ?LDC Giga-
word (ISI)? collection was produced by automati-
cally detecting and extracting portions of parallel
text from the monolingual LDC Arabic and En-
glish Gigaword collections, using a method devel-
oped at the Information Sciences Institute (ISI) of
the University of Southern California.

Table 1: Composition of the Arabic-English par-
allel corpus used for MT training.
It is easy to see that most of the parallel train-
ing data are either newswire or from United Na-
tions. The amount of web text or broadcast
news/conversations is only a very small fraction
of the total corpus. In total, there are 31 collec-
tions in the training bitext. Some collections (es-
pecially those released recently by LDC for the
GALE project) consist of data from multiple gen-
res. The total number of unique genres (or data
types) in the training set is 10.
Besides the above bitext, we also used approxi-
mately 8 billion words of English text for language
model (LM) training (3.7B words from the LDC
Gigaword corpus, 3.3B words of web-downloaded
text, and 1.1B words of data from CNN archives).
This data was used to train two language mod-
els: an entropy-pruned trigram LM, used in decod-
ing, and an unpruned 5-gram LM used in N-best
rescoring. Kneser-Ney smoothing was applied to
the n-grams in both cases.
4.2 Development Sets
The development sets used for tuning and testing
the corpus weights and other MT settings were
comprised of documents from previous Arabic-
English NIST MT evaluation sets and from GALE
development/evaluation sets.
Specifically, the newswire Tune and Test sets
consist of documents from the following col-
lections: the newswire portion of NIST MT04,
MT05, MT06, and MT08 evaluation sets, the
GALE Phase 1 (P1) and Phase 2 (P2) evaluation
sets, and the GALE P2 and P3 development sets.
The web Tune and Test sets are made of docu-
ments from NIST MT06 and MT08, the GALE P1
and P2 evaluation sets, the GALE P2 and P3 devel-
opment sets, and a held-out portion of the GALE
year 1 quarter 4 web training data release.
The audio Tune and Test sets consist of roughly
equal parts of news and conversations broadcast
from November 2005 through May 2007 by ma-
jor Arabic-speaking television and radio stations
(e.g., Al-Jazeera, Al-Arabiya, Syrian TV), totaling
approximately 14 hours of speech. The audio was
processed through automated speech recognition
(ASR) in order to produce (errorful) transcripts
that were used as input to all MT decoding experi-
ments reported in this paper. However, the corpus
weight estimation was carried out based on N-best
MT of the Arabic audio reference transcriptions
(i.e., the transcripts had no speech recognition er-
rors, and contained full punctuation).
It is important to note that some of the docu-
ments in the above devsets have multiple reference
translations (usually 4), while others have only
one. Most of the documents in the newswire sets
have 4 references, but unfortunately the web and
audio sets have, on average, less than 2 reference
translations per segment. More details are listed in
Table 2.
Another important note is that, although the au-
dio sets consist of both broadcast news (BN) and
broadcast conversations (BC), we did not perform
BN or BC-specific tuning. Corpus weights and
MT decoding parameters were optimized based on
a single Tune set, on a mix of BN and BC data.
However, when we report speech translation re-
sults in later sections, we break down the perfor-

4.3 MT Systems
Experiments were performed using two types of
statistical MT systems: a phrase-based system,
similar to Pharaoh (Koehn, 2004), and a state-
of-the-art, hierarchical string-to-dependency-tree
system, similar to (Shen et al, 2008).
The phrase-based MT system employs a pruned
3-gram LM in decoding, and can optionally gen-
erate N-best unique translation hypotheses which
are used to estimate the corpus weights, as de-
scribed in Section 3.
The hierarchical MT system performs decoding
with the same 3-gram LM, generates N-best of
unique translation hypotheses, and then rescores
them using a large, unpruned 5-gram LM in order
to select the best scoring translation. It is worth
mentioning that this hierarchical MT system pro-
vides a very strong baseline; it achieves a case-
sensitive BLEU score of 52.20 on the newswire
portion of the NIST MT08 evaluation set, which
is similar to the score of the second-best system
that participated in the unconstrained data track of
the NIST MT08 evaluation.
Both types of models were trained on the same
word alignments generated by GIZA++ (Och and
Ney, 2003).
5 Results
In this section we report results on the Arabic
newswire, web, and audio development sets, us-
ing both phrase-based and hierarchical MT sys-
tems, in terms of TER, BLEU5, and METEOR
(Lavie and Agarwal, 2007). Whenever corpus
weights are used, they were estimated on the des-
ignated Tune set using the phrase-based MT sys-

tem. Only the collection and genre ids were used
as sentence features in order to estimate the corpus
weights. As mentioned in Section 4.1, the train-
ing bitext consists of 31 collections and 10 gen-
res, so each training sentence was assigned a 41-
dimensional binary vector indicating its particu-
lar collection/genre combination. That vector was
then mapped into a single weight using a percep-

Results using the phrase-based MT system are
shown in Table 3. In all cases, the decoding
weights were optimized so as to minimize TER
on the designated Tune set. On newswire, the
discriminative corpus weights provide 0.8% abso-
lute gain in TER, in both Tune and Test sets. On
web, the TER gain is 0.9% absolute on Tune and
0.5% on Test. On the audio Test set, the TER gain
is 0.5% on BN and 1.4% on BC. Significant im-
provements were also obtained in the BLEU and
METEOR scores, on all sets and conditions.
5.2 Hierarchical MT
Results using the hierarchical MT system are
shown in Table 4. The hierarchical system
used different tuning criteria in each genre. On
newswire, the decoding weights were optimized
so as to maximize BLEU, while on web and audio
the tuning was based on 0.5TER+0.5(1?BLEU)
(referred to as TERBLEU in what follows). Note
that these were the criteria for tuning the decoding
weights; whenever corpus weights were used, they
were taken from the phrase-based system.
It is interesting to see that gains from discrimi-
native corpus weights carry over to the more pow-
erful hierarchical MT system. On newswire Test,
the gain in BLEU is 0.8; on web Test, the gain in
TERBLEU is 0.3. On the audio Test set, the cor-
pus weights provide 0.7 and 0.75 TERBLEU re-
duction on BN and BC, respectively. As with the

6 Conclusions
We have described a novel approach for estimat-
ing a weight for each sentence in a parallel train-
ing corpus so as to optimize MT performance of a
phrase-based statistical MT system. The sentence
weights influence MT performance by being ap-
plied to the phrase and lexical counts during trans-
lation rule extraction and probability estimation.
In order to ensure robust training of the weights,
we expressed them as a function of sentence-level
features. Then, we defined the process for opti-
mizing the parameters of that function based on
the expected TER of a translation hypothesis N-
best on a designated tuning set.
The proposed technique was evaluated in the
context of Arabic-English translation, on multiple
conditions. It was shown that encouraging results
were obtained by just using collection and genre
ids as features. Interestingly, the discriminative
corpus weights were found to be generally appli-
cable and provided gains in a state-of-the-art hi-
erarchical string-to-dependency-tree MT system,
even though they were trained using the phrase-
based MT system.
Next step is to include other sentence-level fea-
tures, as described in Section 3.1. Finally, the
technique described in this paper can be extended
to address the estimation of weights at the align-
ment link level, based on link-level features. We
believe that this will have a larger impact on the
lexical and phrase translation probabilities, since
there is a large number of parallel training sen-
tences that are partially correct, i.e., they contain
parts that are aligned and translated correctly, and
parts that are wrong. The current procedure tries
to assign a single weight to such sentences, so
there is no way to distinguish between the ?good?
and ?bad? portions of each sentence. Pushing the
weight estimation at the alignment link level will
alleviate this problem and will make the discrimi-
native training more targeted.
