Abstract
This paper describes SIE (Simple Infor-
mation Extraction), a modular information
extraction system designed with the goal
of being easily and quickly portable across
tasks and domains. SIE is composed by
a general purpose machine learning algo-
rithm (SVM) combined with several cus-
tomizable modules. A crucial role in the
architecture is played by Instance Filter-
ing, which allows to increase efficiency
without reducing effectiveness. The re-
sults obtained by SIE on several standard
data sets, representative of different tasks
and domains, are reported. The experi-
ments show that SIE achieves performance
close to the best systems in all tasks, with-
out using domain-specific knowledge.
1 Introduction
In designing Information Extraction (IE) systems
based on supervised machine learning techniques,
there is usually a tradeoff between carefully tun-
ing the system to specific tasks and domains and
having a ?generic? IE system able to obtain good
(even if not the topmost) performance when ap-
plied to different tasks and domains (requiring a
very reduced porting time). Usually, the former
alternative is chosen and system performance is
often shown only for a very limited number of
tasks (sometimes even only for a single task), af-
ter a careful tuning. For example, in the Bio-entity
Recognition Shared Task at JNLPBA 2004 (Kim
et al, 2004) the best performing system obtained
a considerable performance improvement adopt-
ing domain specific hacks.
A second important issue in designing IE sys-
tems concerns the fact that usually IE data sets are
highly unbalanced (i.e., the number of positive ex-
amples constitutes only a small fraction with re-
spect to the number of negative examples). This
fact has important consequences. In some ma-
chine learning algorithms the unbalanced distri-
bution of examples can yield a significant loss in
classification accuracy. Moreover, very large data
sets can be problematic to process due to the com-
plexity of many supervised learning techniques.
For example, using kernel methods, such as word
sequence and tree kernels, can become prohibitive
due to the difficulty of kernel based algorithms,
such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) (Cortes
and Vapnik, 1995), to scale to large data sets. As
a consequence, reducing the number of instances
without degrading the prediction accuracy is a cru-
cial issue for applying advanced machine learning
techniques in IE, especially in the case of highly
unbalanced data sets.
In this paper, we present SIE (Simple Informa-
tion Extraction), an information extraction system
based on a supervised machine learning approach
for extracting domain-specific entities from docu-
ments. In particular, IE is cast as a classification
problem by applying SVM to train a set of classi-
fiers, based on a simple and general-purpose fea-
ture representation, for detecting the boundaries of
the entities to be extracted.
SIE was designed with the goal of being easily
and quickly portable across tasks and domains. To
support this claim, we conducted a set of exper-
iments on several tasks in different domains and
languages. The results show that SIE is competi-
tive with the state-of-the-art systems, and it often
outperforms systems customized to a specific do-
main.
SIE resembles the ?Level One? of the ELIE
algorithm (Finn and Kushmerick, 2004). How-
9
ever, a key difference between the two algorithms
is the capability of SIE to drastically reduce the
computation time by exploiting Instance Filtering
(Gliozzo et al, 2005a). This characteristic allows
scaling from toy problems to real-world data sets
making SIE attractive in applicative fields, such as
bioinformatics, where very large amounts of data
have to be analyzed.
2 A Simple IE system
SIE has a modular system architecture. It is com-
posed by a general purpose machine learning algo-
rithm combined with several customizable com-
ponents. The system components are combined
in a pipeline, where each module constrains the
data structures provided by the previous ones.
This modular specification brings significant ad-
vantages. Firstly, a modular architecture is sim-
pler to implement. Secondly, it allows to easily
integrate different machine learning algorithms.
Finally, it allows, if necessary, a fine tuning to
a specific task by simply specializing few mod-
ules. Furthermore, it is worth noting that we tested
SIE across different domains using the same basic
configuration without exploiting any domain spe-
cific knowledge, such as gazetteers, and ad-hoc
pre/post-processing.

Figure 1: The SIE Architecture.
The architecture of the system is shown in Fig-
ure 1. The information extraction task is per-
formed in two phases. SIE learns off-line a set of
data models from a specified labeled corpus, then
the models are applied to tag new documents.
In both phases, the Instance Filtering module
(Section 3) removes certain tokens from the data
set in order to speed-up the whole process, while
Feature Extraction module (Section 4) is used to
extract a pre-defined set of features from the to-
kens. In the training phase, the Learning Mod-
ule (Section 5) learns two distinct models for each
entity, one for the beginning boundary and an-
other for the end boundary (Ciravegna, 2000; Fre-
itag and Kushmerick, 2000). In the recognition
phase, as a consequence, the Classification mod-
ule (Section 5) identifies the entity boundaries as
distinct token classifications. A Tag Matcher mod-
ule (Section 6) is used to match the boundary pre-
dictions made by the Classification module. Tasks
with multiple entities are considered as multiple
independent single-entity extraction tasks (i.e. SIE
only extracts one entity at a time).
3 Instance Filtering
The purpose of the Instance Filtering (IF) mod-
ule is to reduce the data set size and skewness
by discarding harmful and superfluous instances
without degrading the prediction accuracy. This
is a generic module that can be exploited by any
supervised system that casts IE as a classification
problem.
Instance Filtering (Gliozzo et al, 2005a) is
based on the assumption that uninformative words
are not likely to belong to entities to recognize,
being their information content very low. A naive
implementation of this assumption consists in fil-
tering out very frequent words in corpora because
they are less likely to be relevant than rare words.
However, in IE relevant entities can be composed
by more than one token and in some domains a few
of such tokens can be very frequent in the corpus.
For example, in the field of bioinformatics, protein
names often contain parentheses, whose frequency
in the corpus is very high.
To deal with this problem, we exploit a set of In-
stance Filters (called Stop Word Filters), included
in a Java tool called jInFil1. These filters per-
form a ?shallow? supervision to identify frequent
words that are often marked as positive examples.
The resulting filtering algorithm consists of two
stages. First, the set of uninformative tokens is
identified by training the term filtering algorithm
on the training corpus. Second, instances describ-
ing ?uninformative? tokens are removed from both
the training and the test sets. Note that instances
are not really removed from the data set, but just
1http://tcc.itc.it/research/textec/
tools-resources/jinfil/
10
marked as uninformative. In this way the learning
algorithm will not learn from these instances, but
they will still appear in the feature description of
the remaining instances.
A Stop Word Filter is fully specified by a list of
stop words. To identify such a list, different fea-
ture selection methods taken from the text catego-
rization literature can be exploited. In text catego-
rization, feature selection is used to remove non-
informative terms from representations of texts. In
this sense, IF is closely related to feature selection:
in the former non-informative words are removed
from the instance set, while in the latter they are
removed from the feature set. Below, we describe
the different metrics used to collect a stop word
list from the training corpora.
Information Content (IC) The most commonly
used feature selection metric in text categoriza-
tion is based on document frequency (i.e, the num-
ber of documents in which a term occurs). The
basic assumption is that very frequent terms are
non-informative for document indexing. The fre-
quency of a term in the corpus is a good indica-
tor of its generality, rather than of its information
content. From this point of view, IF consists of
removing all tokens with a very low information
content2.
Correlation Coefficient (CC) In text catego-
rization the ?2 statistic is used to measure the lack
of independence between a term and a category
(Yang and Pedersen, 1997). The correlation coef-
ficient CC2 = ?2 of a term with the negative class
can be used to find those terms that are less likely
to express relevant information in texts.
Odds Ratio (OR) Odds ratio measures the ra-
tio between the odds of a term occurring in the
positive class, and the odds of a term occurring in
the negative class. In text categorization the idea
is that the distribution of the features on the rel-
evant documents is different from the distribution
on non-relevant documents (Raskutti and Kowal-
czyk, 2004). Following this assumption, a term
is non-informative when its probability of being a
negative example is sensibly higher than its prob-
ability of being a positive example (Gliozzo et al,
2005b).
2The information content of a word w can be measured
by estimating its probability from a corpus by the equation
I(w) = ?p(w) log p(w).
An Instance Filter is evaluated by using two
metrics: the Filtering Rate (?), the total percent-
age of filtered tokens in the data set, and the Pos-
itive Filtering Rate (?+), the percentage of pos-
itive tokens (wrongly) removed. A filter is opti-
mized by maximizing ? and minimizing ?+; this
allows us to reduce as much as possible the data
set size preserving most of the positive instances.
We fixed the accepted level of tolerance () on ?+
and found the maximum ? by performing 5-fold
cross-validation on the training set.
4 Feature Extraction
The Feature Extraction module is used to extract
for each input token a pre-defined set of features.
As said above, we consider each token an instance
to be classified as a specific entity boundary or
not. To perform Feature Extraction an applica-
tion called jFex3 was implemented. jFex gener-
ates the features specified by a feature extraction
script, indexes them, and returns the example set,
as well as the mapping between the features and
their indices (lexicon). If specified, it only ex-
tracts features for the instances not marked as ?un-
informative? by instance filtering. jFex is strongly
inspired by FEX (Cumby and Yih, 2003), but it
introduces several improvements. First of all, it
provides an enriched feature extraction language.
Secondly, it makes possible to further extend this
language through a Java API, providing a flexi-
ble tool to define task specific features. Finally,
jFex can output the example set in formats di-
rectly usable by LIBSVM (Chang and Lin, 2001),
SVMlight (Joachims, 1998) and SNoW (Carlson
et al, 1999).
4.1 Corpus Format
The corpus must be prepared in IOBE notation, a
extension of the IOB notation. Both notations do
not allow nested and overlapping entities. Tokens
outside entities are tagged with O, while the first
token of an entity is tagged with B-entity-type, the
last token is tagged E-entity-type, and all the to-
kens inside the entity boundaries are tagged with
I-entity-type, where entity-type is the type of the
marked entity (e.g. protein, person).
Beside the tokens and their types, the nota-
tion allows to represent general purpose and task-
specific annotations defining new columns. Blank

lines can be used to specify sentence or document
boundaries. Table 1 shows an example of a pre-
pared corpus. The columns are: the entity-type,
the PoS tag, the actual token, the token index, and
the output of the instance filter (the ?uninforma-
tive? tokens are marked with 0) respectively.

notation.
4.2 Extraction Language
As input to the begin and end classifiers, we use
a bit-vector representation. Each instance is rep-
resented encoding all the following basic features
for the actual token and for all the tokens in a con-
text window of fixed size (in the reported experi-
ments, 3 words before and 3 words after the actual
token):
Token The actual token.
POS The Part of Speech (PoS) of the token.
Token Shapes This feature maps each token into
equivalence classes that encode attributes
such as capitalization, numerals, single char-
acter, and so on.
Bigrams of tokens and PoS tags.
The Feature Extraction language allows to
formally encode the above problem description
through a script. Table 2 provides the extraction
script used in all the tasks4. More details about the
Extraction Language are provided in (Cumby and
Yih, 2003; Giuliano et al, 2005).
4In JNLPBA shared task we added some orthographic fea-
tures borrowed from the bioinformatics literature.

-1 inc loc: coloc(w,w) [-3, 3]
-1 inc loc: t [-3, 3]
-1 inc loc: coloc(t,t) [-3, 3]
-1 inc loc: sh [-3, 3]

5 Learning and Classification Modules
As already said, we approach IE as a classifica-
tion problem, assigning an appropriate classifica-
tion label to each token in the data set except for
the tokens marked as irrelevant by the instance fil-
ter. As learning algorithm we use SVM-light5. In
particular, we identify the boundaries that indi-
cate the beginning and the end of each entity as
two distinct classification tasks, following the ap-
proach adopted in (Ciravegna, 2000; Freitag and
Kushmerick, 2000). All tokens that begin(end) an
entity are considered positive instances for the be-
gin(end) classifier, while all the remaining tokens
are negative instances. In this way, two distinct
models are learned, one for the beginning bound-
ary and another for the end boundary. All the pre-
dictions produced by the begin and end classifiers
are then paired by the Tag Matcher module.
When we have to deal with more than one en-
tity (i.e., with a multi-class problem) we train 2n
binary classifiers (where n is the number of entity-
types for the task). Again, all the predictions are
paired by the Tag Matcher module.
6 Tag Matcher
All the positive predictions produced by the begin
and end classifiers are paired by the Tag Matcher
module. If nested or overlapping entities occur,
even if they are of different types, the entity with
the highest score is selected. The score of each
entity is proportional to the entity length probabil-
ity (i.e., the probability that an entity has a certain
length) and the scores assigned by the classifiers to
the boundary predictions. Normalizing the scores
makes it possible to consider the score function as
a probability distribution. The entity length distri-
bution is estimated from the training set.
For example, in the corpus fragment of Table 3
the begin and end classifiers have identified four
possible entity boundaries for the speaker of a
seminar. In the table, the left column shows the

actual label, while the right column shows the pre-
dictions and their normalized scores. The match-
ing algorithm has to choose among three mutu-
ally exclusive candidates: ?Mr. John?, ?Mr. John
Smith? and ?John Smith?, with scores 0.23 ?
0.12 ? 0.33 = 0.009108, 0.23 ? 0.34 ? 0.28 =
0.021896 and 0.1 ? 0.34 ? 0.33 = 0.01122, re-
spectively. The length distribution for the entity
speaker is shown in Table 4. In this example, the
matcher, choosing the candidate that maximizes
the score function, namely the second one, extracts
the actual entity.
7 Evaluation
In order to demonstrate that SIE is domain and
language independent we tested it on several tasks
using exactly the same configuration. The tasks
and the experimental settings are described in Sec-
tion 7.1. The results (Section 7.2) show that the
adopted filtering technique decreases drastically
the computation time while preserving (and some-
times improving) the overall accuracy of the sys-
tem.
7.1 The Tasks
SIE was tested on the following IE benchmarks:
JNLPBA Shared Task This shared task (Kim
et al, 2004) is an open challenge task proposed
at the ?International Joint Workshop on Natural
Language Processing in Biomedicine and its Ap-
plications?6. The data set consists of 2, 404 MED-
LINE abstracts from the GENIA project (Kim et
6http://research.nii.ac.jp/?collier/
workshops/JNLPBA04st.htm.
al., 2003), annotated with five entity types: DNA,
RNA, protein, cell-line, and cell-type. The GE-
NIA corpus is split into two partitions: training
(492,551 tokens), and test (101,039 tokens). The
fraction of positive examples with respect to the
total number of tokens in the training set varies
from 0.2% to 6%.
CoNLL 2002 & 2003 Shared Tasks These
shared tasks (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002; Tjong
Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003)7 concern
language-independent named entity recognition.
Four types of named entities are considered:
persons (PER), locations (LOC), organizations
(ORG) and names of miscellaneous (MISC) en-
tities that do not belong to the previous three
groups. SIE was applied to the Dutch and English
data sets. The Dutch corpus is divided into three
partitions: training and validation (on the whole
258, 214 tokens), and test (73, 866 tokens). The
fraction of positive examples with respect to the
total number of tokens in the training set varies
from 1.1% to 2%. The English corpus is divided
into three partitions: training and validation (on
the whole 274, 585 tokens), and test (50, 425 to-
kens). The fraction of positive examples with re-
spect to the total number of tokens in the training
set varies from 1.6% to 3.3%.
TERN 2004 The TERN (Time Expression
Recognition and Normalization) 2004 Evaluation8
requires systems to detect and normalize temporal
expressions occurring in English text (SIE did not
address the normalization part of the task). The
TERN corpus is divided into two partitions: train-
ing (249,295 tokens) and test (72,667 tokens). The
fraction of positive examples with respect to the
total number of tokens in the training set is about
2.1%.
Seminar Announcements The Seminar An-
nouncements (SA) collection (Freitag, 1998) con-
sists of 485 electronic bulletin board postings. The
purpose of each document in the collection is to
announce or relate details of an upcoming talk or
seminar. The documents were annotated for four
entities: speaker, location, stime, and etime. The
corpus is composed by 156, 540 tokens. The frac-
tion of positive examples varies from about 1% to

about 2%. The entire document collection is ran-
domly partitioned five times into two sets of equal
size, training and test (Lavelli et al, 2004). For
each partition, learning is performed on the train-
ing set and performance is measured on the corre-
sponding test set. The resulting figures are aver-
aged over the five test partitions.
7.2 Results
The experimental results in terms of filtering rate,
recall, precision, F1, and computation time for
JNLPBA, CoNLL-2002, CoNLL-2003, TERN and
SA are given in Tables 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 respectively.
To show the differences among filtering strategies
for JNLPBA, CoNLL-2002, TERN 2004 we used
CC, OR and IC filters, while the results for SA
and CoNLL-2003 are reported only for OR filter
(which usually produces the best performance).
For all filters we report results obtained by set-
ting four different values for parameter , the max-
imum value allowed for the Filtering Rate of pos-
itive examples.  = 0 means that no filter is used.

The results indicate that both CC and OR do ex-
hibit good performance and are far better than IC
in all the tasks. For example, in the JNLPBA data
set, OR allows to remove more than 70% of the in-
stances, losing less than 1% of the positive exam-
ples. These results pinpoint the importance of us-
ing a supervised metric to collect stop words. The
results also highlight that both CC and OR are ro-
bust against overfitting, because the difference be-
tween the filtering rates in the training and test sets
is minimal. We also report a significant reduction
of the data skewness. Table 10 shows that all the IF
techniques reduce sensibly the skewness ratio, the
ratio between the number of negative and positive
examples, on the JNLPBA data set9. As expected,
both CC and OR consistently outperform IC.
The computation time10 reported includes the
time to perform the overall process of training and
testing the boundary classifiers for each entity11.
The results indicate that both CC and OR are far
superior to IC, allowing a drastic reduction of the
time. Supervised IF techniques are then particu-
9We only report results for this data set as it exhibits the
highest skewness ratios.

1.66 GHz Power Mac G5.

cause it is negligible.

larly convenient when dealing with large data sets.
For example, using the CC metric the time re-
quired by SIE to perform the JNLPBA task is re-
duced from 615 to 109 minutes (see Table 5).
Both OR and CC allow to drastically reduce
the computation time and maintain the prediction
accuracy12 with small values of . Using OR,
for example, with  = 2.5% on JNLPBA, F1 in-
creases from 66.7% to 67.9%. On the contrary,
for CoNLL-2002 and TERN, for  > 2.5% and
 > 1% respectively, the performance of all the
filters rapidly declines. The explanation for this
behavior is that, for the last two tasks, the differ-
ence between the filtering rates on the training and
test sets becomes much larger for  > 2.5% and
 > 1%, respectively. That is, the data skewness
changes significantly from the training to the test
set. It is not surprising that an extremely aggres-
sive filtering step reduces too much the informa-
tion available to the classifiers, leading the overall

performance to decrease.
SIE achieves results close to the best systems in
all tasks13. It is worth noting that state-of-the-art
IE systems often exploit external, domain-specific
information (e.g. gazetteers (Carreras et al, 2002)
and lexical resources (Zhou and Su, 2004)) while

source.
8 Conclusion and Future Work
The portability, the language independence and
the efficiency of SIE suggest its applicability in
practical problems (e.g. semantic web, infor-
mation extraction from biological data) in which
huge collections of texts have to be processed ef-
ficiently. In this perspective we are pursuing the
recognition of bio-entities from several thousands
of MEDLINE abstracts. In addition, the effective-
ness of instance filtering will allow us to experi-
ment with complex kernel methods. For the fu-
ture, we plan to implement more aggressive in-
stance filtering schemata for Entity Recognition,
by performing a deeper semantic analysis of the
texts.
