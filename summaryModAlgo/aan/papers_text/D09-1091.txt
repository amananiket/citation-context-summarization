Abstract
We present a novel approach for multilin-
gual document clustering using only com-
parable corpora to achieve cross-lingual
semantic interoperability. The method
models document collections as weighted
graph, and supervisory information is
given as sets of must-linked constraints for
documents in different languages. Recur-
sive k-nearest neighbor similarity propa-
gation is used to exploit the prior knowl-
edge and merge two language spaces.
Spectral method is applied to find the best
cuts of the graph. Experimental results
show that using limited supervisory in-
formation, our method achieves promis-
ing clustering results. Furthermore, since
the method does not need any language
dependent information in the process, our
algorithm can be applied to languages in
various alphabetical systems.
1 Introduction
Document clustering is unsupervised classifica-
tion of text collections into distinct groups of sim-
ilar documents. It has been used in many in-
formation retrieval tasks, including data organiza-
tion (Siersdorfer and Sizov, 2004), language mod-
eling (Liu and Croft, 2004), and improving per-
formances of text categorization system (Aggar-
wal et al, 1999). Advance in internet technology
has made the task of managing multilingual docu-
ments an intriguing research area. The growth of
internet leads to the necessity of organizing docu-
ments in various languages. There exist thousands
of languages, not to mention countless minor ones.
Creating document clustering model for each lan-
guage is simply unfeasible. We need methods to
deal with text collections in diverse languages si-
multaneously.
Multilingual document clustering (MLDC) in-
volves partitioning documents, written in more
than one languages, into sets of clusters. Simi-
lar documents, even if they are written in differ-
ent languages, should be grouped together into
one cluster. The major challenge of MLDC is
achieving cross-lingual semantic interoperability.
Most monolingual techniques will not work since
documents in different languages are mapped into
different spaces. Spectral method such as Latent
Semantic Analysis has been commonly applied
for MLDC task. However, current techniques
strongly rely on the presence of common words
between different languages. This method would
only work if the languages are highly related, i.e.,
languages that share the same root. Therefore, we
need another method to improve the robustness of
MLDC model.
In this paper, we focus on the problem of bridg-
ing multilingual space for document clustering.
We are given text documents in different lan-
guages and asked to group them into clusters such
that documents that belong to the same topic are
grouped together. Traditional monolingual ap-
proach is impracticable since it is unable to pre-
dict how similar two multilingual documents are.
They have two different spaces which make con-
ventional cosine similarity irrelevant. We try to
solve this problem utilizing prior knowledge in
the form of must-linked constraints, gathered from
comparable corpora. Propagation method is used
to guide the language-space merging process. Ex-
perimental results show that the approach gives
encouraging clustering results.
This paper is organized as follows. In section 2,
we review related work. In section 3, we propose
our algorithm for multilingual document cluster-
ing. The experimental results are shown in section
4. Section 5 concludes with a summary.

2 Related Work
Chen and Lin (2000) proposed methods to clus-
ter multilingual documents using translation tech-
nology, relying on cross-lingual dictionary and
machine-translation system. Multilingual ontol-
ogy, such as Eurovoc, is also popular for MLDC
(Pouliquen et al, 2004). However, such resources
are scarce and expensive to build. Several other
drawbacks of using this technique include dictio-
nary limitation and word ambiguity.
More recently, parallel texts have been used to
connect document collections from different lan-
guages (Wei et al, 2008). This is done by collaps-
ing columns in a term by document matrix that are
translations of each other. Nevertheless, building
parallel texts is also expensive and requires a lot of
works, hence shifting the paradigm of multilingual
works to comparable corpora.
Comparable corpora are collections of texts in
different languages regarding similar topics pro-
duced at the same time. The key difference be-
tween comparable corpora and parallel texts is that
documents in comparable corpora are not neces-
sarily translations of each other. They are easier
to be acquired, and do not need exhaustive works
to be prepared. News agencies often give informa-
tion in many different languages and can be good
sources for comparable corpora. Terms in com-
parable corpora, being about the same topic, up
to some point explain the same concepts in differ-
ent languages. Pairing comparable corpora with
spectral method such as Latent Semantic Analysis
has become prevalent, e.g. (Gliozzo and Strappar-
ava, 2005). They rely on the presence of common
words and proper nouns among various languages
to build a language-independent space. The per-
formance of such method is highly dependent on
the languages being used. Here, we present an-
other approach to exploit knowledge in compa-
rable corpora; using propagation method to aid
spreading similarity between collections of docu-
ments in different languages.
Spectral clustering is the task of finding good
clusters by using information contained in the
eigenvectors of a matrix derived from the data.
It has been successfully applied in many applica-
tions including information retrieval (Deerwester
et al, 2003) and computer vision (Meila and Shi,
2000). An in-depth analysis of spectral algo-
rithm for clustering problems is given in (Ng et
al., 2002). Zhang and Mao (2008) used a related
technique called Modularity Eigenmap to extract
community structure features from the document
network to solve hypertext classification problem.
Semi-supervised clustering enhances clustering
task by incorporating prior knowledge to aid clus-
tering process. It allows user to guide the cluster-
ing process by giving some feedback to the model.
In traditional clustering algorithm, only unlabeled
data is used to find assignments of data points
to clusters. In semi-supervised clustering, prior
knowledge is given to improve performance of the
system. The supervision is usually given as pair
of must-linked constraints and cannot link con-
straints, first introduced in (Wagstaff and Cardie,
2000). Kamvar et al (2003) proposed spectral
learning algorithm that can take supervisory infor-
mation in the form of pairwise constraints or la-
beled data. Their algorithm is intended to be used
in monolingual context, while our algorithm is de-
signed to work in multilingual context.
3 Multilingual Spectral Clustering
There have been several works on multilingual
document clustering as mention previously in Sec-
tion 2. Our key contribution here is the propaga-
tion method to make spectral clustering algorithm
works for multilingual problems. The clustering
model exploits the supervisory information by de-
tecting k nearest neighbors of the newly-linked
documents, and propagates document similarity to
these neighbors. The model can be applied to any
multilingual text collections regardless of the lan-
guages. Overall algorithm is given in Section 3.1
and the method to merge multilingual spaces by
similarity propagation is given in Section 3.2.
3.1 Spectral Clustering Algorithm
Spectral clustering tries to find good clusters by
using top eigenvectors of normalized data affin-
ity matrix. The document set is being modeled as
undirected graph G(V,E,W ), where V , E, and
W denote the graph vertex set, edge set, and tran-
sition probability matrix, respectively. In graph
G, v ? V represents a document, and weight
w
ij
?W represents transition probability between
document v
i
to v
j
. The transition probabilities
can be interpreted as edge flows in Markov ran-
dom walk over graph vertices (documents in col-
lections).
Algorithm to perform spectral clustering is
given in Algorithm 1. Let A be affinity matrix
872
where element A
ij
is cosine similarity between
document v
i
and v
j
(Algorithm 1, line 1). It is
straightforward that documents belonging to dif-
ferent languages will have similarity zero. Rare
exception occurs when they have common words
because the languages are related one another.
As a consequence, the similarity matrix will have
many zeros. Our model amplifies prior knowledge
in the form of comparable corpora by perform-
ing document similarity propagation, presented in
Section 3.2 (Algorithm 1, line 4; Algorithm 2, ex-
plained in Section 3.2). After propagation, the
affinity matrix is post-processed (Algorithm 1, line
6, explained in Section 3.2) before being trans-
formed into transition probability matrix.
The transformation can be done using any nor-
malization for spectral methods. Define N =
D
?1
A, as in (Meila and Shi, 2001), where D is the
diagonal matrix whose elements D
ij
=
?
j
A
ij
(Algorithm 1, line 7). Alternatively, we can define
N = D
?1/2
AD
?1/2
(Ng et al, 2002), or N =
(A + d
max
I ? D)/d
max
(Fiedler, 1975), where
d
max
is the maximum rowsum of A. For our ex-
periment, we use the first normalization method,
though other methods can be applied as well.
Meila and Shi (2001) show that probability tran-
sition matrix N with t strong clusters will have t
piecewise constant eigenvectors. They also sug-
gest using these t eigenvectors in clustering pro-
cess. We use the information contains in t largest
eigenvectors of N (Algorithm 1, line 8-11) and
perform K-means clustering algorithm to find the
data clusters (Algorithm 1, line 12).
3.2 Propagating Prior Knowledge
We use information obtained from comparable
corpora to merge multilingual language spaces.
Suppose we have text collections in L different
languages. We combine this collections with com-
parable corpora, also in L languages, that act as
our supervisory information. Comparable corpora
are used to gather prior knowledge by making
must-linked constraints for documents in different
languages that belong to the same topic in the cor-
pora, propagating similarity to other documents
while doing so.
Initially, our affinity matrix A represents cosine
similarity between all pairs of documents. A
ij
is
set to zero if j is not the top k nearest neighbors
of i and likewise. Next, set A
ij
and A
ji
to 1 if
document i and document j are different in lan-

guage and belong to the same topic in our com-
parable corpora. This will incorporate the must-
linked constraint to our model. We can also give
supervisory information for pairs of document in
the same language, but this is optional. We also do
not use cannot-linked constraints since the main
goal is to merge multilingual spaces. In our exper-
iment we show that using only must-linked con-
straints with propagation is enough to achieve en-
couraging clustering results.
The supervisory information acquired from
comparable corpora only connects two nodes in
our graph. Therefore, the number of edges be-
tween documents in different languages is about
as many as the number of must-linked constraints
given. We argue that we need more edges between
pairs of documents in different languages to get
better results.
We try to build more edges by propagating sim-
ilarity to other documents that are most similar to
the newly-linked documents. Figure 1 gives an il-
lustration of edge-creation process when two mul-
tilingual documents (nodes) are connected. Sup-

pose that we have six documents in two differ-
ent languages. Initially, documents are only con-
nected with other documents that belong to the
same language. The supervisory information tells
us that two multilingual documents v
i
and v
j
should be connected (Figure 1(a)). We then build
an edge between these two documents. Further-
more, we also use this information to build edges
between v
i
and neighbors of v
j
and likewise (Fig-
ure 1(b)).
This follows from the hypothesis that bringing
together two documents should also bring other
documents that are similar to those two closer in
our clustering space. Klein et al (2002) stated
that a good clustering algorithm, besides satisfy-
ing known constraints, should also be able to sat-
isfy the implications of those constraints. Here,
we allow not only instance-level inductive impli-
cations, but utilize it to get higher-level inductive
implications. In other words, we alter similarity
space so that it can detect other clusters by chang-
ing the topology of the original space.
The process is analogous to shortening the dis-
tance between sets of documents in Euclidean
space. In vector space model, two documents that
are close to each other have high similarity, and
thus will belong to the same cluster. Pairing two
documents can be seen as setting the distance in
this space to 0, thus raising their similarity to 1.
While doing so, each document would also draw
sets of documents connected to it closer to the cen-
tre of the merge, which is equivalent to increasing
their similarities.
Suppose we have document v
i
and v
j
, and y and
z are sets of their respective k nearest neighbors,
where |y| = |z| = k. The propagation method
is a recursive algorithm with base S, the num-
ber of desired level of propagation. Recursive k-
nearest neighbor makes decision to give high sim-
ilarity between multilingual documents not only
determined by their similarity to the newly-linked
documents, but also their similarity to the k near-
est neighbors of the respective document. Several
documents are affected by a single supervisory in-
formation. This will prove useful when only lim-
ited amount of supervisory information given. It
uses document similarity matrix A, as defined in
the previous section.

.
3. Propagate higher order similarity to k nearest
neighbors of y and z, discounting the similar-
ity quadratically, until required level of prop-
agation S is reached (Algorithm 2, line 7 and
12).
The coefficient ? represents the degree of en-
forcement that the documents similar to a docu-
ment in one language, will also have high simi-
larity with other document in other language that
is paired up with its ancestor. On the other hand,
k represents the number of documents that are af-
fected by pairing up two multilingual documents.
After propagation, similarity of documents that
falls below some threshold ? is set to zero (Al-
gorithm 1, line 6). This post-processing step is
performed to nullify insignificant similarity values
propagated to a document. Additionally, if there
exists similarity of documents that is higher than
one, it is set to one.

4 Performance Evaluation
The goals of empirical evaluation include (1) test-
ing whether the propagation method can merge
multilingual space and produce acceptable clus-
tering results; (2) comparing the performance to
spectral clustering method without propagation.
4.1 Data Description
We tested our model using Reuters Corpus Vol-
ume 2 (RCV2), a multilingual corpus contain-
ing news in thirteen different languages. For our
experiment, three different languages: English,
French, and Spanish; in six different topics: sci-
ence, sports, disasters accidents, religion, health,
and economy are used. We discarded documents
with multiple category labels.
We do not apply any language specific pre-
processing method to the raw text data. Mono-
lingual TFIDF is used for feature weighting. All
document vectors are then converted into unit vec-
tor by dividing by its length. Table 1 shows the
average length of documents in our corpus.
4.2 Evaluation Metric
For our experiment, we used Rand Index (RI)
which is a common evaluation technique for clus-
tering task where the true class of unlabeled data

is known. Rand Index measures the percentage of
decisions that are correct, or simply the accuracy
of the model. Rand Index is defined as:
RI =
TP + TN
TP + FP + TN + FN
Rand Index penalizes false positive and false neg-
ative decisions during clustering. It takes into ac-
count decision that assign two similar documents
to one cluster (TP), two dissimilar documents to
different clusters (TN), two similar documents to
different clusters (FN), and two dissimilar docu-
ments to one cluster (FP). We do not include links
created by supervisory information when calculat-
ing true positive decisions and only consider the
number of free decisions made.
We also used F

monic mean of precision (P) and recall (R). F

4.3 Experimental Results
To prove the effectiveness of our clustering algo-
rithm, we performed the following experiments on
our data set. We first tested our algorithm on four
topics, science, sports, religion, and economy. We
then tested our algorithm using all six topics to
get an understanding of the performance of our
model in larger collections with more topics. We
used subset of our data as supervisory informa-
tion and built must-linked constraints from it. The
proportion of supervisory information provided to
the system is given in x-axis (Figure 2 - Figure
4.3). 0.2 here means 20% of documents in each
language are taken to be used as prior knowledge.
Since the number of documents in each language
for our experiment is the same, we have the same
numbers of documents in subset of English col-
lection, subset of French collection, and subset of
Spanish collection. We also ensure there are same
numbers of documents for a particular topic in all
three languages. We can build must-linked con-
straints as follows. For each document in the sub-
set of English collection, we create must-linked
constraints with one randomly selected document
from the subset of French collection and one ran-
domly selected document from the subset of Span-
ish collection that belong to the same topic with it.
We then create must-linked constraint between the
respective French and Spanish documents. The
constraints given to the algorithm are chosen so
that there are several links that connect every topic
in every language. Note that the class label in-

formation is only used to build must-linked con-
straints between documents, and we do not assign
the documents to a particular cluster.
Figure 2 shows the Rand Index as proportion
of supervisory information increases. Figure 3
and Figure 4.3 give purity and F
2
-measure for
the algorithm respectively. To show the impor-
tance of the propagation in multilingual space, we
give comparison with spectral clustering model
without propagation. Three lines in Figure 2 to
Figure 4.3 indicate: (1) results with propagation
(solid line); (2) results without propagation (long-
dashed line); and (3) results using Latent Se-
mantic Analysis(LSA)-based method by exploit-
ing common words between languages (short-
dashed line). For each figure, 6 plots are taken
starting from 0 in 0.2-point-increments. We con-
ducted the experiments three times for each pro-
portion of supervisory information and use the av-
erage values. As we can see from Figure 2, Fig-
ure 3, and Figure 4.3, the propagation method can
significantly improve the performance of spectral
clustering algorithm. For 1800 documents in 6
topics, we manage to achieve RI = 0.91, purity
= 0.84, and F
2
-measure = 0.76 with only 20% of
documents (360 documents) used as supervisory
information. Spectral clustering algorithm with-
out propagation can only achieve 0.69, 0.30, 0.28
for RI, purity, and F
2
-measure respectively. The
propagation method is highly effective when only
small amount of supervisory information given to
the algorithm. Obviously, the more supervisory in-
formation given, the better the performance is. As
the number of supervisory information increases,
the difference of the model performance with and
without propagation becomes smaller. This is
because there are already enough links between
multilingual documents, so we do not necessar-
ily build more links through similarity propagation
anymore. However, even when there are already
many links, our model with propagation still out-
performs the model without propagation.
We compare the performance of our algorithm
to LSA-based multilingual document clustering
model. We performed LSA to the multilingual
term by document matrix. We do not use paral-
lel texts and only rely on common words across
languages as well as must-linked constraints to
build multilingual space. The results show that ex-
ploiting common words between languages alone
is not enough to build a good multilingual se-
mantic space, justifying the usage of supervisory
information in multilingual document clustering
task. When supervisory information is introduced,
our method achieves better results than LSA-based
method. In general, the LSA-based method per-
forms better than the model without propagation.
We assess the sensitivity of our algorithm to
parameter ?, the penalty for similarity propaga-
tion. We assess the sensitivity of our algorithm
to parameter ?, the penalty for similarity prop-
agation. We tested our algorithm using various
?, starting from 0 to 1 in 0.2-point-increments,
while other parameters being held constant. Fig-
ure 5(a) shows that changing ? to some extent af-
fects the performance of the algorithm. However,
after some value of reasonable ? is found, increas-
ing ? does not have significant impact on the per-

formance of the algorithm. We also tested our al-
gorithm using various k, starting from 0 to 100
in 20-point-increments. Figure 5(b) reveals that
the performances of the model with different k are
comparable, as long as k is not too small. How-
ever, using too large k will slightly decrease the
performance of the model. Too many propaga-
tions make several dissimilar documents receive
high similarity value that cannot be nullified by
the post-processing step. Last, we experimented
using various t ranging from 2 to 20. Figure 5(c)
shows that the method performs best when t = 10,
and for reasonable value of t the method achieves
comparable performance.
5 Conclusion
We present here a multilingual spectral cluster-
ing model that is able to work irrespective of the
languages being used. The key component of
our model is the propagation algorithm to merge
multilingual spaces. We tested our algorithm
on Reuters RCV2 Corpus and compared the per-
formance with spectral clustering model without
propagation. Experimental results reveal that us-
ing limited supervisory information, the algorithm
achieves encouraging clustering results.
