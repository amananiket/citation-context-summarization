1.  Personal  Computer Systems (POS) represent  nowadays a 
s ign i f teaut  t rend  in  the professiona~, and amateur use of  
computers,  in  par t i cu la r  of min i -  and microcomputers? We be-  
l i eve  that  such systems must have the means fo r :  
(a)  knowledge representat ion  about the problem donm/n, the  
system i t se l f  and the par t ieu la r  users ;  
(b) man-n~chine in teract ion ,  tak ing  benef i t s  of  both par tners"  
ab i l i t i es ;  
(c)  access  to app l i ca t ion -oz - lented  programs and data  as we l l  
as to  o ther  computer systems? 
Our exper ience  wi th  natura l  language quest ion-anewer?n8 
systems has proved that  the share of.  QAS users  p re fer r~n6 rea l  
RL i s  ra ther  smal l .  Among the reasons  one can po in t  out such 
features  as inadequate  heav iness  and s lowness of  NL-proeessors ,  
the i r  unpor tab l l t ty .  These reasons ,  on one hand, and the appar -  
ent success  of  s imple tab le -dr iven  and product ion  ru le  systems,  
on the e ther ,  have led  us to  the development of  Adapt ive D ia l -  
ogue System as a bas i s  fo r  PCS, 
Our approach i s  based on the  in tegrat ion  of  3 core  
components a l low ing  an e f f i c ient  system implementat ion  w i th in  
the l im i ted  micz~computer resources :  
the Object  Base (OB) const i tu tes  a media fo r  s to r ing  and 
man ipu la t ion  of  systems ? , problem-oz~lented and lex ica l  
obJects; 
- the Adapt ive Dia logue Monitor  (AI~) p rov ides  the guidance 
- 55  - 
fo r  man-computer comnm?oat ion through die~ogue processes!  
- the P-4kach?ne ( I~)  accompl ishes the necessary  operat ions  
suppor t ing  system s own beha~ou~ as well as the access to  
app l ied  programs and data .  
p rocess  in  the system takes p lace w i th in  a cer t~ 
qn~ronment  which i s  character i zed  by a set  of mutu~ly  
access ib le  ob jec ts  and by in i t ia l  d ia logue  process .  A d ia logue 
process or  D-urocess comprises a number of in terconnected  
s ta tes  and supports  par t i cu la r  man-computer ac t iv i ty  on 
ach iev ing  some goa l .  Almost every s ta t~ of D-process acoompl- 
ieh~ a e~mple act  of com-mn?cat~ with the user ,  an~yzJ ,ug 
h ie  rep ly ,  per forming assoc ia ted  ac t ions  and t rans i t ing  to 
another  s ta te .  Thus an ana lo~r  could be drawn between D- 
-p rocess  and ATN, with the impor tant  d i f fe rence  that  D-process 
supports  oneoin8 d?e~ogue with  the user  ra ther  than an~ye is  
of p reentered  st~-Lnee 
There are ) s ta te  types :  
MENU - promptin8 the user  to  choose among e~ernat ivee!  
A3EVAL - accept ing  the asked Ye~ue from the user !  
ZVAL - get t ing  computed va lue  from externa l 'p rogram,  
By means of MENU and ~KVAL D-process iS communicating 
wi th  the user?s  te rmina l ,  IVAL connects  i t  wi th  app l ied  pro-  
8raew. The eot ions  with?n the s ta tes  are  expressed as. s t r ings  
of ~ per fo r~t J~ pred icat ion  of va lues ,  man ipu la t ion  of 
d i f fe rent  ob jec ts ,  ca l l~ Jae/ return?ng to another  D-processes ,  
runnL~ extern~ programs etc .  
Adapti~rity i s  of pr t~aa~ concern in  the presented  
approach s ince  i t  ~vee  the user ,  on one hand, the ab i l i ty  
to sub jec t  the system to h i s  par t i cu la r  needs! on the o ther  
- to put h imse l f  in to  an  ac t ive  or pass ive  pos i t ion  dur ing  
some coa~micat ion  process .  Adapt iv i ty  i s  provided by s t r i c t -  
l y  fo l low in  8 one pr inc ip le i  any k ind of sys tem's  ac t i~Lty  
per t inent  to man-computer oonzm~Lcation must be cont ro l led  by 
de f in i te  ob jec ts  whLch can be c reated  and modi f ied  by the 
neme or o ther  ac t iv i t ies .

2.  There are 3 bas ic  k lnds of  ob jec ts  in  the  OBs system 
suppor t~ (S -ob jec ts ) ,  p rob lem-or iented  (PO-obJeote)  and 
le~tca l  (L -ob jec ts ) .  Each of  these  k inds i s  fu r ther  d iv ided  
in to  categor ies  o r  types .  
S-ob.teots hold the cont ro l  over  man, computer in teract ion  
and the ~ocess to  app l ied  progrems and dBta. They descr ibe  
az~rth~ng res id ing  or happezLing in  the system and there fore  ~re 
ca l led  "descr ip tors" .  The fo l low ing  descr ip tors  are  of  the  
most t ,nportance:  
DE - enwlronment descr ip tors  
DP - d ia logue  process  descr ip tors  . 
DS - d ia logue  s ta te  desoz~ptors  
DX - program descr ip tors  
DD - data  descr ip tors  
DG - d ia logue  scenar io '  ~ ("game") descr ip tors  
DU - user  descr ip tors  
PO-ob.tects descr ibe  concepts ,  p roper t ies ,  re la t ions  and 
va lues  a l low ing  to  bu i ld  p rob lem-or iented  models .  PO-obJects 
are  d i f te rent ia ted  by the i r  ca tegor ies  ( typ~s) :  
C - c lasses  of  phys ica l  ob jec ts :  "count ry" ,  "person"  
R -  se~t i@ re la t ions :  "negot ia t ion" ,  ' ,disarmament" 
V - s t ruc tured  va lue  descr ip tors :  "date" ,  "NATO" 
T -  te rmina l  va lue  descr ip tors :  "ATOM", "STRING", "INTEGER" 
P - ob jec t  p roper t ies  substant ia ted  by V and T - values~ 
"pop- la t ion  " ,  "b~thday" ,  "address" ,  "weight"  
CP - ob jec t  p roper t ies  substant ia ted  by the o ther  C-ob Jeotss  
"cap i ta l "  (o f  count ry ) ,  " re la t ives"  (of  person)  
RP - semant ic  re la t ions  a r~entss  "par t i c ipants"  (o f  negot ia t -  
i on) ,  "p lace" ,  "goa l "  (of  any aot iw l ty )  
CI ,  B.I, V l ,  TI - ind iv idua l  ob jec ts  and ac tua l  va lues  - subst -  
ant ia t ions  of  C, R, V and T -ob jec tso  
For externa l  representat ion  of  ob jec ts  we use a formal ism of  
F - l ~ e  developed fo r  DILOS system /1 / .  S~nple exemples:  
oapltal (CP): IS olty; OF country 
- 57 -  
po l i t i c ian  (C): IS person;  from count ry ;  post o f f i c ia l -pos t  
o f f i c ia l -poet  (V): IS l i s t ;  0F ATOM; EL (pres ident  de fense-  
min is ter . . . )  
NATO (V): IS l i s t ;  OF country!  EL (Belgium Gr -Br i ta in . . . )  
Weinberger (CI ) :  IS po l i t i c ian |  from USA! post de fense-min is t -  
er  
de fense-min is ter  (T I ) :  IS ATOMj ELOP o f f i c ia l -pos t  
The problem domain model could be ~xpressed in  a fo re  of 
conceptual  semant ic  network /2 /  w i th  the nodes represented  by 
C, R, V and T -ob jec ts  and the arcs  labe led  by P, CP and RP- 
-ob jec ts?  Representat ion  of ac tua l  world f ragments  would then  
have a form of te rmina l  semantic network wi th  CI,  RI ,  VI and 
T I -ob jec ts  being the nodes,  connected by P, CP and RP-arcs .  
L -obteots  or "lexems" prov ide access to a l l  o ther  ob jec ts  
in  the 0B us ing  the words and phrases of p rob lem-or iented  
natura l  language (I~OL). Each lexeme has externa l  represent -  
a t ion  ( .  the name of L -ob jec t )  der ived  from the input  word 
form by simple morphologica l  t rans format ion?  Each L -ob jec t  has 
spec ia l  p roper t ies  which serve  fo r  two purposes" (1) po in t ing  
to o ther  ob jec ts  - denotat ions  of the g iven  lexeme and (2 )  
car ry ing  ~ammat ica l  marks fo r  e f f i c ient  POL ana lys i s .  
P resent ly  L -ob jec ts  are d iv ided  in to  the fo l low ing  10 
categor ies :  
LN - lexlcal names of PO and S-objects 
LS - synonyms polnting to other L-objects 
LC - components of word combinations and idioms 
LQ - question tokens - pronouns and adverbs ("who", "how") 
L J -  con~unctlons of different types ("and", "or", "but") 
LR-  referenclal pronouns ("these", "his") 
LP - prepositions with indication of implied semantic oases 
for different relations 
LD - "deflnitors" establishing paradlgmatlo relations between 
objects (."is", "denote", "contatln") 
LA - articles 
X - ignored or unknown lexames

3o The system s tar ts  i t s  operat ion  by runn ing  in i t ia l  
D-process which, f i r s t ,  makes acqua intance  with par t i cu le~ 
user  and, second, prompts him with the main menu to choose 
anon8 severa l  bas ic  ac t iv i t ies !  
(A) f i l l i ng  the 0B with the new ob jec ts  or modi fy ing the o ld 
ones !
(B) enter ing  par t i cu la r  problem-solvlng task!  
(C) get t ing  in fo rmat ion  on system components and processes .  
In  (A) one might concent ra te  on c reat ing  the new d ia l -  
o~e schemata which i s  done by bu i ld ing  new DP and DS-obJects.  
This spec ia l  k ind of ac t iv i ty  resu l t s  in  a new communication 
lansuage (sublauguage)  which might be immediate ly  tes ted  and 
used fo r  p ract i ca l  needs.  Another k ind  of (A) i s  connected 
with  the c reat ion  of  P0 and L -ob jec ts .  The user  can do i t  two 
d i f fe rent  w~s8 
- by enter ing  pat tern -cont ro l led  express ions  which de f ine  
par t i cu la r  ob ject  categories| 
- by ca l l ing  spec ia l  D-pro0esses respons ib le  fo r  bu i ld in  8 
appropz~lat ? ob jec ts .  
Although from the user ' s  s tandpo in t  hese a l te rnat ives  d i f fe r  
in  the  share of man-machine aot i~- l t ies ,  both of them are bas -  
ed on the same ru les  having the genera l  forms 
<pattern> \[= ~cond i t ion>~ ~ act ions  
~pat tern~ def ines  the combinat ion of ob jec t  ca tegor -  
ies  accepted from the user ,  no mat ter  i f  they come sequent ia l -  
l y  (one ob ject  per D-s ta te )  or s imu l taneous ly  - as one l ine  
of text .  Opt ional  Zcondi t ion~ a l lows checking par t i cu la~ 
proper t ies  of the accepted ob~ectso The ~ act ions~ emend 
the old ob jec ts  or c reate  the new ones.  A s imple ru le  might 
look as follbwlng= ? 
(X "0~ CI m~ C2)= ~t(X, "TP, "CP) 
Put (X, "OP, C1) l~t(X,  "IS, C2) l~t(C1, X, C2) 
Such a ru le  can handle the express ion :  "pres ident  of country  
i s  a po l i t i c ian"  which might be entered  in  one sentence or  
- 59  - 
spread over severa l  ASKVALI. The resu l t  would be c rent ion  of 
new CP-ob~eot "pres ident"  and mod i fy i~  the C-ob ject  "count ry" .  
In  (B) the change of in i t ia t ive  can be so f t ly  cont ro l l -  
ed by the user  in  the sense that  he should not apply spec ia l  
knowledge or  fee l  any bar r ie rs  when moving from one node of 
in teract ion  to another .  In  any mode, however, & resu l t  of ADM 
operat ion  i s  re f lec ted  in  F -express ion  /2 /  which car r ies  the 
semant ic  meaning of the input  sentence .  
Thus, fo r  example, a phrase "Defense min is ters  of NAT0 
met in  the cap i ta l  of France on October 18th" could be t rans -  
formed in to  the fo l low ing  F -express ions  
(Meetings par t i c ipants  (po l i t i c ian  (s ) :  
post de fense-min is ter  
from (count ry  (s)  = ELOF ~ATO)) 
p lace (cap i ta l  = 0F Francs)  
t ime (date = M October D 18) 
Such an express ion  i s  d i rec ted  to 1~ where i t  i s  in terpreted  
with  the resu l t  of  c reat ing /po in t ing  at  some nodes in  the 
te rmina l  semant ic  network thus represent ing  the meaning of  
the entered  text?
