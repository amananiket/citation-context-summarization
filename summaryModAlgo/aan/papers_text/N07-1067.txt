Abstract
This paper addresses the task of provid-
ing extended responses to questions re-
garding specialized topics. This task is an
amalgam of information retrieval, topical
summarization, and Information Extrac-
tion (IE). We present an approach which
draws on methods from each of these ar-
eas, and compare the effectiveness of this
approach with a query-focused summa-
rization approach. The two systems are
evaluated in the context of the prosecution
queries like those in the DARPA GALE
distillation evaluation.
1 Introduction
As question-answering systems advance from han-
dling factoid questions to more complex requests,
they must be able to determine how much informa-
tion to include while making sure that the informa-
tion selected is indeed relevant. Unlike factoid ques-
tions, there is no clear criterion that defines the kind
of phrase that answers the question; instead, there
may be many phrases that could make up an answer
and it is often unclear in advance, how many. As
system developers, our goal is to yield high recall
without sacrificing precision.
In response to questions about particular events of
interest that can be enumerated in advance, it is pos-
sible to perform a deeper semantic analysis focusing
on the entities, relations, and sub-events of interest.
On the other hand, the deeper analysis may be error-
ful and will also not always provide complete cov-
erage of the information relevant to the query. The
challenge, therefore, is to blend a shallower, robust
approach with the deeper approach in an effective
way.
In this paper, we show how this can be achieved
through a synergistic combination of information re-
trieval and information extraction. We interleave in-
formation retrieval (IR) and response generation, us-
ing IR in high precision mode in the first stage to
return a small number of documents that are highly
likely to be relevant. Information extraction of enti-
ties and events within these documents is then used
to pinpoint highly relevant sentences and associated
words are selected to revise the query for a sec-
ond pass of retrieval, improving recall. As part of
this process, we approximate the relevant context by
measuring the proximity of the target name in the
query and extracted events.
Our approach has been evaluated in the frame-
work of the DARPA GALE1 program. One of the
GALE evaluations involves responding to questions
based on a set of question templates, ranging from
broad questions like ?Provide information on X?,
where X is an organization, to questions focused on
particular classes of events. For the experiments pre-
sented here, we used the GALE program?s prosecu-
tion class of questions. These are given in the fol-
lowing form: ?Describe the prosecution of X for Y,?
where X is a person and Y is a crime or charge. Our
results show that we are able to achieve higher accu-

racy with a system that exploits the justice events
identified by IE than with an approach based on
query-focused summarization alone.
In the following sections, we first describe the
task and then review related work in question-
answering. Section 3 details our procedure for find-
ing answers as well as performing the information
retrieval and information extraction tasks. Section 4
compares the results of the two approaches. Finally,
we present our conclusion and plans for future work.
1.1 The Task
The language of the question immediately raises the
question of what is meant by prosecution. Unlike a
question such as ?When was X born??, which is ex-
pected to be answered by a clear, concrete phrase,
the prosecution question asks for a much greater
range of material. The answer is in no way limited
to the statements and activities of the prosecuting at-
torney, although these would certainly be part of a
comprehensive answer.
In the GALE relevance guidelines2 , the answer
can include many facets of the case:
? Descriptions of the accused?s involvement in
the crime.
? Descriptions of the activities, motivations, and
involvement in the crime.
? Descriptions of the person as long as they are
related to the trial.
? Information about the defense of the suspect.
? Information about the sentencing of the person.
? Information about similar cases involving the
person.
? Information about the arrest of the person and
statements made by him or her.
? Reactions of people involved in the trial, as
well as statements by officials or reactions by
the general public.
2BAE Systems Advanced Information Technologies, ?Rele-
vance Guidelines for Distillation Evaluation for GALE: Global
Autonomous Language Exploitation?, Version 2.2, January 25,
2007
The guidelines also provide a catchall instruction
to ?include reported information believed to be rele-
vant to the case, but deemed inadmissible in a court
of law.?
It is easy to see that the use of a few search terms
alone will be insufficient to locate a comprehensive
answer.
We took a broad view of the question type and
consider that any information about the investiga-
tion, accusation, pursuit, capture, trial and punish-
ment of the individual, whether a person or organi-
zation, would be desireable in the answer.
1.2 Overview
The first step in our procedure sends a query tai-
lored to this question type to the IR system to ob-
tain a small number of high-quality documents with
which we can determine what name variations are
used in the corpus and estimate how many docu-
ments contain references to the individual. In the
future we will expand the type of information we
want to glean from this small set of documents. A
secondary search is issued to find additional docu-
ments that refer to the individual, or individuals.
Once we have the complete document retrieval,
the foundation for finding these types of events
lies in the Proteus information extraction compo-
nent (Grishman et al, 2005). We employ an IE sys-
tem trained for the tasks of the 2005 Automatic Con-
tent Extraction evaluation, which include entity and
event extraction. ACE defines a number of general
event types, including justice events, which cover in-
dictments, accusations, arrests, trials, and sentenc-
ings. The union of all these specific categories gives
us many of the salient events in a criminal justice
case from beginning to end. The program uses the
events, as well as the entities, to help identify the
passages that respond to the question.
The selection of sentences is based on the as-
sumption that the co-occurrence of the target indi-
vidual and a judicial event indicates that the target
is indeed involved in the event, but these two do not
necesssarily occur in the same sentence.
2 Related Work
A large body of work in question-answering has fol-
lowed from the opening of the Text Retrieval Con-
533
ference?s Q&A track in 1999. The task started as a
group of factoid questions and expanded from there
into more sophisticated problems. TREC provides
a unique testbed of question-answer pairs for re-
searchers and this data has been influential in fur-
thering progress.
In TREC 2006, there was a new secondary task
called ?complex, interactive Question Answering,?
(Dang et al, 2006) which is quite close to the GALE
problem, though it incorporated interaction to im-
prove results. Questions are posed in a canonical
form plus a narrative elaborating on the kind of in-
formation requested. An example question (from the
TREC guidelines) asks, ?What evidence is there for
transport of [drugs] from [Bonaire] to the [United
States]?? Our task is most similar to the fully-
automatic baseline runs of the track, which typically
took the form of passage retrieval with query ex-
pansion (Oard et al, 2006) or synonym processing
(Katz et al, 2006), and not the deeper processing
employed in this work.
Within the broader QA task, the other question
type is closest to the requirements in GALE, but it
is too open ended. In TREC, the input for other
questions is the name or description of the target,
and the response is supposed to be all information
that did not fit in the answers to the previous ques-
tions. While a few GALE questions have similar in-
put, most, including the prosecution questions, pro-
vide more detail about the topic in question.
A number of systems have used techniques in-
spired by information extraction. One of the top sys-
tems in the other questions category at the 2004 and
2005 evaluations generated lexical-syntactic pat-
terns and semantic patterns (Schone et al, 2004).
But they build these patterns from the question. In
our task, we took advantage of the structured ques-
tion format to make use of extensive work on the
semantics of selected domains. In this way we
hope to determine whether we can obtain better per-
formance by adding more sophisticated knowledge
about these domains. The Language Computer Cor-
poration (LCC) has long experimented with incorpo-
rating information extraction techniques. Recently,
in its system for the other type questions at TREC
2005, LCC developed search patterns for 33 target
classes (Harabagiu et al, 2005). These patterns were
learned with features from WordNet, stemming and
named entity recognition.
More and more systems are exploiting the size
and redundancy of the Web to help find answers.
Some obtain answers from the Web and then
project the answer back to the test corpus to find
a supporting document (Voorhees and Dang, 2005).
LCC used ?web boosting features? to add to key
words (Harabagiu et al, 2005). Rather than go to
the Web and enhance the question terms, we made
a beginning at examining the corpus for specific bits
of information, in this prototype, to determine alter-
native realizations of names.
3 Implementation
As stated above, the system takes a query in the
XML format required by the GALE program. The
query templates allow users to amplify their requests
by specifying a timeframe for the information and/or
a locale. In addition, there are provisions for en-
tering synonyms or alternate terms for either of the
main arguments, i.e. the accused and the crime, and
for related but less important terms.
Since this system is a prototype written especially
for the GALE evaluation in July 2006, we paid close
attention to the way example questions were given,
as well as to the evaluation corpus, which consisted
of more than 600,000 short news articles. The goal
in GALE was to offer comprehensive results to the
user, providing all snippets, or segments of texts,
that responded to the information request. This re-
quired us to develop a strategy that balanced pre-
cision against recall. A system that reported only
high-confidence answers was in danger of having no
answers or far fewer answers than other systems,
while a system that allowed lower confidence an-
swers risked producing answers with a great deal of
irrelevant material. Another way to look at this bal-
ancing act was that it was necessary for a system to
know when to quit. For this reason, we sought to
obtain a good estimate of the number of documents
we wanted to scan for answers.
Answer selection focused first on the name of the
suspect, which was always given in the query tem-
plate. In many of the training cases, the suspect was
in the news only because of a criminal charge against
him; and in most, the charge specified was the only
accusation reported in the news. Both location and
534
date constraints seemed to be largely superfluous,
and so we ignored these. But we did have a mecha-
nism for obtaining supplementary answers keyed to
the brief description of the crime and other related
words
The first step in the process is to request a seed
collection of 10 documents from the IR system.
This number was established experimentally. The
IR query combines terms tailored to the prosecution
template and the specific template parameters for a
particular question. The 10 documents returned are
then examined to produce a list of name variations
that substantially match the name as rendered in the
query template. The IR system is then asked for the
number of times that the name appears in the cor-
pus. This figure is adjusted by the frequency per
document in the seed collection and a new query is
submitted, set to obtain the N documents in which
we expect to find the target?s name.
3.1 Information Retrieval
The goal of the information retrieval component of
the system was to locate relevant documents that the
summarization system could then use to construct an
answer. All search, whether high-precision or high-
recall, was performed using the Indri retrieval sys-
tem 3 (Strohman et al, 2005).
Indri provides a powerful query language that
is used here to combine numerous aspects of the
query. The Indri query regarding Saddam Hus-
sein?s prosecution for crimes against humanity in-
cludes the following components: source restric-
tions, prosecution-related words, mentions of Sad-
dam Hussein, justice events, dependence model
phrases (Metzler and Croft, 2005) regarding the
crime, and a location constraint.
The first part of the query located references to
prosecutions by looking for the keywords prosecu-
tion, defense, trial, sentence, crime, guilty, or ac-
cuse, all of which were determined on training data
to occur in descriptions of prosecutions. These
words were important to have in documents for them
to be considered relevant, but the individual?s name
and the description of the crime were far more im-
portant (by a factor of almost 19 to 1).
The more heavily weighted part of the query,
3http://lemurproject.org/indri
then, was a ?justice event? marker found using in-
formation extraction (Section 3.2) and the more de-
tailed description of that event based on phrases ex-
tracted from the crime (here crimes against human-
ity). Those phrases give more probability of rele-
vance to documents that use more terms from the
crime. It also included a location constraint (here,
Iraq) that boosted documents referring to that lo-
cation. And it captured user-provided equivalent
words such as Saddam Hussein being a synonym for
former President of Iraq.
The most complex part of the query handled ref-
erences to the individual. The extraction system had
annotated all person names throughout the corpus.
We used the IR system to index all names across
all documents and used Indri to retrieve any name
forms that matched the individual. As a result, we
were able to find references to Saddam, Hussein,
and so on. This task could have also been accom-
plished with cross-document coreference technol-
ogy but our approach appeared to compensate for
incorrectly translated names slightly better than the
coreference system we had available at the time. For
example, Present rust Hussein was one odd form
that was matched by our simple approach.The final query looked like the following:
#filreq( #syn( #1(AFA).source ... #1(XIE).source )
#weight(
0.05 #combine( prosecution defense trial sentence
crime guilty accuse )
0.95 #combine(
#any:justice
#weight(1.0 #combine(humanity against crimes)
1.0 #combine(
#1(against humanity)
#1(crimes against)
#1(crimes against humanity))
1.0 #combine
#uw8(against humanity)
#uw8(crimes humanity)
#uw8(crimes against)
#uw12(crimes against humanity)))
Iraq
#syn( #1(saddam hussein)
#1(former president iraq))
#syn( #equals( entity 126180 ) ...))))
The actual query is much longer because it con-
tains 100 possible entities and numerous sources.
The processing is described in more detail else-
where (Kumaran and Allan, 2007).
3.2 Information Extraction
The Proteus system produces the full range of anno-
tations as specified for the ACE 2005 evaluation, in-
cluding entities, values, time expressions, relations,
535
and events. We focus here on the two annotations,
entities and events, most relevant to our question-
answering task. The general performance on entity
and event detection in news articles is within a few
percentage points of the top-ranking systems from
the evaluation.
The extraction engine identifies seven semantic
classes of entities mentioned in a document, of
which the most frequent are persons, organizations,
and GPE?s (geo-political entities ? roughly, regions
with a government). Each entity will have one or
more mentions in the document; these mentions in-
clude names, nouns and noun phrases, and pro-
nouns. Text processing begins with an HMM-based
named entity tagger, which identifies and classifies
the names in the document. Nominal and pronomi-
nal mentions are identified either with a chunker or
a full Penn-Treebank parser. A rule-based coref-
erence component identifies coreference relations,
forming entities from the mentions. Finally, a se-
mantic classifier assigns a class to each entity based
on the type of the first named mention (if the entity
includes a named mention) or the head of the first
nominal mention (using statistics gathered from the
ACE training corpus).
The ACE annotation guidelines specify 33 differ-
ent event subtypes, organized into 8 major types.
One of the major types is justice events, which in-
clude arrest, charge, trial, appeal, acquit, convict,
sentence, fine, execute, release, pardon, sue, and ex-
tradite subtypes. In parallel to entities, the event
tagger first identifies individual event mentions and
then uses event coreference to form events. For the
ACE evaluation, an annotated corpus of approxi-
mately 300,000 words is used to train the event tag-
ger.
For each event mention in the corpus, we collect
the trigger word (the main word indicating the event)
and a pattern recording the path from the trigger
to each event argument. These paths are recorded
in two forms: as the sequence of heads of maxi-
mal constituents between the trigger and the argu-
ment, and as the sequence of predicate-argument re-
lations connecting the trigger to the argument4 . In
4These predicate argument relations are based on a repre-
sentation called GLARF (Grammatical-Logical Argument Rep-
resentation Framework), which incorporates deep syntactic re-
lations and the argument roles from PropBank and NomBank.
addition, a set of maximum-entropy classifiers are
trained: to distinguish events from non-events, to
classify events by type and subtype, to distinguish
arguments from non-arguments, and to classify ar-
guments by argument role. In tagging new data, we
first match the context of each instance of a trig-
ger word against the collected patterns, thus iden-
tifying some arguments. The argument classifier is
then used to collect additional arguments within the
sentence. Finally, the event classifier (which uses
the proposed arguments as features) is used to re-
ject unlikely events. The patterns provide somewhat
more precise matching, while the argument classi-
fiers improve recall, yielding a tagger with better
performance than either strategy separately.
3.3 Answer Generation
Once the final batch of documents is received,
the answer generator module selects candidate pas-
sages. The names, with alternate renderings, are lo-
cated through the entity mentions by the IE system.
All sentences that contain a justice event and that
fall within a mention of a target by no more than
n sentences, where n is a settable parameter, which
was put at 5 for this evaluation, form the core of the
system?s answer.
The tactic takes the place of topic segmentation,
which we used for other question types in GALE
that did not have the benefit of the sophisticated
event recognition offered by the IE system. Segmen-
tation is used to give users sufficient context in the
answer without needing a means of identifying dif-
ficult definite nominal resolution cases that are not
handled by extraction.
In order to increase recall, in keeping with the
need for a comprehensive answer in the GALE eval-
uation, we added sentences that contain the name of
the target in documents that have justice events and
sentences that contain words describing the crime.
However, we imposed a limitation on the growth of
the answer size. When the target individual is well-
known, he or she will be mentioned in numerous
contexts, reducing the likelihood that this additional
mention will be relevant. Thus, when the size of the
answer grew too rapidly, we stopped including these
additional sentences, and produced sentences only
from the justice events. The threshold for triggering
this shift was 200 sentences.
536
3.4 Summarization
As a state-of-the-art baseline, we used a generic
multidocument summarization system that has been
tested in numerous contexts. It is, indeed, the
backup answer generator for several question types,
including the prosecution questions, in our GALE
system, and has been been tested in the topic-based
tasks of the 2005 and 2006 Document Understand-
ing Conferences.
A topic statement is formed by collapsing the
template arguments into one list, e.g., ?saddam hus-
sein crimes against humanity prosecution?, and the
answer generation module proceeds by using a hy-
brid approach that combines top-down strategies
based on syntactic patterns, alongside a suite of
summarization methods which guide content in a
bottom-up manner that clusters and combines the
candidate sentences (Blair-Goldensohn and McKe-
own, 2006).
4 Evaluation
The results of our evaluation are shown in Table 1.
We increased the number of test questions over the
number used in the official GALE evaluation and we
used only previously unseen questions. Documents
for the baseline system were selected without use of
the event annotations from Proteus.
We paired the 25 questions for judges, so that both
the system?s answer and the baseline answer were
assigned to the same person. We provided explicit
instructions on the handling on implicit references,
allowing the judges to use the context of the ques-
tion and other answer sentences to determine if a
sentence was relevant ? following the practice of the
GALE evaluation.
Our judges were randomly assigned questions
and asked whether the snippets, which in our case
were individual sentences, were relevant or not;
they could respond Relevant, Not Relevant or Don?t
Know. In cases where references were unclear, the
judges were asked to choose Don?t Know and these
were removed from the scoring.5
5In the GALE evaluation, the snippets are broken down by
hand into nuggets ? discrete pieces of information ? and the
answers are scored on that basis. However, we scored our re-
sponses on the basis of snippets (sentences) only, as it is much
more efficient, and therefore more feasible to repeat in the fu-
ture.
Our system using IE event detection and en-
tity tracking outperformed the summarization-based
baseline, with average precision of 68% compared
with 57%. Moreover, the specialized system sus-
tained that level of precision although it returned a
much larger number of snippets, totaling 2,086 over
the 25 questions, compared with 363 for the base-
line system. We computed a relative recall score, us-
ing the union of the sentences found by the systems
and judged relevant as the ground truth. For recall,
the specialized system scored an average 89% ver-
sus 17% for the baseline system. Computing an F-
measure weighting precision and recall equally, the
specialized system outperformed the baseline sys-
tem 75% to 23%. The difference in relative recall
and F-measure are both statisticaly significant under
a two-tailed, paired t-test, with p < 0.001.
5 Conclusion and Future Work
Our results show that the specialized system statis-
tically outperforms the baseline, a well-tested query
focused summarization approach, on precision. The
specialized system produced a much larger answer
on average (Table 1). Moreover, our answer gener-
ator seemed to adapt well to information in the cor-
pus. Of the six cases where it returned fewer than
10 sentences, the baseline found no additional sen-
tences four times (Questions B006, B011, B015 and
B022). We regard this as an important property in
the question-answering task.
A major challenge is to ascertain whether the
mention of the target is indeed involved in the rec-
ognized justice event. Our event recognition system
was developed within the ACE program and only
seeks to assigns roles within the local context of a
single sentence. We currently use a threshold to con-
sider whether an entity mention is reliable, but we
will experiment with ways to measure the likelihood
that a particular sentence is about the prosecution or
some other issue. We are planning to obtain vari-
ous pieces of information from additional secondary
queries to the search engine. Within the GALE pro-
gram, we are limited to the defined corpus, but in the
general case, we could add more varied resources.
In addition, we are working to produce answers
using text generation, to bring more sophisticated
summarization techniques to make a better presen-

tem, against the focused-summarization baseline. This experiment is over 25 previously unseen questions.
The differences between the two systems are statistically significant (p < 0.001) for recall and f-measure by
a two-tailed, paired t-test. A big difference between the two systems is that the answer generator produces
a total of 2,086 answer sentences while sustaining an average precision of 0.684. In only three cases, does
the precision fall below 0.5. In contrast, the baseline system produced only 362, one-sixth the number of
answer sentences. While its average precision was not significantly worse than the answer-generator?s, its
precision varied widely, failing to find any correct sentences four times.

Finally, we will look into applying the techniques
used here on other topics. The first test would rea-
sonably be Conflict events, for which the ACE pro-
gram has training data. But ultimately, we would
like to adapt our system to arbitrary topic areas.
