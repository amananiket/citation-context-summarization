Abstract
In this paper we propose a novel statistical
language model to capture long-range se-
mantic dependencies. Specifically, we ap-
ply the concept of semantic composition to
the problem of constructing predictive his-
tory representations for upcoming words.
We also examine the influence of the un-
derlying semantic space on the composi-
tion task by comparing spatial semantic
representations against topic-based ones.
The composition models yield reductions
in perplexity when combined with a stan-
dard n-gram language model over the
n-gram model alone. We also obtain per-
plexity reductions when integrating our
models with a structured language model.
1 Introduction
Statistical language modeling plays an important
role in many areas of natural language process-
ing including speech recognition, machine trans-
lation, and information retrieval. The prototypi-
cal use of language models is to assign proba-
bilities to sequences of words. By invoking the
chain rule, these probabilities are generally es-
timated as the product of conditional probabili-
ties P(w
i
|h
i
) of a word w
i
given the history of
preceding words h
i
? w
i?1
1
. In theory, the history
could span any number of words up to w
i
such as
sentences or even a paragraphs. In practice, how-
ever, it has proven challenging to deal with the
combinatorial growth in the number of possible
histories which in turn impacts reliable parame-
ter estimation. A simple and effective strategy is
to truncate the chain rule to include only the n-1
preceding words (n is often set within the range
of 3?5). The simplification reduces the number of
free parameters. However, low values of n impose
an artificially local horizon to the language model,
and compromise its ability to capture long-range
dependencies, such as syntactic relationships, se-
mantic or thematic constraints.
The literature offers many examples of how to
overcome this limitation, essentially by allowing
the modulation of probabilities by dependencies
which extend to words beyond the n-gram horizon.
Cache language models (Kuhn and de Mori, 1992)
increase the probability of words observed in the
history, e.g., by some factor which decays expo-
nentially with distance. Trigger models (Rosen-
feld, 1996) go a step further by allowing arbi-
trary word pairs to be incorporated into the cache.
Structured language models (e.g., Roark (2001))
go beyond the representation of history as a lin-
ear sequence of words to capture the syntactic con-
structions in which these words are embedded.
It is also possible to build representations of
history which are semantic rather than syntactic
(Bellegarda (2000; Coccaro and Jurafsky (1998;
Gildea and Hofmann (1999)). In this approach, es-
timates for the probabilities of upcoming words
are derived from a comparison of their semantic
content with the content of the history so far. The
semantic representations, in this case, are vectors
derived from the distributional properties of words
in a corpus, based on the insight that words which
are semantically similar will be found in similar
contexts (Harris, 1968; Firth, 1957). Although the
the construction of a semantic representation for
the history is crucial to this approach, the under-
lying vector-based models are primarily designed
to represent isolated words rather than word se-
quences. Ideally, we would like to compose the
meaning of the history out of its constituent parts.
This is by no means a new idea. Much work in lin-
guistic theory (Partee, 1995; Montague, 1974) has
been devoted to compositionality, the process of
determining the meaning of complex expressions
from simpler ones. Previous work either ignores
this issue (e.g., Bellegarda (2000)) or simply com-
430
putes the centroid of the vectors representing the
history (e.g., Coccaro and Jurafsky (1998)). This is
motivated primarily by mathematical convenience
rather than by empirical evidence.
In our earlier work (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008)
we formulated composition as a function of two
vectors and introduced a variety of models based
on addition and multiplication. In this paper we
apply vector composition to the problem of con-
structing predictive history representations for lan-
guage modeling. Besides integrating composition
with language modeling, a task which is novel to
our knowledge, our approach also serves as a valu-
able testbed of our earlier framework which we
originally evaluated on a small scale verb-subject
similarity task. We also investigate how the choice
of the underlying semantic representation inter-
acts with the choice of composition function by
comparing a spatial model that represents words
as vectors in a high-dimensional space against a
probabilistic model that represents words as topic
distributions.
Our results show that the proposed composi-
tion models yield reductions in perplexity when
combined with a standard n-gram model over
the n-gram model alone. We also show that with
an appropriate composition function spatial mod-
els outperform the more sophisticated topic mod-
els. Finally, we obtain further perplexity reduc-
tions when our models are integrated with a struc-
tured language model, indicating that the two ap-
proaches to language modeling are complemen-
tary.
2 Background
2.1 Distributional Models of Semantics
The insight that words with similar meanings will
tend to be distributed in similar contexts has given
rise to a number of approaches that construct
semantic representations from corpora. Broadly
speaking, these models come in two flavors. Se-
mantic space models represent the meaning of
words in terms of vectors, with the vector compo-
nents being derived from the distributional statis-
tics of those words. Essentially, these models pro-
vide a simple procedure for constructing spatial
representations of word meaning. Topic models, in
contrast, impose a probabilistic model onto those
distributional statistics, under the assumption that
hidden topic variables drive the process that gener-
ates words. Both approaches represent the mean-
ings of words in terms of an n-dimensional series
of values, but whereas the semantic space model
treats those values as defining a vector with spatial
properties, the topic model treats them as a proba-
bility distribution.
A simple and popular (McDonald, 2000; Bul-
linaria and Levy, 2007; Lowe, 2000) way to con-
struct a semantic space model is to associate each
vector component with a particular context word,
and assign it a value based on the strength of
its co-occurrence with the target (i.e., the word
for which a semantic representation is being con-
structed). For example, in Mitchell and Lapata
(2008) we used the 2,000 most frequent content
words in a corpus as their contexts, and defined
co-occurrence in terms of the context word be-
ing present in a five word window on either side
of the target word. We calculated the ratio of the
probability of the context word given the target
word to the overall probability of the context word
and use these values as their vector components.
This procedure has the benefits of simplicity and
also of being largely free of any additional the-
oretical assumptions over and above the distribu-
tional approach to semantics. This is not to say that
more sophisticated approaches have not been de-
veloped or that they are not useful. Much work has
been devoted to enriching semantic space mod-
els with syntactic information (e.g., Grefenstette
(1994; Pad?o and Lapata (2007)), selectional pref-
erences (Erk and Pad?o, 2008) or with identifying
optimal ways of defining the vector components
(e.g., Bullinaria and Levy (2007)).
The semantic space discussed thus far is based
on word co-occurrence statistics. However, the
statistics of how words are distributed across the
documents also carry useful semantic informa-
tion. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA, Landauer
and Dumais (1997) utilizes precisely this distribu-
tional information to uncover hidden semantic fac-
tors by means of dimensionality reduction. Singu-
lar value decomposition (SVD, Berry et al (1994))
is applied to a word-document co-occurrence ma-
trix which is factored into a product of a number
of other matrices; one of them represents words in
terms of the semantic factors and another repre-
sents documents in terms of the same factors. The
algebraic relation between these matrices can be
used to show that any document vector is a linear
combination of the vectors representing the words
it contains. Thus, within this paradigm it is nat-
431
ural to treat multi-word structures as a ?pseudo-
document? and represent them via linear combi-
nations of word vectors.
Due to its generality, LSA has proven a valuable
analysis tool with a wide range of applications.
However, the SVD procedure is somewhat ad-hoc
lacking a sound statistical foundation. Probabilis-
tic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA, Hofmann
(2001)) casts the relationship between documents
and words in terms of a generative model based on
a set of hidden topics. Documents are represented
by distributions over topics and topics are distri-
butions over words. Thus the mixture of topics
in any document determines its vocabulary. Maxi-
mum likelihood estimation of these distributions
over a word-document matrix has a comparable
effect to SVD in LSA: a set of hidden semantic
factors, in this case topics, are extracted and docu-
ments and words are represented by these topics.
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Griffiths et al,
2007; Blei et al, 2003) enhances further the math-
ematical foundation of this approach. Whereas
pLSA treats each document as a separate, inde-
pendent mixture of topics, LDA assumes that the
topic distributions of documents are generated by
a Dirichlet distribution. Thus, LDA is a probabilis-
tic model of the whole document collection. In this
model the process of generating a document can
be described as follows:
1. draw a multinomial distribution ? from a
Dirichlet distribution parametrized by ?
2. for each word in a document:
(a) draw a topic z
k
from the multinomial
distribution characterized by ?
(b) draw a word from a multinomial distri-
bution conditioned on the topic z
k
and
word probabilities ?
Under this model, constructing a representation
for a multi-word sequence amounts to estimating
the topic proportions for that sequence.
1
Struc-
ture here arises from the mathematical form of the
model, as opposed to any linguistic assumptions.
Without anticipating our results too much, we
should point out that several features of the LDA
model are likely to affect the representation of
1
Estimating the posterior distribution P(?,z|w,?,?) of
the hidden variables given an observed collection of docu-
ments w is intractable in general; however, a variety of ap-
proximate inference algorithms have been proposed in the
literature (e.g., Blei et al (2003; Griffiths et al (2007)).
multi-word sequences. Firstly, it is a top-down
generative model (the topic proportions for a doc-
ument are first selected and then this drives the
generation of words) as opposed to a bottom-up
constructive process (words modulate each other
to produce a complex representation of their com-
bination). Secondly, the top level Dirichlet distri-
bution is likely to lead to documents being dom-
inated by a small number of topics, producing
sparse vectors. And lastly, the assumption that
words are generated independently means the in-
teraction between them is not modeled.
2.2 Language Modeling using Semantic
Representations
A common approach to embedding semantic rep-
resentations within language modeling is to mea-
sure the semantic similarity between an upcoming
word and its history and use it to modify the prob-
abilities from an n-gram model. In this way, the
n-gram?s sensitivity to short-range dependencies
is enriched with information about longer-range
semantic coherence. Much of previous work has
taken this approach (Bellegarda, 2000; Coccaro
and Jurafsky, 1998; Wandmacher and Antoine,
2007), whilst relying on LSA to provide seman-
tic representations for individual words. Some au-
thors (Coccaro and Jurafsky, 1998; Wandmacher
and Antoine, 2007) use the geometric notion of
a vector centroid to construct representations of
history, whereas others (Bellegarda, 2000; Deng
and Khundanpur, 2003) use the idea of a ?pseudo-
document?, which is derived from the algebraic
relation between documents and words assumed
within LSA. They all derive P(w
i
|h
i
), the probabil-
ity of an upcoming word given its history, from the
cosine similarity measure which must be somehow
normalized in order to yield well-formed probabil-
ity estimates.
The approach of Gildea and Hofmann (1999)
overcomes this difficulty by using representations
constructed with pLSA, which have a direct prob-
abilistic interpretation. As a result, the probabil-
ity of an upcoming word given the history can be
derived naturally and directly, avoiding the need
for ad-hoc transformations. In constructing their
representation of history, Gildea and Hofmann
(1999) use an online Expectation Maximization
process, which derives from the probabilistic basis
of pLSA, to update the history with new words.
Extensions on the basic semantic language
432
models sketched above involve representing the
history by multiple LSA models of varying granu-
larity in an attempt to capture topic, subtopic, and
local information (Zhang and Rudnicky, 2002); in-
corporating syntactic information by building the
semantic space over words and their syntactic an-
notations (Kanejiya et al, 2004); and treating the
LSA similarity as a feature in a maximum entropy
language model (Deng and Khundanpur, 2003).
3 Composition Models
The problem of vector composition has re-
ceived relatively little attention within natural lan-
guage processing. Attempts to use tensor products
(Smolensky, 1990; Clark et al, 2008; Widdows,
2008) as a means of binding one vector to another
face major computational difficulties as their di-
mensionality grows exponentially with the num-
ber of constituents being composed. To overcome
this problem, other techniques (Plate, 1995) have
been proposed in which the binding of two vectors
results in a vector which has the same dimension-
ality as its components. Crucially, the success of
these methods depends on the assumption that the
vector components are randomly distributed. This
is problematic for modeling language which has
regular structure.
Given the above considerations, in Mitchell and
Lapata (2008) we introduce a general framework
for studying vector composition, which we formu-
late as a function f of two vectors u and v:
h= f (u,v) (1)
where h denotes the composition of u and v. Dif-
ferent composition models arise, depending on
how f is chosen. Our earlier work (Mitchell and
Lapata, 2008) explored two broad classes of mod-
els based on additive and multiplicative functions.
Additive models are the most common method
of vector combination in the literature. They have
been applied to a wide variety of tasks includ-
ing document coherence (Foltz et al, 1998), es-
say grading (Landauer and Dumais, 1997), mod-
eling selectional restrictions (Kintsch, 2001), and
notably language modeling (Coccaro and Jurafsky,
1998; Wandmacher and Antoine, 2007):
h
i
= u
i
+ v
i
(2)
Vector addition (or averaging, which is equivalent
under the cosine similarity measure) is a computa-
tionally efficient composition model as it does not
increase the dimensionality of the resulting vector.
However, the idea of averaging is somewhat coun-
terintuitive from a linguistic perspective. Compo-
sition of simple elements onto more complex ones
must allow the construction of novel meanings
which go beyond those of the individual elements
(Pinker, 1994).
In Mitchell and Lapata (2008) we argue that
composition models based on multiplication ad-
dress this problem:
h
i
= u
i
? v
i
(3)
Whereas the addition of vectors ?lumps their con-
tent together?, multiplication picks out the content
relevant to their combination by scaling each com-
ponent of one with the strength of the correspond-
ing component of the other. This argument is ap-
pealing, especially if one is interested in explain-
ing how the meaning of a verb is modulated by
its subject. Here, we also develop a complemen-
tary, probabilistic argument for the validity of this
model.
Let us assume that semantic vectors are based
on components defined as the ratio of the condi-
tional probability of a context word given the tar-
get word to the overall probability of the context
word.
v
i
=
p(context
i
|target)
p(context
i
)
(4)
These vectors represent the distributional proper-
ties of a given target word in terms of the strength
of its co-occurrence with a set of context words.
Dividing through by the overall probability of each
context word prevents the vectors being dominated
by the most frequent context words, which will of-
ten also have the highest conditional probabilities.
Let us assume vectors u and v represent tar-
get words w
1
and w
2
. Now, when we compose
these vectors using the multiplicative model and
the components definition in (4), we obtain:
h
i
= v
i
?u
i
=
p(c
i
|w
1
)
p(c
i
)
p(c
i
|w
2
)
p(c
i
)
(5)
And by Bayes? theorem:
h
i
=
p(w
1
|c
i
)p(w
2
|c
i
)
p(w
1
)p(w
2
)
(6)
Assuming w
1
and w
2
are independent and apply-
ing Bayes? theorem again, h
i
becomes:
h
i
?
p(w
1
w
2
|c
i
)
p(w
1
w
2
)
=
p(c
i
|w
1
w
2
)
p(c
i
)
(7)
433
By comparing to (4), we can see that the expres-
sion on the right hand side gives us something akin
to the vector components we would expect when
our target is the co-occurrence of w
1
and w
2
. Thus,
for the multiplicative model, the combined vec-
tor h
i
can be thought of as an approximation to
a vector representing the distributional properties
of the phrase w
1
w
2
.
If multiplication results in a vector which is
something like the representation of w
1
and w
2
,
then addition produces a vector which is more like
the representation of w
1
or w
2
. Suppose we were
unsure whether a word token x was an instance
of w
1
or of w
2
. It would be reasonable to express
the probabilities of context words around this to-
ken in terms of the probabilities for w
1
and w
2
,
assuming complete uncertainty between them:
p(c
i
|x) =
1
2
p(c
i
|w
1
)+
1
2
p(c
i
|w
2
) (8)
Therefore, we could represent x with a vector,
based on these probabilities, having the compo-
nents:
x
i
=
1
2
p(c
i
|w
1
)
p(c
i
)
+
1
2
p(c
i
|w
2
)
p(c
i
)
(9)
Which is exactly the vector averaging approach to
semantic composition. As more vectors are com-
bined, vector addition will lead to greater general-
ity rather than greater specificity. The multiplica-
tive approach, on the other hand, picks out the
components of the constituents that are relevant
to the combination, and represents more faithfully
the properties of their conjunction.
As an aside, we should point out that our earlier
work (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008) introduced sev-
eral other models, additive and multiplicative, be-
sides the ones discussed here. We selected the ad-
ditive model as a baseline and also due to its over-
whelming popularity in the language modeling lit-
erature. The multiplicative model presented above
performed best in our evaluation study (i.e., pre-
dicting verb-subject similarity).
4 Language Modeling
Estimating Probabilities In language modeling
our aim is to derive probabilities, p(w|h), given
the semantic representations of word, w, and its
history, h, based on the assumption that probable
words should be semantically coherent with the
history. Semantic coherence is commonly mea-
sured via the cosine of the angle between two vec-
tors:
sim(w,h) =
w ?h
|w||h|
(10)
w ?h=
?
i
w
i
h
i
(11)
where w ? h is the dot product of w and h. Coc-
caro and Jurafsky (1998) utilize this measure in
their approach to language modeling. Unfortu-
nately, they find it necessary to resort to a number
of ad-hoc mechanisms to turn the cosine similari-
ties into useful probabilities. The primary problem
with the cosine measure is that, although its values
lie between 0 and 1, they do not sum to 1, as prob-
abilities must. Thus, some form of normalization
is required. A further problem concerns the fact
that such a measure takes no account of the under-
lying frequency of w, which is crucial for a proba-
bilistic model. For example, encephalon and brain
are roughly synonymous, and may be equally sim-
ilar to some context, but brain may nonetheless be
much more likely, as it is generally more common.
An ideal measure would take account of the un-
derlying probabilities of the elements involved and
produce values that sum to 1. Our approach is to
modify the dot product (equation (11)) on which
the cosine measure is based. Assuming that our
vector components are given by equation (4), the
dot product becomes:
w ?h=
?
i
p(c
i
|w)
p(c
i
)
p(c
i
|h)
p(c
i
)
(12)
which we modify to derive probabilities as fol-
lows:
p(w|h) = p(w)
?
i
p(c
i
|w)
p(c
i
)
p(c
i
|h)
p(c
i
)
p(c
i
) (13)
This expression now weights the sum with the in-
dependent probabilities of the context words and
the word to be predicted. That this is indeed a valid
probability can be seen by the fact it is equiva-
lent to
?
i
p(w|c
i
)p(c
i
|h). However, in constructing
a representation of the history h, it is more conve-
nient to work with equation (13) as it is based on
vector components and can be readily used with
the composition models presented in Mitchell and
Lapata (2008).
Equation (13) allows us to derive probabilities
from vectors representing a word and its prior his-
tory. We must also construct a representation of
434
the history up to the nth word of a sentence. To do
this, we combine, via some (additive or multiplica-
tive) function f , the vector representing that word
with the vector representing the history up to n?1
words:
h
n
= f (w
n
,h
n?1
) (14)
h
1
= w
1
(15)
One issue that must be resolved in implement-
ing equation (14) is that the history vector should
remain correctly normalized. In other words, the
products h
i
? p(c
i
) must themselves be a valid dis-
tribution over context words. So, after each vec-
tor composition the history vector is normalized
as follows:
h
i
=
?
h
i
?
j
?
h
j
? p(c
i
)
(16)
Equations (13)?(16) define a language model
that incorporates vector composition. To generate
probability estimates, it requires a set of word vec-
tors whose components are based on the ratio of
probabilities described by equation (4).
Our discussion thus far has assumed a spatial
semantic space model similar to that employed in
Mitchell and Lapata (2008). However, there is no
reason why the vectors should not be constructed
by some other means. As mentioned earlier, in the
LDA topic model, words are represented as dis-
tributions over topics. These distributions are es-
sentially components of a vector v corresponding
to the target word for which we wish to construct
a semantic representation. Analogously to equa-
tion (4), we convert these probabilities to ratios of
probabilities:
v
i
=
p(topic
i
|target)
p(topic
i
)
(17)
Integrating with Other LanguageModels The
models defined above are based on little more than
semantic coherence. As such they will be only
weakly predictive, since they largely ignore word
order, which n-grammodels primarily exploit. The
simplest means to integrate semantic information
with a standard language model involves combin-
ing two probability estimates as a weighted sum:
p(w|h) = ?
1
p
1
(w|h)+(1??)p
2
(w|h) (18)
Linear interpolation is guaranteed to produce
valid probabilities, and has been used, for exam-
ple, to integrate structured language models with
n-gram models (Roark, 2001). However, it will
work best when the models being combined are
roughly equally predictive and have complemen-
tary strengths and weaknesses. If one model is
much weaker than the other, linear interpolation
will typically produce a model of intermediate
strength (i.e., worse than the better model), with
the weaker model contributing a form of smooth-
ing at best.
Therefore, based on equation (13), we express
our semantic probabilities as the product of the
unigram probability, p(w), and a semantic com-
ponent, ?, which determines the factor by which
this probability should be scaled up or down given
the context in which it occurs.
p(w|h) = p(w) ??(w,h) (19)
?(w,h) =
?
i
p(c
i
|w)
p(c
i
)
p(c
i
|h)
p(c
i
)
p(c
i
) (20)
Thus, it seems reasonable to integrate the n-gram
model by replacing the unigram probabilities with
the n-gram versions.
2
p?(w
n
) = p(w
n
|w
n?1
n?2
) ??(w
n
,h) (21)
To obtain a true probability estimate we normalize
p?(w
n
) by dividing through the sum of all word
probabilities:
p(w
n
|w
n?1
n?2
,h) =
p?(w
n
)
?
w
p?(w)
(22)
In integrating our semantic model with an n-gram
model, we allow the latter to handle short range
dependencies and have the former handle the
longer dependencies outside the n-gram window.
For this reason, the history h used by the semantic
model in the prediction of w
n
only includes words
up to w
n?3
(i.e., only words outside the n-gram).
We also integrate our models with a structured
language model (Roark, 2001). However, in this
case we use linear interpolation (equation (18))
because the models are roughly equally predic-
tive and also because linear interpolation is widely
used when structured language models are com-
bined with n-grams and other information sources.
This approach also has the benefit of allowing the

1999).
435
models to be combined without out the need to
renormalize the probabilities. In the case of the
structured language model, normalizing across the
whole vocabulary would be prohibitive.
5 Experimental Setup
In this section we discuss our experimental design
for assessing the performance of the models pre-
sented above. We give details on our training pro-
cedure and parameter estimation, and present the
methods used for comparison with our approach.
Method Following previous work (e.g., Belle-
garda (2000)) we integrated our compositional
language models with a standard n-gram model
(see equation (21)). We experimented with addi-
tive and multiplicative composition functions, and
two semantic representations (LDA and the sim-
pler semantic space model), resulting in four com-
positional models. In addition, we compared our
models against a state of the art structured lan-
guage model in order to assess the extent to which
the information provided by the semantic repre-
sentation is complementary to syntactic structure.
Our experiments used Roark?s (2001) grammar-
based language model. Similarly to standard lan-
guage models, it computes the probability of the
next word based upon the previous words of the
sentence. This is done by computing a subset of all
possible grammatical relations for the prior words
and then estimating the probability of the next
grammatical structure and the probability of see-
ing the next word given each of the prior gram-
matical relations. When estimating the probability
of the next word, the model conditions on the two
prior heads of constituents, thereby using informa-
tion about word triples (like a trigram model).
All our models were evaluated by computing
perplexity on the test set. Roughly, this quanti-
fies the degree of unpredictability in a probabil-
ity distribution, such that a fair k-sided dice would
have a perplexity of k. More precisely, perplexity
is the reciprocal of the geometric average of the
word probabilities and a lower score indicates bet-
ter predictions.
Parameter Estimation The compositional lan-
guage models were trained on the BLLIP corpus,
a collection of texts from the Wall Street Journal
(years 1987?89). The training corpus consisted of
38,521,346 words. We used a development corpus
of 50,006 words and a test corpus of similar size.
All words were converted to lowercase and num-
bers were replaced with the symbol ?num?. A vo-
cabulary of 20,000 words was chosen and the re-
maining tokens were replaced with ?unk?.
Following Mitchell and Lapata (2008), we con-
structed a simple semantic space based on co-
occurrence statistics from the BLLIP training set.
We used the 2,000 most frequent word types as
contexts and a symmetric five word window. Vec-
tor components were defined as in equation (4).
Contrary to our earlier work, we did not lemma-
tize the corpus before constructing the vectors as
in the context of language modeling this was not
appropriate. We also trained the LDA model on
BLLIP, using Blei et al?s (2003) implementation.
3
We experimented with different numbers of topics
on the development set (from 10 to 200) and re-
port results on the test set with 100 topics. In our
experiments, the hyperparameter ? was initialized
to 0.5, and the ? word probabilities were initial-
ized randomly.
We integrated our compositional models with a
trigram model which we also trained on BLLIP.
The model was built using the SRILM toolkit
(Stolcke, 2002) with backoff and Good-Turing
smoothing. Ideally, we would have liked to train
Roark?s (2001) parser on the same data as that
used for the semantic models. However, this would
require a gold standard treebank several times
larger than those currently available. Following
previous work on structured language modeling
(Roark, 2001; Charniak, 2001; Chelba and Jelinek,
1998), we therefore trained the parser on sections
2?21 of the Penn Treebank containing 936,017
words. Note that Roark?s (2001) parser produces
prefix probabilities for each word of a sentence
which we converted to conditional probabilities by
dividing each current probability by the previous
one.
6 Results
Table 1 shows perplexity results when the com-
positional models are combined with an n-gram
model. With regard to the simple semantic space
model (SSM) we observe that both additive and
multiplicative approaches to constructing history
are successful in reducing perplexity over the
n-gram baseline, with the multiplicative model
outperforming the additive one. This confirms the

hypothesis that for this type of semantic space the
multiplicative vector combination function pro-
duces representations which have a sounder prob-
abilistic basis.
The results for the LDA model are also reported
in the table. This model reduces perplexity with an
additive composition function, but performs worse
than the n-gram with a multiplicative function. For
comparison, Figure 1 plots the perplexity of the
combined LDA and n-gram models against the
number of topics. Increasing the number of top-
ics produces higher dimensional representations
which ought to be richer, more detailed and there-
fore more predictive. While this is true for the
additive model, a greater number of topics actu-
ally increases the perplexity of the multiplicative
model, indicating it has become less predictive.
We compared these perplexity reductions
against those obtained with a structured lan-
guage model. Following Roark (2001), we com-
bined the structured language model with a
trigram model using linear interpolation (the
weights were optimized on the development
set). This model (n-gram + parser) performs
comparably to our best compositional model
(n-gram + Multiply
SSM
). While both models in-
corporate long range dependencies, the parser is
trained on a hand annotated treebank, whereas the
compositional model uses raw text, albeit from
a larger corpus. Interestingly, when interpolating
the trigram with the parser and the compositional
models, we obtain additional perplexity reduc-
tions. This suggests that the semantic models are

encoding useful predictive information about long
range dependencies, which is distinct from and po-
tentially complementary to the parser?s syntactic
information about such dependencies. Note that
the semantic space multiplicative model yields the
highest perplexity reduction in this suite of exper-
iments followed by the LDA additive model.
7 Conclusions
In this paper we advocated the use of vector
composition models for language modeling. Us-
ing semantic representations of words outside the
n-gram window, we enhanced a trigram model
with longer range dependencies. We compared
composition models based on addition and multi-
plication and examined the influence of the under-
lying semantic space on the composition task. Our
results indicate that the multiplicative composition
function produced the most predictive representa-
tions with a simple semantic space. Interestingly,
its effect in the LDA setting was detrimental. In-
creasing the representational power of the LDA
model, by using a greater number of topics, ren-
dered the multiplicative model less predictive.
These results, together with the basic mathe-
matical structure of the LDA model, suggest that
it may not be well suited to forming represen-
tations for word sequences. In particular, the as-
sumption that words are generated independently
within documents prevents the interactions be-
tween words being modeled. This assumption,
along with the Dirichlet prior on document distri-
butions tends to lead to highly sparse word vec-
437
tors, with a typical word being strongly associated
with only one or two topics. Multiplication of a
number of these vectors generally produces a vec-
tor in which most of these associations have been
obliterated by the sparse components, resulting in
a representation with little predictive power.
These shortcomings arise from the mathemati-
cal formulation of LDA, which is not directed at
modeling the semantic interaction between words.
An interesting future direction would be to opti-
mize the vector components of the probabilistic
model over a suitable training corpus, in order to
derive a vector model of semantics adapted specif-
ically to the task of composition. We also plan to
investigate more sophisticated composition mod-
els that take syntactic structure into account. Our
results on interpolating the compositional mod-
els with a parser indicate that there is substantial
mileage to be gained by combining syntactic and
semantic dependencies.
