1 Introduction 
Interactive user environments have been a central efficiency- 
enhancing feature of many modem computer applications, 
including natural anguage processing. There are two ma- 
jor classes of users for whom NLP environments can be 
constructed - - developers and end users, such as technical 
writers and translators. Developers need help in the various 
knowledge acquisition tasks, such as dictionary and grammar 
writing for NLP applications. End users look for efficiency 
enhancements in document preparation beyond the level of 
word processing support. There are two approaches to the 
solution of this problem. A dedicated workstation can be de- 
veloped for each of the required functionalities. Alternatively, 
workstations can be configured as sets of application routines 
attached to a universal user interface. 
In this report we describe a general-purpose user environ- 
ment, under development a  the Center for Machine Transla- 
tion of Carnegie Mellon University, capable of supporting a 
number of dedicated workstation configurations. Among the 
types of end users whom this system will benefit are techni- 
cal writers, text revisors and translators. In the framework 
of NLP system development this tool supports dictionary and 
ontology acquisition. 
A number of separate functionalities included in this system 
have been developed and used either in commercial word pro- 
cessing software packages or in NLP projects (e.g., the transla- 
tor's tools described in Macklovitch, 1989, ;and the developer 
environments IRACQ (Ayuso et al, 1987), LUKE (Wrob- 
iewski and Rich, 1988) or ONTOS (Monarch and Nirenburg, 
1989), among many others). Our system allows a merge of 
the two directions in the tool development. One direct reason 
to put the two previously separate kinds of functionality into a 
single system was to support he knowledge-based machine- 
aided translation environment which involves an interactive 
human editor who uses an interface to help the machine un- 
derstand the source text. 
A standard Unix- and X-windows-based workstation plat- 
form has been selected for our system, whose working name 
is Tws, for "Translator's Workstation." We also used the 
C-based X11 toolkit called MOTIF (Motif, 1991) and its Com- 
monLisp interface called CLM (Babatz et. al., 1991). In prac- 
tice, TWS consists of a number of application (functionality) 
modules which are integrated through the central MOTIF-based 
user interface module. For reasons of uniformity, each of the 
applications uses the facilities of the user interface for display 
and input. Each module uses a standard window to interact 
with the user, and each window has standard menus which, 
among other functionalities, allow the user to invoke any other 
module. Each module also has special menus. 
The architecture of TWS is presented inFigure 1.

Figure 1" TWS architecture. The system was designed to 
make it easy to plug new modules into TWS. 
We illustrate the basic interface and several application util- 
ities that have been connected to the TWS. Specifically, we 
illustrate the text editor (an end-user functionality), the utility 
for statistical processing of corpora (useful both for end users 
and for developers) and the ontology acquisition and mainte- 
nance tool, based on ONTOS (a developer functionality). 
Due to the lack of space, we do not describe our interface to 
reference sources, such as online dictionaries or user-defined 
glossaries, or our interface-building interface which allows 
both the TWS developer and TWS user define and modify the 
user interfaces the system uses. 
TWS is designed in such a way that various utilities can be 
imported into the system, so that there is no need to imple- 
ment every functionality locally. One example of an existing 
imported module in TWS is a set of bilingual text alignment 
routines. The concept of importing utilities is very important 
to our work. The user interface facilities of the kind we de- 
veloped makes it easy to import applications with a minimum 
of effort and with a capability of making them "look and feel" 
similarly to the rest of the applications in the system. In our 
future work we intend to mix the development of utilities with 
importing and integrating existing applications, whenever that 
is desirable and feasible. 
Figure 2 shows a basic editing window of TWS. The central 
feature of the TWS editor is its capability to emulate various 
existing word processors. This feature is important from the 
standpoint of acceptance of the workstation environments by 
TM end users. Currently the editor emulates WORD PERFECI" 
and EMACS. 
Figure 3 illustrates the corpus processing functionality. It 
can be used by end users to compare the usage of a term in 
various places in a set of documents and by the developer to 
gain insights for dictionary and ontology acquisition.

A detailed discussion of the ONTOS system see in 
Monarch, 1989, Carlson and Nirenburg, 1991. To include 
the ONTOS functionality into TWS, a new grapher has been 
built. The grapher facilitates browsing through, editing, cre- 
ating and deleting frames. An important feature is its ability 
to handle graphs rather than trees, so that multiple inheri- 
tance can be graphically represented. The ONTOS module 
inside TWS also supports a structured editor for manipulating 
ontological concepts ymbolically.

select portions of the ontology to display. 
We believe that the TWS GRAPHER compares favorably with 
other graphers, notably the AGGREGRAPHS (See Dannenberg 
et. al., 1991) which is part of the GARNET system and the ISI 
GRAPHER (see Robins, 1988). Unlike AGGREGRAPHS, which 
can only display a knowledge base, our grapher lets the user 
edit it. As for the ISI GRAPHER, the latter cannot easily support 
more than one type of link between odes, while the I~/s 
grapher can support an unlimited number of links, as well as 
validity and consistency tests for them. 
2 Conc lus ions  
Our work on TWS is continuing. At the time of this writing, 
several additional functionalities are being developed, includ- 
ing a machine-tractable lexicon acquisition module and a user 
interface system for a machine-aided translation environment, 
a descendent of the augmentor module of the KBMT-89 MT 
system (Brown, 1991). On the end-user side, a general text 
alignment facility is being developed, which will support the 
work of mono- and multilingual document revisors by pin- 
pointing the differences among different versions of a docu- 
ment.
