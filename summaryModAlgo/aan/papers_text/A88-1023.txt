ABSTRACT 
This paper  descr ibes a valency model, 
developed wi th in  the Belg ian METAL project, 
a imed at enhanc ing the modular i ty  and 
mult i l ingua l i ty  of the METAL system. The 
introduct ion provides background, sect ion 1 
d iscusses the ex is t ing valency framework, and 
sect ion 2 presents the a l ternat ive model. 
The final sect ion deals with some results and 
problems with this model. 
0. Int roduct ion 
The task of MT is to map between equivalent 
l inguist ic  objects. One of the central  design 
quest ions in MT is that of the best method to 
decompose the t rans lat ion relation. The ideal 
would be to have a system that produces a 
(natural) language- independent  representat ion 
from a source language (SL) text, which could 
then be synthes ized in any target language 
(TL). However, this ideal not being feasible 
for rea l -wor ld  texts, it has become customary 
to adopt a model where a transfer  module, 
speci f ic  to one language pair, def ines a 
mapping between language-dependent  structural 
representat ions.  In pr inc ip le it should be 
poss ib le to des ign a 'transfer' model in such 
a way that the analysis module for mapping 
surface str ings onto structural 
representat ions and the synthesis module for 
mapping structural  representat ions onto 
surface strings remain the same, regardless of 
the TL and SL, respectively.  The advantage of 
this 'mult i l ingual '  design is that ex ist ing 
modules wil l  not be ser iously af fected by the 
addit ion of a new language to the system. A 
still more attractive, but also more 
ambitious, design would be one in which the 
same grammar can be used for both pars ing and 
generating, and the same translat ion rules for 
t rans lat ing between two languages in either 
d i rect ion (see J in and Simmons, 1986 for an 
example of a 'symmetric' t rans lat ion system). 
Whereas early MT systems blended the rules 
of grammar and the analysis procedure for 
ef f ic iency reasons, it has also become 
customary, given current system opt imizat ion 
techniques, to make a clear separat ion between 
programming logic and data on the one hand, 
and l inguist ic  logic and data on the other. 
This separat ion is convenient  for the div is ion 
of labour between the l inguist and the 
programmer, and it enables the former to 
revise and complete his rule systems without 
the latter  hav ing to constant ly  change his 
programs. 
The METAL automatic  t rans lat ion system tries 
to be mult i l ingual  in the above sense. More- 
over, it makes an attempt at separat ing soft- 
ware and l ingware (= l inguist ic  knowledge 
wr i t ten in a specia l ised user  language). In 
the following, I wil l  show how the adopt ion of 
a new k ind of va lency framework, developed at 
the K.U.Leuven in the course of the last two 
years, enhances the mul t i l ingua l i ty  and 
modular i ty  even further. For the sake of 
clarity, I wi l l  f irst review the relevant 
aspects of the va lency framework in the 
current METAL system. 
I. Va lency  in the METAL system 
Since the main c la im to be advanced in this 
paper bears on the relat ion between a valency 
framework and the general  design of an MT 
system, I wil l  f irst say a few words on the 
METAL system architecture.  I wil l  then review 
and comment upon the va lency framework in this 
system. 
i.I. The METAL arch i tecturo 
In METAL the t rans lat ion process proceeds in 
three phases. Dur ing the analysis phase an 
input sentence is mapped onto one or more 
interpretat ions.  Each interpretat ion is 
represented as a f lattened phrase structure, 
cons ist ing of a predicate node fo l lowed by one 
or more arguments (and zero or more 
modif iers).  Anaphor ic  l inks are resolved 
dur ing the integration phase. The result ing 
analysis trees are not intended to be 
language- independent  representat ions,  but are 
passed to a b i l ingual  transfer phase. During 
transfer, analysis trees are structura l ly  and 
lexical ly modi f ied  according to TL 
specif icat ions. The output sentence is the 
str ing of terminal nodes of this t ransformed 
tree.

The METAL  sys tem accommodates  two k inds  of 
t rans fer /generat ion  approaches .  Most  t rans fer  
ins t ruct ions  are pa i red  one- to -one  w i th  the 
grammar  ru les  used  to per fo rm the SL ana lys is .  
However ,  p rov is ions  have a lso been  made to 
complement  th is  "d i rect  t ransfer '  approach  
w i th  an independent  t rans fer  g rammar  (see 
Root, 1985).  The la t te r  approach  is becoming  
more  and  more  impor tant  in METAL  because  it 
g reat ly  enhances  the modu lar i ty  of the sys tem 
(viz. w i th  an eye on us ing  it for  severa l  
d i f fe rent  language pa i rs ) .  
1.2o The valency framework 
It is we l l -known that  the dependency  re la t ions  
between a verb  and i ts  a rguments  can in f luence  
great ly  the lex ica l  and  s t ruc tura l  t rans fer  of 
both, as we l l  as the s t ruc tura l  t rans fer  of 
the c lause  as a whole .  Though the dependency  
re la t ions  themse lves  may be language-  
independent ,  the i r  encod ing  var ies  f rom one 
language to another ,  and, w i th in  one language,  
f rom one verb  to another .  It is there fore  
essent ia l  to know for  each  verb  what  its 
dependents  shou ld  look  l ike. This  top ic  
be ing  cent ra l  in Va lency  Grammar,  it is not 
surpr i s ing  that many MT sys tems (e.g. 
TAUM-AVIAT ION,  SUSY, GETA, AR IANA-78 ,  EUROTRA) 
incorporate  va lency  not ions  (see Somers,  
1986).  One essent ia l  not ion  bor rowed f rom 
va lency  theory  is that  of ' va lency  frame',  
i.e. a pat tern  l i s t ing  al l  the complements  
a l lowed and/or  requ i red  by a verb, together  
w i th  assoc ia ted  morpho-syntact i c  and/or  
syntact i c  features .  
S ince  German-Eng l i sh  is the fur thest  
deve loped language pa i r  of  METAL  at present ,  I 
w i l l  now d iscuss  what  the va lency  f rames look 
l ike  for  German.  In the METAL  sys tem the 
German va lency  f rames  main ly  inc lude  
morpho-syntact i c  in fo rmat ion  (syntact ic  
(sub) category  and/or  sur face  case) w i th  
respect  to non-sub jec t  a rguments .  For  
instance,  the pat tern  (A-X (CP TH)) s igna ls  
that  a German verb  car ry ing  it may  take, 
bes ides  a nominat ive  subject,  an accusat ive  
re f lex ive  pronoun (A-X) plus  a complement  
phrase  in t roduced by dass  (CP TH). The 
opt iona l i ty  of a rguments  is not s igna l led  in 
the f rame itsel f ,  but in a separate  feature  on 
the verba l  p red icate .  
In analys is ,  pred icate -argument  s t ructures ,  
resu l t ing  f rom a f la t ten ing  and rear rangement  
of const i tuent  s t ructures ,  are passed  to a 
case f rame processor .  The la t te r  a t tempts  to 
'use up' the ava i lab le  sentence  const i tuents  
by match ing  them aga ins t  the argument  
spec i f i ca t ions  in the va lency  frame(s) 
spec i f ied  for  the  verba l  p red icate .  When it 
f inds a const i tuent  that  matches  an argument  
spec i f i ca t ion  in the frame, it updates  th is  
const i tuent  w i th  a grammat ica l  role (SUBJECT, 
( IN)DIRECT OBJECT,  etc.) accord ing  to some 
genera l  imp l i ca t ion  re la t ion  ho ld ing  between 
grammat ica l  ro les  and case mark ings  (or some 
other  sort  of  cod ing) .  For  a c lause  to be 
we l l - fo rmed,  at least  one of  i ts  verb 's  f rames 
must  have  a ' f i l ler"  for  each  of  its a rgument  
's lots ' .  I f  a f rame is found to be app l i cab le  
in more  than one way, p re ference  is g iven  to 
one app l i ca t ion  on the  bas is  of word  order  
c r i te r ia  and/or  semant ic  p roper t ies  of the 
subject  argument .  Eventua l ly ,  the case f rame 
processor  re turns  e i ther  an ana lys i s  t ree  that  
has been  updated  w i th  grammat ica l  ro le 
in format ion ,  or it d i scards  the input  
sentence.  
Dur ing  the t rans fer  phase,  morpho-syntact i c  
in fo rmat ion  of  the sort  p resent  in va lency  
f rames may be used, both  in tes ts  and in 
t rans format ions  assoc ia ted  w i th  lex ica l  
t rans fer  entr ies ,  to a t tune  SL argument  
spec i f i ca t ions  to the TL. In addi t ion,  
t rans fer  ent r ies  may conta in  fur ther  
semant ico -syntact i c  res t r i c t ions  on argument  
pos i t ions ,  wh ich  may he lp  in choos ing  the 
r ight t rans la t ion  for  a verb.  The grammat ica l  
ro les  are used  to conver t  the canon ica l  
o rder ing  of  the t rans la t ions  of the verb  and 
its a rguments  into  the appropr ia te  TL 
order ing,  as we l l  as to generate  the 
appropr ia te  forms of  the TL const i tuents .  
1.3. D iscuss ion  
Before  d i scuss ing  the new, extended va lency  
f ramework,  we wi l l  b r ie f ly  po int  out how the 
ex is t ing  sys tem does  not yet exp lo i t  the 
potent ia l  of a va lency  grammar  to the full. 
The on ly  va lency  f rames  re fer red  to by the 
case f raming  package  in the course  of 
t rans la t ion  are SL va lency  frames.  There  is no 
procedure  for mapp ing  SL f rames onto TL 
frames, and  the in fo rmat ion  prov ided  in TL 
f rames is not used  when TL s t r ings  are 
generated .  The under ly ing  assumpt ion  seems to 
be that  a rgument  s t ruc tures  are more  or  less  
the same across  languages .  Any d isc repanc ies  
w i th  respect  to the argument  s t ruc ture  are 
reso lved  by means  of  a smal l  set of 
t rans format ions  spec i f ied  in the re levant  
lex ica l  t rans fer  ent r ies .  Any  d i sc repanc ies  
w i th  respect  to the express ion  of the argument  
s t ruc ture  (e.g case-marked  vs. unmarked  NPs) 
are hand led  in the re levant  grammar  rules. 
The assumpt ion  that  a rgument  s t ruc tures  are 
more  or less the same across  languages  is a lso  
re f lec ted  in the s ta tus  of the canon ica l  
c lause  representat ions  employed  in the 
METAL  system. The la t te r  are cons idered  to 
be some sort of in ter l ingua l  s t ruc tures  f rom 
wh ich  TL sur face  s t r ings  are to be generated  
d i rec t ly  (cf. the d i rec t  t rans fer  approach) .  
However,  the genera l  ph i losophy  in the 
METAL  sys tem has been to start  off  w i th  a 
ra ther  'shal low'  level  of analys is ,  rather  
than a 'deep representat ion '  of some sort  (see 
\ [SLOCUM 83\]). Thus, there  seems to be a 
conf l i c t  between the re luc tance  to work  wi th  a 
more  semant ica l ly  o r iented  ana lys i s  and the 
des i re  to have an in ter l ingua .  Th is  conf l i c t  
may have  been neg l ig ib le  for the 
German-Eng l i sh  system, because  these  languages  
are 'cut' a long  very  s imi la r  pat terns .  
Never the less ,  even these  two languages  d i sp lay  
subt le  d i f fe rences  as to the way they 'model'  
169 
ext ra l ingu is t i c  rea l i ty .  For  instance,  
'he lp ing'  is a rea l -wor ld  re la t ionsh ip  
invo lv ing  two ent i t ies ,  A and B. In Engl ish,  
th is  re la t ionsh ip  is const rued  as an ac t ion  of 
A wh ich  a f fec ts  B (A he lps  B is s imi la r  to A 
h i ts  B); in German,  it is mode l led  as i f  A 
t rans fer red  someth ing  to B (A \[nom\] h i l f t  B 
\[dat\] is s imi la r  to A \[nom\] gibt  B \[dat\] C 
\[acc\]).  S imi la r  d i f fe rences  may be expected  to 
inc rease  as languages  more  d ivergent  than 
Eng l i sh  and German are  to be hand led .  If, for 
some reason  or  other,  it is not  feas ib le  or  
des i rab le  to reduce  language-spec i f i c  mode ls  
of some rea l -wor ld  re la t ionsh ip  to a language-  
independent  case  frame, there  is noth ing  but 
to s ta te  t rans la t ion  equ iva lences  between 
c lause  s t ruc tures  in te rms of  equ iva lences  
between l anguage-dependent  argument  
s t ruc tures .  (For s imi la r  v iews,  see Alam, 
1986; Kudo  and  Nomura,  1986; Van  der  Korst ,  
1987.) 
A l though there  is l i t t le  doubt  that  the 
f raming  fac i l i t i es  p rov ided  in the  sys tem work  
qu i te  wel l  and y ie ld  very  good  resu l t s  for 
t rans la t ions  f rom German in to  Eng l i sh ,  we have  
t r ied  to improve  the f raming  modu le  beyond 
th is  language-pa i r .  One  shou ld  a lso bear  in 
mind  that, w i th  a less  we l l - s t ruc tured  MT 
sys tem than  METAL,  we cou ld  never  have  
deve loped a more  language- independent  va lency  
mechan ism in such an easy  and  s t ra ight fo rward  
way. 
2+ An a l te rnat ive  va lency  f zamawozk  
2 .1 .  The  arch i tec tuze  
The genera l  ph i losophy  beh ind  the  deve lopment  
of the Leuven va lency  f ramework  has  been  to 
mainta in  an essent ia l l y  syntax -dr iven  MT 
system, wh i le  enhanc ing  the la t te r ' s  
modu lar i ty  in v iew of extens ions  to o ther  
language pai rs .  Th is  requ i red  recons ider ing  
not on ly  the  re la t ion  between l ingware  and 
sof tware ,  but  a lso  the  genera l  a rch i tec ture  
beh ind  the system.  
Wi th  respect  to the genera l  t rans la t ion  theory  
beh ind  the METAL  system, enhanc ing  the 
modu lar i ty  bo i l s  down to inc reas ing  the 
re la t ive  independence  of  the  analys is ,  
t rans fer ,  and  synthes is  modu les .  More  
spec i f i ca l l y ,  we assume that  
(a) an ana lys i s  modu le  must  p rov ide  
representat ions  wh ich  are usefu l  
s ta r t ing -po in ts  for  t rans la t ion  into 
mul t ip le  TLs; 
(b) ma jor  par ts  of  a synthes is  modu le  must  be 
independent  of the SL under  cons iderat ion  
so that  they  can a lso be used  for 
t rans la t ion  f rom other  SLs; 
(c) mapp ings  between SL and  TL representat ions  
must  be de f ined  in te rms of a min imum of, 
p re ferab ly ,  lex ica l ly  governed  t rans for -  
mat ions .  
Though we are st i l l  far  away f rom the ideal  
t rans fer -based  MT system, we be l ieve  that  the 
a l te rnat ive  va lency  f ramework  may be an 
impor tant  s tep  in the r ight  d i rec t ion .  
2.2 .  The  l ingu is t i c  fundamenta ls  o f  the  
a l te rnat ive  va lency  f ramework  
The bas ic  assumpt ion  is that  s imp le  c lauses  
have  a pred icat iona l  s t ruc ture  and  that  
(partial) equ iva lences  between SL and  TL 
c lauses  can be de f ined  in te rms of  (partial) 
equ iva lences  between SL and  TL  pred icat ions .  
The s t ruc tura l  cent re  of  a p red icat ion  is a 
lex ica l  p red icate  w i th  wh ich  one or  more  
va lency  f rames  are assoc ia ted .  Each  va lency  
f rame is a sequence  of typed  argument  s lots  to 
be f i l l ed  w i th  appropr ia te  terms, i.e. 
sentence  const i tuents  of the appropr ia te  
types.  Sentence  const i tuents  wh ich  cannot  be 
re la ted  to any of a p red icate ' s  a rgument  s lots  
shou ld  be ' lega l  sate l l i tes ' ,  i .e. lega l  
c i rcumstant ia l  mod i f ie rs ,  of  the  pred icat ion  
as a whole .  
The s t ruc ture  of  va lency  f rames  is language-  
independent ,  and  can  be de f ined  as fo l lows:  
<frame> : :- " ( "  <slot>+ \[ "OPT" <slot>+\] ") = 
<slot> ::-- "(" <slot_label> <key>+ ")" 
<slot label> ::- one of a set of user-definable atoms, 
startinq with a "S'-sign 
<key> ::- <codepo in ter> I <feature-value-pair> 
<code_/3ointer> ::- one of a set of user-definable atoms 
<feature-value-pair> ::_ .(m <featname> <feat_val>+ ")" 
<feat_name> ::- one of a set of user-definable atoms 
<feat val> : :- one of a set of user-definable atoms 
The number  of a rgument  s lo ts  for  a g iven  
f rame is p r imar i l y  determined  on the  bas is  of 
formal,  l anguage-spec i f i c  c r i te r ia .  Thus 
tes ts  to d i s t ingu ish  behween arguments  (args) 
and sate l l i tes  (sats) inc lude,  bes ides  the 
e l iminat ion  test,  paraphrase  tes ts  (cf. the do 
so and und zwar  tests,  for  Eng l i sh  and German, 
respect ive ly ) ,  as wel l  as d i s t r ibut iona l  and 
subst i tu t iona l  c r i te r ia  (e.g. sats  are f reer  
to move than args, whereas  e lements  of 
p ronomina l  parad igms subst i tu te  more  eas i ly  
for  args  than  for sats).  Whenever  those  tes ts  
are not dec is ive  w i th  respect  to the s ta tus  of 
a sentence  const i tuent ,  the la t te r  is assumed 
to be an arg, since, for  t ransfer ,  it is 
a rguab le  that  it is eas ie r  to operate  on args 
than on sats. 
Argument  s lo ts  may be ob l igatory  or  
opt iona l .  Opt iona l  slots, wh ich  need not be 
present ,  but  are a lways  semant ica l ly  impl ied,  
are set apart  f rom ob l igatory  ones by means  of 
the symbol  OPT. In fact, OPT  is a means  to 
co l lapse  f rames  whose  ob l igatory  s lo ts  are 
ident ica l  and whose  opt iona l  s lots  are not 
mutua l ly  exc lus ive .  Thus, a f rame conta in ing  
n opt iona l  s lo ts  is an abbrev ia t ion  for 2expn 
d i f fe rent  frames. 
Argument  s lots  are  not  in themse lves  
labe l led  semant ica l ly ,  though they  do t ie up 
w i th  semant ic  re la t ions  (deep cases) as all  
va lency  re la t ions  are u l t imate ly  semant ica l ly  
mot ivated .  (See He lb ig  and  Schenke l  (1973) for  
a d i scuss ion  of  the re la t ion  between logical ,  
semant ic ,  and syntact i c  va lency . )  Instead,  a 
s lot  label  is taken  to s igna l  that  cer ta in  
ru les  or regu lar i t ies  app ly  to al l  the args 
car ry ing  that  label .  Our  bas ic  p r inc ip les  for 
labe l l ing  s lots  are the fo l lowing:  
170 
(a) Args  labe l led  $0 are 'deep  sub jects ' ;  
typ ica l  sur face  re f lexes  in Dutch  and 
F rench  are "nominative case',  pos i t ion  to 
the left  of the f in i te  verb  in unmarked  
dec la ra t ives ,  ab i l i ty  to become the 
aqent ive  phrase  in pass ives  (under cer ta in  
cond i t ions ) ;  
(b) Args  labe l led  $I are 'deep ob jects ' ;  
typ ica l  sur face  re f lexes  in Dutch  and 
F rench  are "accusative case',  pos i t ion  
s t rong ly  t ied  to the main  verb, ab i l i ty  to 
become the ' sur face  subject '  in pass ives  
(under cer ta in  cond i t ions ) ;  
(c) Args  labe l led  $2 are ' ind i rec t  ob jects ' ;  
typ ica l  sur face  re f lexes  in Dutch  and 
F rench  are ind i rec t  ob ject  p repos i t ions  
(aan vs? a), a l te rnat ion  between PP\[aan 
vs. a\] and NP\ [non-c l i t i ca l  and lex ica l  vs. 
c l i t i ca l  and pronomina l \ ] ;  
(d) Args  labe l led  $3 are  'ob l ique  ob jects ' ;  a 
typ ica l  sur face  re f lex  in Dutch  and  F rench  
is that  these  args  can be rep laced  by 
adverb ia l  const ruct ions ;  
(e) Args  labe l led  $4 are "prepos i t iona l

args  are PPs, w i th  s t rong ly  governed,  
id iosyncrat i c  p repos i t ions ;  
(f) A rqs  labe l led  $5 are "sub jec t ive

the sub jec t  w i th  b iva lent  verbs  (e.g? 
zi jn/etre 'be');  
(g) Args  labe l led  $6 are "ob jec t ive  
complements ' ;  these  args  are a t t r ibutes  of 
the d i rec t  ob ject  w i th  t r iva lent  verbs  
(e.g. noemen/appeler  'ca l l ' ) .  
It is impor tant  to note  that  those  pr inc ip les  
are ru les  of  thumb, ra ther  than c lear -cut  
de f in i t ions  in terms of  necessary  and 
su f f i c ient  cond i t ions .  However,  far f rom be ing  
arb i t rary ,  the inventory  of  arg labe ls  shou ld  
be jus t i f ied  both  language- in terna l ly  and 
c ross - l ingu is t i ca l ly .  Language-internal ly, 
th is  means  that one has to come up  w i th  a 
number  of  ind icat ions  that  a g iven  arg  label  
a l lows  for  s ign i f i cant  language-spec i f i c  
genera l i za t ions .  Cross-l inguistical ly,  th is  
means  that, in ass ign ing  the same label  to 
s lots  in d i f fe rent  languages,  it must  be 
poss ib le  to reveal  a reasonab le  degree  of  
over lap  in the behav iour  of  f i l l e rs  for the 
s lots  in the respect ive  languages .  Of  course,  
we do not p re tend  that  our l ist  of  a rg  labe ls  
is in any way  exhaust ive  and we grant  that it 
may  have  to be ad jus ted  in the l ight  of  
fu r ther  research.  
Apar t  f rom a slot label,  an argument  s lot  
conta ins  a number  of  'keys' wh ich  re fer  to 
procedures ,  f rame tes ts  and f rame 
const ructors ,  to be ca l led  dur ing  ana lys i s  and 
synthesis ,  respect ive ly .  
Frame tests cons is t  of morpho-syntact i c  and, 
poss ib ly ,  semant ic  cond i t ions  wh ich  
const i tuents  must  sa t i s fy  in order  to become 
potent ia l  s lot  f i l lers .  The actua l  contents  of 
the morpho-syntact i c  const ra in ts  is 
co -determined  by such parameters  as the s lot

Regard ing  the use  of  semant ic  se lec t ion  
res t r i c t ions ,  a fa i r l y  p ragmat ic  course  has 
been  pursued.  That  is, we s tar ted  of f  w i th  
a ra ther  l im i ted  inventory  of semant ic  
features  (\[~ person(a l i zed) \ ] ,  \[~ abstract \ ] ,  
etc.) wh ich  we th ink  to be cons is tent ly  
app l i cab le  and  f lex ib le  enough to be extended 
and/or  changed when the  need ar ises .  Apar t  
f rom semant ic  se lec t ion  res t r i c t ions  on f i l l e r  
const i tuents ,  it is poss ib le  to inc lude  
(canonical)  lex ica l  forms in a s lot  
spec i f i ca t ion  l ist.  These  may re fer  to the 
form requ i red  in e i ther  the ' re lator '  (e.g. 
the prepos i t ion  in a PP or  the con junct ion  in 
a subord inate  c lause) or  the 'head' of  f i l le r  
const i tuents .  The la t te r  funct iona l i ty  has  
been  prov ided  in o rder  to hand le  more  or less 
id iomat ic  NPs (e.g. een keuze in een keuze 
doen, "make a choice' )  wh ich  are st i l l  
sens i t i ve  to regu lar  syntact i c  operat ions  
(e.g. pass iv i za t ion) .  
Frame constructors cons is t  of ins t ruct ions  
accord ing  to wh ich  the sys tem shou ld  generate  
the appropr ia te  sur face  fo rm requ i red  for 
f i l l e rs  of  the s lots  f rom wh ich  those  
const ructors  are ca l led.  Again,  the actua l  
content  of  the ins t ruct ions  is co -determined  
by such parameters  as the  s lot  label  and the 
c lause 's  Mood and Vo ice  values,  as wel l  as by 
lex ica l  in fo rmat ion  prov ided  in the slot.  
It is impor tant  to note  two th ings.  First ,  
it is ac tua l ly  the  same codes  that  are used  
for both  tes ts  (Analysis) and const ructors  
(Synthesis) .  The sys tem knows f rom the 
t rans la t ion  phase  whether  it has  to in terpret  
the code as a test  or as a const ructor .  
Second, both  f rame tes ts  and f rame 
const ructors  are s tored  in separate  f i les, in 
order  to enhance  the modu lar i ty  of the 
l ingware.  However ,  they  are wr i t ten  in the 
same format  as o rd inary  grammar  rules, and a 
spec ia l  in ter face  for loading,  inspect ing  and 
ed i t ing  these  procedures  has  been  deve loped,  
so that they can be easi ly accessed and 
updated by the linguist. 
As an i l lus t ra t ion  of  the above, let us 
cons ider  the fo l low ing  ( incomplete) l ist  of 
va lency  f rames wh ich  occur  as e lements  in a 
va lue  l i s t  to the feature  ARGS for the verb  
faire:

OPT ($2 N1 P1 (PREP pour))) :'make" 
(($0 NI)($5 A)) :'look" 
(($0 NI)($3 MEA)) :'do" 
) 
What  is sa id  here is that  faire can show up in 
(at least) th ree  d i f fe rent  frames. The f i rst  
one conta ins  two necessary  and one opt iona l  
slot. The f i rst  s lot  requ i res  a nomina l  f i l ler

the second one a nomina l  f i l l e r  w i th  se lec t ion  
res t r i c t ion  \ [ -personal \ ] ,  and the opt iona l  one 
a prepos i t iona l  complement  in t roduced by pour 
and hav ing  se lec t ion  res t r i c t ion  
\ [+persona l ( i zed) \ ] .  The second f rame conta ins  
two ob l igatory  slots, the f i rst  of wh ich  
requ i r ing  a nomina l  f i l l e r  and  the second one 
an ad jec t iva l  complement .  F ina l ly ,  the th i rd  
f rame requ i res  a nomina l  f i l l e r  and  a measure  
const i tuent .  The respect ive  f rames are 
i l l us t ra ted  in the fo l low ing  sentences:  
171 
(1) Je ($0) fais ce Jouet  ($I) pour  mon ami ($2) 
"I make this toy for my friend" 
(2) El la  ($0) fair v ie i l le  ($5) 
"She looks old" 
(3) Carte vo l ture  ($0} fair 100 km/h ($3)

An  example  of  a (French)  f rame tes t  is g iven

2 .3 .1 .  Dur ing  ana lys i s ,  the  va lency  
procedure  is invoked f rom wi th in  grammar  ru les  
for  bu i ld ing  c lausa l  s t ruc tures  of  the  
fo l low ing  fo rmat :  
<clausal category> 
ARGI PRED ARG2 .'.. ARGn 
<ARGS> 
Given  a verb  w i th  a set  o f  va lency  f rames  and  
a set  o f  sentence  const i tuents ,  th i s  p rocedure  
has  to  make sure  that  one  o f  these  f rames  is 
rea l i zed  in  the  sentence  at i ssue ,  and, if  so, 
171 
it has  to make c lear  how that  f rame is 
rea l i zed .  It w i l l  take  a f rame to be rea l i zed  
in a tree, i f  and  on ly  if each  of the  f rame's  
non-opt iona l  s lots,  and  poss ib ly ,  one or more  
of its opt iona l  s lots,  is matched by at least  
one sentence  const i tuent .  I f  the sys tem 
f inds a match ing  frame, it w i l l  u l t imate ly  
re turn  a t ree  s t ruc ture  in wh ich  each  of  the 
va lency-bound const i tuents  is marked  for a 
s lot  and  whose  root  node  conta ins  a re ference  
to the match ing  frame. 
Now, the genera l  idea  is to have the 
procedure  look  for  the  most  ambi t ious  f rame 
match ing  the t ree  s t ructure ,  as we l l  as for 
the best  rea l i za t ion  of th is  f rame in the 
st ructure,  wh i le  avo id ing  super f luous  
process ing  as much as poss ib le .  This  imp l ies  
that  two k inds  of p re ference  mechan isms had  to 
be in t roduced in the va lency  procedure :  one 
to choose  the  best  cand idate  f rom a set of  
potent ia l  f i l l e rs  for  a g iven  s lot  ( instead of  
a lways  choos ing  the  f i rst  const i tuent  match ing  
the spec i f i ca t ions  of that  slot), and one to 
choose  the most  ambi t ious  f rame f rom a set of  
success fu l  f rames  ( instead of  a lways  choos ing  
the f i rst  f rame that  matches  a g iven  ana lys i s  
tree).  
The f i rst  p re ference  mechan ism is 
imp lemented  in the fo l low ing  way. When 
check ing  whether  a f rame matches  the tree, the 
va lency  procedure  co l lec ts  for each  slot  ($i 
key l . . . keyN)  all sentence  const i tuents  wh ich  
pass  al l  the f rame tes ts  assoc ia ted  w i th  the 
keys  in that  slot. Fur thermore ,  in the ac t ion  
part  of  f rame tests,  each  potent ia l  f i l l e r  
gets  a number  ind icat ing  the probab i l i ty  that  
th is  const i tuent  wi l l  be taken  as the u l t imate  
f i l l e r  for a slot. As  the l ingu is t  can eas i ly  
a l te r  th is  number,  he has  s ign i f i cant  cont ro l  
over  the ass ignment  of  const i tuents  to slots.  
The actua l  ass ignment  procedure  is fa i r ly  
economica l  and  runs as fo l lows.  Whenever  
there  is on ly  one potent ia l  f i l l e r  for  a s lot  
(which may be e i ther  an ob l igatory  or  an 
opt iona l  one), th is  const i tuent  loses its 
mark ing  as a cand idate  f i l l e r  for o ther  slots, 
if it was  one. Fur thermore ,  it is marked  as 
the on ly  remain ing  f i l l e r  for  the s lot  that  is 
be ing  matched.  A s ide -e f fec t  of th is  
mark ing  may be that  one of the other  s lots  
w i l l  now have  on ly  one cand idate  f i l ler .  In 
that  case, the la t te r  const i tuent  wi l l  be 
marked  as the actua l  f i l l e r  for that  slot and 
lose i ts  mark ing  as a potent ia l  f i l le r  for 
st i l l  o ther  slots, if it was  one. Th is  may 
again  cause the number  of potent ia l  f i l l e rs  
for  yet  another  s lot  to be reduced to one, in 
wh ich  case the above mark ing  (and unmark ing)  
p rocedure  s tar ts  over  again.  If, eventua l ly ,  
there  is more  than  one potent ia l  f i l l e r  for  a 
slot, the procedure  takes  the le f tmost  
cand idate  wh ich  rece ived  the h ighest  p re fer -  
ence va lue  for the s lot  in the f rame tests .  
The second pre ference  mechan ism is fa i r ly  
economica l  as wel l .  The genera l  assumpt ion  is 
that, in o rder  to f ind  the most  'ambit ious '  
frame, one shou ld  look for the f rame wh ich  has 
the largest  number  of s lots  real ized.  In 
order  to avo id  super f luous  process ing ,  we let 
the more  complex  f rames (i.e. the ones w i th  
the la rger  number  of slots, whether  ob l igatory  
or opt ional )  p recede  the less  complex  ones in 
the ARGS va lue  of a verb.  Consequent ly ,  the 
sys tem comes across  the fo rmer  be fore  it sees 
the lat ter .  Whenever  two or  more  a l te rnat ive  
f rames happen to have  the same number  of 
slots, the lex icographer  has  to determine  
(e.g., on the  bas is  of f requency  of 
occur rence)  wh ich  f rame to t ry  f i rst .  G iven  
that  the sys tem has  found a match ing  frame, it 
w i l l  on ly  exp lore  an a l te rnat ive  f rame if  the 
number  of (opt ional  and  non-opt iona l )  s lots  
conta ined  in the  a l te rnat ive  f rame outnumbers  
the number  of  s lo ts  found to be rea l i zed  
dur ing  the match ing  of the  f i rst  frame. An 
a l te rnat ive  f rame wi l l  be  pre fer red  on ly  when 
it has  more  s lots  rea l i zed  than  the prev ious  
match ing  frame. 
2.3 .2 .  Dur ing  t ransfer ,  s ince we take  
argument  s t ruc tures  to be language-spec i f i c  
ent i t ies ,  the va lency  procedure  has to 
accompl i sh  two tasks.  F i rst ,  it has to 
determine  wh ich  TL  f rame cor responds  w i th  the 
SL f rame that  has been  found to be app l i cab le  
to the ana lys i s  tree.  Secondly ,  it has to 
spec i fy  wh ich  s lots  in the TL f rame cor respond 
w i th  wh ich  s lo ts  in the SL  frame. It per fo rms 
those  tasks  in the fo l low ing  way. 
F irst ,  the mechan ism looks  up al l  the 
t rans fers  for the SL  verba l  p red icate .  Each 
of the  verba l  t rans fer  ent r ies  descr ibes  a 
t rans i t ion  between the SL verb  w i th  one of its 
frames, and an equ iva lent  TL verb  wi th  one of 
its f rames.  It does so in te rms of (a) condi -  
t ions  on the t rans i t ion  and  (b) (poss ib ly  
part ia l )  mappings  between SL s lots  and TL 
slots.  The cond i t ion  par t  of a verba l  t rans fer  
ent ry  may be empty  or  take  any of the fo l low-  
ing forms, for  d i sambiguat ion  w.r . t ,  the TL: 
(a) a test  on the presence  (absence) of some 
slot f i l l e r  in (from) the SL tree; 
(b) a test  on the presence  (absence) of 
cer ta in  lex ica l  or g rammat ica l  in fo rmat ion  
on some s lot  f i l l e r  in (from) the SL tree; 
(c) a test  on the presence  (absence) of some 
feature  on (from) the root  node of the SL 
tree. 
As for the mapp ings  between SL s lots  and TL 
slots, three  poss ib i l i t i es  have been catered  
for so far: 
(a) SL s lot  maps  onto  TL s lot.  In th is  case, 
we only  s tate  cont ras t ive  in fo rmat ion  
wh ich  is s t r i c t ly  necessary  to e f fect  an 
appropr ia te  mapp ing  between SL s lots  and 
TL slots.  That  is, in General ,  
equ iva lences  between d is t inc t  slot labe ls  
wi l l  suf f ice,  though add i t iona l  
in fo rmat ion  may be prov ided  for 
d i sambiguat ion .  
(b) SL s lot  w i thout  TL counterpar t .  Again, 
on ly  min ima l  in fo rmat ion  needs  to be 
spec i f ied  in order  to ident i fy  the SL slot 
whose  f i l l e r  must  be removed f rom the t ree 
st ructure.  
(c) TL s lot  w i thout  SL counterpar t .  Here, the 
coder  shou ld  be able  to descr ibe  the 
in terna l  s t ruc ture  of a TL const i tuent  to 
be c reated  at c lause  level  in the t ree 
st ructure.  At  the moment,  the 
funct iona l i ty  p rov ided  is l im i ted  to the 
c reat ion  of new TL nodes  w i thout  in terna l  
s t ructure .  
173 
Hav ing  re t r ieved  al l  the  t rans fers  for the 
SL verb, the sys tem reduces  the potent ia l  
t rans fer  ambigu i ty  o f  a SL  verb  in two steps. 
It f i rst  d i scards  any t rans fers  for wh ich  not 
al l  cond i t ions  are  fu l f i l l ed .  A f te rwards ,  it 
checks  wh ich  of the remain ing  t rans fer  ent r ies  
(there shou ld  be at least  one) p rov ides  a 
f rame equ iva lence  whose  ' le f t -hand side" can 
be l inked  to the  f rame rea l i zed  in the  SL 
tree. Once th is  equ iva lence  has  been  found, 
the  TL  f rame matched by  the  ' r ight -hand side' 
of the f rame equ iva lence  wi l l  be  subst i tu ted  
for the  SL f rame re ferenced  by a feature  on 
the root  node  of  the  tree. At  th i s  stage, 
nodes  can be pruned f rom or added to the t ree  
s t ructure ,  i f  l ex ica l  ins t ruct ions  te l l  the 
sys tem to do so. 
F ina l ly ,  a f te r  t rans la t ion  of  the verba l  
p red icate ,  the  sys tem exp lo i t s  the 
equ iva lences  between SL s lo ts  and  TL  s lots  in 
o rder  to determine  how the t rans la t ions  of  the 
sentence- leve l  const i tuents  fit into  the s lots  
of  the TL  frame. 
The above  match ing  procedure  compl ica tes  the 
lex icographer ' s  task  cons iderab ly  (see sect ion  
3. for how we t ry  to remedy th i s  s i tuat ion) .  
Th is  is because  it requ i res  that  verba l  
t rans fer  ent r ies  be wr i t ten  in such a way  that  
each  of  them prov ides  
(a) a l ink  w i th  a SL verb  and exact ly  one of 
i ts  f rames;  
(b) a l ink  w i th  a TL verb  and exact ly  one of 
i ts  f rames;  
(c) su f f i c ient  in fo rmat ion  concern ing  the s lot  
equ iva lences  ho ld ing  between these  two 
f rames.  
On the o ther  hand, it has  the  advantage  of  
g iv ing  the d ic t ionary  wr i te r  s ign i f i cant  
cont ro l  over  verba l  and  c lausa l  t rans fer .  
2.3.3.  The task  of  the  va lency  procedure  
dur ing  synthesis, as we conce ived  of it, 
cons is ts  in gu id ing  the generat ion  of the 
appropr ia te  sur face  form of va lency-bound 
sentence  const i tuents .  Fur thermore ,  the 
synthes is  component  conta ins  const i tuent  
o rder ing  procedures  wh ich  may re fer  to s lot  
labe ls  in o rder  to rear range  the canon ica l  
c lause  s t ruc ture  in to  the  appropr ia te  TL 
order ing .  
F irst ,  the  va lency  procedure  re t r ieves  the 
TL - f rame f rom the root of the  tree. For  each  
slot  conta ined  in th is  frame, it then checks  
whether  it conta ins  any lex ica l  in fo rmat ion  
spec i f i c  to the TL verb  and  the f rame that  are 
at i ssue  (e.g., the th i rd  (optional)  slot in 
the f i rst  f rame of  faire has  to be f i l l ed  by a 
prepos i t iona l  phrase  in t roduced by pour) and 
makes  th is  in fo rmat ion  ava i lab le  for  fu r ther  
p rocess ing .  Next, it ca l l s  al l  of the  f rame 
const ructors  assoc ia ted  w i th  the keys  in the 
slot. Dur ing  those  ca l l s  the re levant  
sentence  const i tuents  wi l l  be mod i f ied  and 
updated  accord ing  to the ins t ruct ions  that  the 
l ingu is t  spec i f ied  in the const ructors .  
Eventua l ly ,  the va lency  procedure  shou ld  
re turn  a t ree  al l  of whose  va lency-bound 
const i tuents  conta in  su f f i c ient  in fo rmat ion  so 
that  morphological  ru les  and l inear i za t ion  
ru les  can generate  the  appropr ia te  TL forms 
and const i tuent  o rder ing  (the la t te r  ru les  may 
occas iona l ly  a l te r  the const i tuents '  forms).  
Again,  the l ingu is t  has  s ign i f i cant  cont ro l  
over  the generat ion  process  as he can eas i ly  
spec i fy  and  update  the contents  of  both  f rame 
const ructors  and  l inear i za t ion  ru les.  
3. Rem.z l te  ~"*d Prob l~ 
In the  last  year, the  a l te rnat ive  va lency  
f ramework  presented  in th is  paper  has  been  
app l ied  to the t rans la t ion  of  Dutch  into  
French,  and  v ice  versa .  Though the  app l i ca t ion  
has  been  l im i ted  to "kerne l "  sentences ,  i .e. 
s imp le  ac t ive  and  pass ive  dec la ra t ive  
sentences  (poss ib ly  conta in ing  re la t ive

are be ing  made to hand le  non- f in i te

In the meant ime,  smal l  convers ion

and German-Span ish  (at CDS Barce lona) .  These  
exper iments  have  shown that, at least  for  the

(c) its methodo log ica l  underp inn ing  to a

Because  of  these  advantages ,  the Leuven 
va lency  f ramework  has  recent ly  been  adopted  by 
all s i tes  of the  METAL  pro jec t .  
However ,  ser ious  prob lems remain  to be 
tack led,  w i th  respect  to both  lex icon  cod ing  
and grammat ica l  pars ing .  The f i rst  k ind  of 
p rob lems can be t raced  to the  r ig id i ty  of the 
f rame mapp ing  schema i tse l f .  As has  been  
po in ted  out in sect ion  2.3.2. ,  the main  
requ i rement  for  f rame mapp ing  to be poss ib le  
is that  verb  lex icons  be coded cons is tent ly  
across  languages .  Th is  may indeed be 
pro f i tab le  in an exper imenta l  env i ronment .  
However ,  it is doubt fu l  whether  we can expect  
the average  end  user  to have  both  source, 
target,  and  t rans fer  cod ings  in mind  at the 
same t ime and to make sure that  no aspect  of 
the mapp ing  between f rames  is over looked .  
There fore ,  we have  deve loped prov is iona l  
re laxat ions  on the r ig id  schema to the extent  
that  at least  the mandatory  s lots  of the TL 
f rame must  have  a counterpar t  in the SL frame. 
Eventua l ly ,  however ,  it may  turn  out to be 
more  e f fec t ive  not to have  these  re laxat ions  
at run time, but  to sort  out incons is tenc ies  
between verba l  lex icons  at cod ing  t ime.

The second k ind  of p rob lems (among wh ich  the 
notor ious  d i f f i cu l t  p rob lem of PP -a t tachment )  
has  to do w i th  a need  for st i l l  g reater  
funct iona l i ty  in the system. In o rder  to 
prov ide  for th is  funct iona l i ty ,  we env isage  
two paths  of  fu r ther  research .  One path  
concerns  how we can make our  va lency  mechan ism 
in teract  w i th  a mechan ism to ident i fy  
per iphera l  const i tuents ,  wh ich  orb i t  a round 
the verb  and  i ts  a rguments .  The o ther  path  
concerns  the extens ib i l i ty  of  the va lency  
f ramework  to nouns  and ad jec t ives .  
P re l iminary  research  a long  both  l ines  has 
revea led  that  
there  are no ob jec t ions  of  p r inc ip le  aga ins t  
the va lency  f ramework  presented  in th is  paper.
