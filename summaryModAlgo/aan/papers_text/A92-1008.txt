Abstract  
We present a localisation component that sup- 
ports the generation of cross-modal deictic ex- 
pressions in the knowledge-based presentation 
system WIP. We deal with relative localisations 
(e.g., "The object to the left, of object X."), 
absolute localisations (e.g., "The object in the 
upl)er left part of the l)icture.") and corner lo- 
calisations (e.g., "The object in the lower right 
corner of the l)icture"). In addition, we distin- 
guish two localisation granularities, one less de- 
tailed (e.g., "the object to the left. of object X.") 
and one more detailed (e.g., "the object above 
and to the left. of object X."). We consider cor- 
ner localisations to be similar to absolute local- 
isations and in turn absolute localisations to be 
specialisations of relative localisations. This al- 
lows us to compute all three localisation types 
with one generic localisation procedure. As 
elementary localisations are derived from pre- 
viously computed composite localisations, we 
can cope with both localisation granularities 
in a computationally efficient way. Based on 
these l)rimary localisation l)rocedures, we dis- 
cuss how objects can be localised among several 
other objects. Finally we introduce group local- 
isations (e.g., "The object to left, of the group 
of or, her objects.") and show how to deal with 
thern. 
1 In t roduct ion  
The increasing amount of information to be communi- 
cated to users of complex technical systems nowadays 
makes it necessary to find new ways to present infor- 
mation. Neither the variety of all possible l)resentation 
situations can be anticipated nor it is fiLrther adequate 
to present he required information in a single communi- 
cation mode, such as either text or graphics. Therefore, 
the automatic generation of nmltimodal presentations 
tailored to the individual user has become necessary. 
Current research projects in artificial intelligence like 
SAGE (\[Roth et al, 1990\]), FN/ANDD (\[Marks and 
Reiter, 1990\]), COMET (\[Feiner and MeKeown, 1990\]) 
and WIP (\[Wahlster el al., 1991a\]) reflect the growing 
interest in this topic. 
For the knowledge-based presentation system WIP, 
the task is the generation of a multimodal document ac- 
cording to the formal description of the communicative 
intent of the planned presentation and a set of generation 
parameters. The current scenario for WIP is the gener- 
ation of instructions for using an espresso-machine. A 
typical fragment of an instruction manual for an espresso 
machine is shown in figure 1.

Cross-modal deictic expressions, e.g., "the lid" or "the 
knob in the middle," help to establish the coreferentiality 
between the entities mentioned in the text and shown in 
the picture as well (\[Wahlster et al, 1991b\]). The use o! 
spatial relationships uch as "the knob in the middle" 
simplifies the generation of referring expressions that 
have to identify a particular object in a picture. Ob- 
viously these spatial relationships cannot be computed 
in advance because they depend on the projection para- 
meters for the picture, e.g., the viewpoint, which in turn 
themselves depend on the communicative intent of the 
document to be planned 1. 
The localisation component described in this paper 
was developed in order to support the generation ot 
cross-modal deietic referring expressions. All procedures 
are fully implemented and were recently integrated intc 
the first WIP prototype. They are coded in Commor

feasible to compute all possible relative localisations from a 
combinatoric point of view.

Lisp and run under Genera 8.0 on a Maclvory. A testbed 
called LOC-SYS was also developed: it allows the con- 
venient generation and manipulation of rectangle scenes 
like the examples given in this paper. 
Before we describe the methods which underlie the 
various localisation procedures, in the following section 
we present our views about localisation phenomena and 
introduce the terminology used in the rest of this paper. 
2 Object Localisation 
A lot of work has been done on 'object localisation' 
and its linguistic complelnent, 'spatial l)repositions'. 
Wunderlich/Herweg (\[Wunderlich, 1982\], \[Wunderlich 
and Herweg, forthcoming\]) and Herskovits (\[Herskovits, 
1985\]) provide linguistic approaches to the semantics of 
spatial prepositions. NL-systems like NAOS (\[Neumann 
and Novak, 1986\]), HAM-RPM (\[Hahn el al., 1980\]), 
SWYSS (\[HuBmann and Schefe, 1984\]) and C'ITYTOUR 
(\[Andr~ et al, 1985\],\[Andr~ et al, 1986\]) address var- 
ious issues regarding computational aspects. Schirra 
(\[Schirra, to appear 1992\]) and Habel/Pribbenow (\[Ha- 
l)el and Pribbenow, 1988\],\[Pribbenow, 1990\]) also incor- 
porate relevant work from cognitive psychology. 
In our approach, we concentrate on the requirements 
for localising objects ill pictures. We assume that the 
user can see the picture containing the objects to be 
localised and we do not deal with the problem of an- 
ticipating possibly wrong visualisations of the user in 
the case he/she cannot see the picture. We do not deal 
with possible intrinsic orientations of depicted objects 
(c.f. \[Retz-Schlnidt, 1988\]) and assume the deictic refer- 
ence frame of a common viewer (c.f. figure 5). Together 
with every localisation, we compute a so-called applica- 
bility degree from the intervall \[0..1\]. The applicability 
degree is not only used to generate linguistic hedges (c.f. 
\[Lakoff, 1972\]) as in SWYSS or CITYTOUR, but also 
for selecting the 'best' localisation from a set of alter- 
natives. The localisations computed on our system are 
two-dimensional localisations in the sense that they are 
based on the 2D-projection of a picture aim not on its 
possible 3D-representation. In the rest of this section 
we will describe the localisation phenomena we take into 
account and introduce our terminology. 
2.1 Re la t ive  and abso lu te  loeal isat ions 
The objects shown in part A of figure 2 can be localised 
as follows: 
B 
%% jS S I I  
. I 
A? R 
Figure 2: Localising objects in a picture 
(1) "Object A is on the right side of the picture." 
(2) "Object B is ill the lower part of the picture." 
(3) "Object A is to the right of Object B." 
(4) "Object B is below Object A." 
Sentences (1) and (2) are considered to contain ab- 
so lute  localisations: an object is localised by stating 
its absolute position in the picture. Sentences (3) and 
(4) are examples of re la t ive  local isat ions:  an object 
is localised by stating its position relative to another ob- 
ject. The object to be located will be called the pr imary  
ob jec t  (LO for short). The object that serves as refer- 
ence for locating the primary object is called re ference  
ob jec t  (REFO for short). 
How can we explain the similarity between absolute 
and relative localisations, between "on the right side of 
the picture" and "to the right of Object B"? Our hy- 
1)othesis is: 
Absoh'lte localisations are specialisations of 
relative localisations in the sense that for ab- 
solute localisations the center of the picture 
functions as an implicit reference object. 
Part B of figure 2 shows how the absolute localisation 
of part A can be explained as a relative localisation by 
assuming a circle-shaped center: "Object A is on the 
right side of the picure." is equivalent to "Object A is 
to the right of the center of the picture." 
2.2 E lementary  and  composite localisations 
Whereas the unambiguous localisations of the objects in 
figure 2 could be achieved by naming either the horizon- 
tal ("on the right side", "to the right of") or vertical 
relation ("in the lower part", "below"), figure 3 shows a 
situation in which it is necessary to give both the hori- 
zontal and vertical position of the object with respect o 
the reference object:

A, B, 
Figure 3: Elementary and composite localisations 
Ill part A of figure 3, it is sufficient o describe object 
C as the object "to the right of" or "above" object A. 
But in part B, both descriptions would be ambiguous, 
because "to the right of" or "above" could refer to object 
D or B respectively. The only possibility to localise C 
unambiguously is to describe it as being "above and to 
the right" of A. 
Localisations where either the horizontal or vertical 
relation is given will be called e lementary  local isa- 
t ions. If both relations are stated together, we will call 
it a composite localisation. 
The localisation types introduced so far - -  absolute vs. 
relative and elementary vs. composite - -  are orthogonal. 
Therefore, an absolute or a relative localisation can be 
further subcategorized as being all elementary or a corn- 
posite localisation. 
57
(;omposite localisations cannot always he applied, e.g., 
in figure 2 object B cannot be localised as "the object 
in the lower left part of the picture." Criteria for the 
applicability of composite localisations will not he ex- 
alnined further in this paper as this would lead to more 
complex questions, e.g., whether an object can be lo- 
calised at all. A detailed discussion of these prohlems is 
given in \[Wazinski, 1991\]. 
2.3 The  const ruct ion  of  the  hor i zonta l  and  
ver t ica l  re fe rence  f i 'alne 
One important feature of the localisation l)rocedures 
is the division of the horizontal and vertical reference 
frame into three parts. The reason for this are 'center'- 
localisations as shown in figure 4: 
Figure 4: Center localisations 
In all pictures, object A can be localised as tile object 
"in the center of the 1)icture." In order to integrate this 
observation with the elementary vs. composite distinc- 
tion we divided the horizontal and vertical dimension 
into three parts: 'top',  'horizontal center' and 'bottom'  
and 'left', 'vertical center' and 'top'  respectively (c.f. fig- 
ure 5). Under these conditions the 'center'-localisation 
in the left part of figure 4 can be analysed as a com- 
posite ('vertical center','horizontal center')-localisation. 
For the picture in the middle it is an elementary 'verti- 
cal center'-localisation a d for the right one an elemen- 
tary 'horizontal center'-localisation. When transforming 
these different localisations into a surface string they all 
become the same: "in the center of the picture."

a composite localisation is a special part of a composite 
localisation that does not appear at the linguistic level.

2.4 Corner  Loea l i sa t ions  
An additional ocalisation type that can be used to lo- 
calise objects in pictures is the corner  loca l isat ion:  if 
an object is placed in one of the four corner regions of 
the picture it can be localised as, e.g., "the object in the 
left upper corner of the picture." 
Tile difference between absolute composite localisa- 
tions and corner localisations is illustrated in figure 7: 
While object B can be localised as being "in the lower 
right corner of the picture" it is not possible to use a 
corner localisation for A. In that case, only "in the left 
upper part of the picture" could be used. Therefore, we 
consider corner localisations to be more precise than ab- 
solute composite localisations, i.e., the applicability of a 
corner localisation implies the applicability of the cor- 
responding absolute composite localisation but not vice 
versa.

localisations

Figure 5: Horizontal and vertical reference frame 
Figure 6 shows that it, is also useful to adopt the 
this partition scheme for relative localisations: B would 
usually be described as the object "to the right of A" 
and C as the object "above and to the right of A." 
With respect to tile partition scheme a ('right', ' top')-  
localisation can be applied to C and a ('right', 'horizontal 
center')-localisation to B, The former matches exactly 
with the surface string. The latter can be matched with 
3 Bas ic  Loca l i sa t ion  P rocedures  
In this section we present matrix-oriented localisation 
procedures for absolute and relative localisations. As 
mentioned in section 2.2, both the horizontal and ver- 
tical relation of the primary object are given in case of 
a composite localisation. This suggests that composite 
localisations are composed of elementary localisations. 
The procedures presented here, though, behave differ- 
ently: for the sake of efficiency they compute the com- 
posite localisations first and derive the elementary lo- 
calisations from these previously computed localisation 
results.

3.1 Abso lu te  loea l i sat ions  
We approximate the center of the picture with a rect- 
angle whose horizontal and vertical extension is one third 
of the horizontal and vertical extension of the picture. 
Figure 8 shows the construction of the horizontal and 
vertical reference system according to the rectangular 
center region.

A~((left, y-center), LO) = 1/4, 
Ac((X-center, y-center), LO) = 1/2.

Figure 8: Tile construction of tile horizontal and vertical 
reference system 
Before describing the evaluation function for cornpos- 
ite localisations, we give a few definitions: 
? The horizontal reference system is abbreviated by 
XLOC = {left, x-center, right}, the vertical one by 
YLOC ---- {top, y-center, bottom}. Composite locali- 
sations are denoted by CLOC = XLOC ?YLOC. Both 
reference systems together are described with ULOC 
= XLOCI.JYLOC. 
? The constant CENTER denotes the center rectangle 
of a given picture. 
? POLY denotes the set of all polygons that can ap- 
pear in a picture. For given polygons P1 and 
P2 tile associative and commutative operator N, 
("1 : POLY X POLY ~ POLY computes the in- 
tersection polygon. The empty polygon is denoted 
by P0. The following holds: VP E POLY : P$ 71 P = 
pnD~ = P~. 
? The fimction PR (Partial Rectangle), PR : CLOC x 
POLY ~ POLY ,  computes the rectangle correspond- 
ing to a given composite localisation and the rec- 
tangle partition of the picture induced by a given 
polygon. For example PR((left,top), (:ENTER) 
computes the upper left rectangle according to the 
partition scheme shown in figure 8. 
? !R denotes the set of the real numbers. Given a 
polygon P, the fimction f, f : POLY ~ N computes 
the area of a polygon. It is f(P~) = O. 
The applicability degree of a composite localisation 
evaluates how good the position of the object in ques- 
tion is described by that particular localisation. We de- 
fine the applicability degree as the portion of the area of 
the object that lies in the rectangle of the picture that 
corresponds to the composite localisation and the rec- 
tangle partition of that picture. Thus we can define A~ 
as follows: 
Ac : CLOC X POLY ~ ,~ 
A~(I, LO) = f (p )  
f (LO)  
with p = PR(I, CENTER) Cl LO 
bosom 
Figure 9: Computing absolute localisations 
For elementary localisations we adopted an analogous 
definition: the applicability degree Ae of an elementary 
localisation is determined by the portion of the area of 
the object that lies in the corresponding row or column 
of the picture. As already mentioned at the beginning 
of this section we can write A~ in terms of A~ : 
A~ : XLOC :x: POLY ~ 
A~(l,:, LO) : Z A~((l=, ly), LO) 
l vEYLOC 
Ae y : YLOC ? POLY 
A~e(ly, LO) = ~ A~((l~:, ly), LO) 
I=EXLOC 
Ae : ULOC X POLY ~ 
,fi ,' 
A~ and A~ compute tile applicability for the horizon- 
tal and vertical dimension by summing up the applicabil- 
ity degrees of the corresponding composite localisations. 
They are combined ill A? order to have a function that 
is defined oll both dimensions, i.e., ULOC. 
With respect o figure 9 we get: 
A~(top, LO) = A?((left, top), LO) + A?((x- 
center, top), LO) = 1/4, 
A~(y-center, LO) = A~((left, y-center), LO) + 
A?((x-center, y-center), LO) = 3/4, 
A~(left, LO) = A?((left, top), LO) + Ac((left, 
y-center), LO) : 1/:3 aim 
A~(x-center, LO) = A~((x-center, top), LO) + 
A~.((x-center, y-center), LO) = 2/:3.

As argued in l)aragraph 2.4 corner localisations 
are similar to composite (' left'/ 'r ight', top'/ 'bottorn')-  
localisations, but less general. This property can be 
modelled by corner regions that are smaller than tim 
corner regions for absolute localisations. In turn, these 
corner regions correspond to a larger center as shown in 
figure 10. Thus we can compute corner localisations just 
by changing the size of the center.

Figure 10: Tim relation between corner and center re- 
gions 
Instead of 1/3 as for absolute localisations we take 4/5 
of the horizontal and vertical extension of the picture for 
the extended center. 
3.2 Relat ive  local isat ions 
The localisation procedure for relative localisations is 
similar to the one for absolute localisations. One ma- 
jor difference is that now the construction of the hori- 
zonta.l and vertical reference frame is done with respect 
to a given reference object and not to the implicit as- 
sumed center of the picture (c.f. figure 11). The second 
difference concerns the computation of the applicability 
degree: for relative localisations, not only the portion 
of an area is taken into account, but also the distance 
between the primary object and the reference object.

Figure 11: The construction of the reference frame for 
relative localisations 
The basic idea for the evaluation of the distance be- 
tween primary object and reference object is adopted 
from the C,1TYTOUR system: first we compute the cen- 
ter of gravity for the primary object. Then we determine 
its coordinates with respect to the reference system es- 
tablished by the reference object. Finally we use these 
coordinates for the computation of the applicability de- 
gree. Figure 12 illustrates the various factors that affect 
the applicability of an 'above'-localisation: 
1. The applicability degree decreases with an increas- 
ing vertical distance. In Part A of figure 12 the ap- 
2. 
. 
plicability degree for "P1 is above REFO" is greater 
than for "P2 is above REFO." 
The applicability degree decreases with an increas- 
ing horizontal distance. In Part B the applicability 
degree for "P3 is above REFO" is greater than for 
"P4 is above REFO." 
If the horizontal and vertical distances increase by 
the same amount, then the applicability degree de- 
creases more with the increasing horizontal distance 
than with the increasing vertical distance. This is 
shown in Part C: the applicability degree for "P6 
is above REFO" is greater than for "P7 is above 
REFO", although the vertical distance between P5 
and P6 and the horizontal distance between P5 and 
/?7 are equal.

Figure 12: Evaluating tile distance of a point 
Let eval denote the function that evaluates the dis- 
tance between a point and a rectangle according to the 
criteria mentioned above. Let further POINT denote the 
set of all points within a picture and RECT C POLY the 
set of all rectangular polygons. Then the signature oi 
eval can be written as2: 
eval : CLOC ? POINT ? RECT ~ ~}~ 
Now we are almost able to define the function Ac, which 
computes the applicability degree of a composite lo- 
calisation. Let CG,  CG : POLY  ~ POINT  , compute 
the center of gravity for a polygon and let further SR, 
SR : POLY  ~ RECT , compute the smallest surrounding 
rectangle for a polygon. Then the applicability degree 
Ac of a composite localisation can be defined as: 
Ac : CLOC ? POLY  X POLY  ~ {}~ 
Ac( l, LO, REFO) = w eval( l, CG(p), SR(REFO)) 
with p = PR(I, REFO) fq LO 
f(P) 
W - -  - -  
f (LO) 
2In reality eval is slightly more complicated because it 
maps into ~' ? ~' and not only into 3. The reason for this is 
that the different evaluation of increasing vertical and hori- 
zontal distances can result in different evaluations for points 
to which both a horizontal or vertical ocalisation can be ap- 
plied. E.g., P7 in figure 12 would get a different evaluation foJ 
an 'above'- than for a 'right of'-localisation. Therefore, thes~ 
two values would be grouped to a tuple. For the computatior 
of an elementary localisation 1E XLOC we would sum up th~ 
first component of the tuple. If 1 E YLOC, we take the seconc 
component. We abstract from this detail in order to mak~ 
the principle of the procedure clearer. 
60
p is tile part of the primary object that lies in the 
rectangle corresponding to the composite localisation I.
The factor w weighs the result of eval according to the 
portion of the area of the primary object that lies in the 
rectangle corresponding to I. 
Now the definition of Ae, the applicability degree for 
an elementary localisation, can be given in terms of A~ 
again: 
A~ : XLOC ? POLY ? POLY ~ 
A~(l~, LO, REFO) = ~ A?((b:, Iv), LO, REFO) 
IuEYLOC 
A~ : YLOC ? POLY ? POLY ~ 
A~(l v LO, REFO) = ~ A~((I~, Iv), LO, REFO) 
I : :EXLOC 
Ae : ULOC X POLY ? POLY ~ 
Ae(I, LO, REFO) = I A~(I, LO, REFO) if l E XLOC 
? A~(l, LO, REFO) if l E YLOC 
This means that the applicability degree Ae for a pri- 
mary object LO is the sum of the coml)osite localisa- 
tions for tlle corresponding row or colunm of tile refer- 
ence  fr anle. 
For figure 1:3 we get, the following results: 
A~((x-center, top), LO, REFO) 
-5 -  l eval((x-center, top), P1, SR(REFO) 
__  1 - 5"0"7=0"23 
A~((right, top), LO, REFO)

2 = 5 * 0.65 = 0.43 
A?(l, LO, REFO) 
= 0 as for all other I E CLOC: : w -- - - f (P )  -- 0 
f (LO) 
Ae(top, LO, REFO) 
= Ac((x-center, top), LO, REFO)+ 
A~((right, top), LO, REFO) = 0.66 
A~(right, LO, REFO) 
= A~((right, top), LO, REFO) = 0.43 
Ae(x-center, LO, REFO) 
= A?((x-center, top), LO, REFO) = 0.23 
4 A generic localisation procedure for 
absolute and re la t ive  loca l i sa t ions  
The similarities between the localisation procedures dis- 
cussed in the previous section allow us to design one 
generic localisation procedure that can be specialised to 
a procedure for absolute, relative or corner localisations. 
Given the primary object, LO and the reference object 
REFO the first step is to determine the 3 x 3 matrix M n, 
which contains the intersection polygons of LO and the 
partial rectangles in the picture with respect o REFO. 
For relative localisations, REFO varies, for absolute lo- 
calisations and corner localisations the parameter is set 
to either the normal or the extended center area (c.f. 
section 3.1). Thus, for x E XLOC, y E YLOC we compute 
M~v = PR((x,  y), REFO) M LO 
P2 
Pl\[-LO ? \]

REFO j . , .  
Figure 13: Computing relative localisations 
The second step is the computation of the evaluation 
matrix M A, which contains the applicability degrees of 
the composite localisations. The computation requires a 
fimction E, E : POLY ?POLY ?POLY ~ ~.  E corresponds 
exactly to the flmction Ae for absolute and relative local- 
isations in section 3.1 and 3.2. The only difference results 
from tile previous computation of Mn: tile subexpres- 
sion p = PR((x,  y), REFO) M LO is factored from A? and 
therefore computed only once. 
MAu = E(M2,u, LO, REFO) 
The third step is the computation of the elementary lo- 
calisations. The vector )~ contains the evaluations of the 
horizontal localisations and \]7 the ones for the vertical 
localisations: 
yEYLOC 
xEXLOC 
This means that we have -~t = Ae(l) for l E XLOC and 
= A~(l) for l E YLOC. 
Finally, we can determine the best composite and el- 
ementary localisation and their applicability degrees by 
computing the maximum value of M A and X or )7 re- 
spectively. 
For figure 13 we get 
0 0.23 0.43 ) 
M A = 0 0 0 , 
0 0 0 
~g = (0 0.2:3 o.43) and ~ = (0.66 0 0). The best compos- 
ite localisation is "(right, top)" with applicability degree 
0.4:3. The best elementary localisation is "top" with ap- 
plicability degree 0.66. 
5 Localising objects in a complex scene 
In the previous sections we considered pictures with 
a minimal number of objects. In order to deal with 
more complex object configurations the localisation pro- 
cedures presented above have to be extended. Tile new 
task is no longer "Localise LO with respect o REFO!'" 
but "Given a set of REFO candidates, choose tile best 
one for LO!" 
61
In order to reduce the search space for REFO candi- 
dates, f rst  a kind of 'between'-test i  applied to the set 
of possible reference objects. The idea behind this test 
is that an exclusion procedure based on simple geomet- 
ric overlapping tests can be performed more efficiently 
than a comparison of applicability degrees that have to 
be computed by the rather complex localisation proce- 
dures. An example is given in figure 14: When searching 
for a suitable reference object for object A in figure 14, 
object D would be ruled out because object B is found 
in the 'between'-area of A and D.

configurations 
The deterinination of the best reference object raises 
the problem of ambiguity. Not only is the applicability 
degree of a localisation important, but also whether the 
use of the reference object would result in an ambiguous 
localisation. In that case, a different reference object 
has to be chosen. If all possible localisations are am- 
biguous, then the particular object cannot be loealised 
at. all. E.g., in Part A of figure 15 object D could be 
localised as being either "above A" or "to the right of 
(:." But the first localisation is ambiguous because both, 
C and D, are "above A." 
A. B. C. 
Figure 15: Ambiguous reference objects 
With respect to elementary and composite localisa- 
tions we distinguish three cases of ambiguity: 
1. In Part A of figure 15, the localisation of object (I or 
D would be ambiguous with respect o A because for 
both objects the composite localisations, (x-center, 
top), are equal. 
2. In Part B a composite localisation cannot be applied 
to object D (neither "D is above and to the right of 
A" nor "D is immediately above A" are adequate) 
and its elementary localisation, 'top',  is part of the 
composite localisation, (x-center, top), of object C. 
3. In Part C a composite localisation can be applied 
neither to C nor to D and their elementary locali- 
sations, 'top',  are equal. 
6 Localising Groups of Objects 
Control knobs and switches are often grouped together 
in a control panel in order to provide for easier operation 
of technical devices. Moreover spatially adjacent objects 
can also be grouped as one perceptual unit according 
to the 'law of the good gestalt' in Gestalt psychology 
(\[Murch and Woodworth, 1978\]). Thus the possibility 
to generate loealisations with respect to a given group 
structure is neccessary for the "naturalness" of a local- 
isation. Besides this, group localisations are also useful 
if the objects in the immediate neighbourhood of the 
primary object have exactly the same properties (c.f. 
\[Wahlsterel al., 1978\]). In th s case, the primary ob- 
ject can be localised with respect to its group and has 
not to be localised with respect o the whole scene, which 
could have resulted in an ambiguous localisation. 
For our localisation procedures this means that groups 
can function as a reference object as well as a primary 
object.. In addition, objects can be localised absolutely 
with respect o the group they are contained in. In figure 
16 object B would be localised as the object "to the right 
of the triangles." Vice versa we can say "The triangles 
to the left of object B" and we can localise object A as 
being "the upper left of the triangles that are to the left 
of B." 
Figure 16: Group localisations 
The last example also illustrates the hierarchical char- 
acter of group localisations: An object can be localisec 
absolutely within a group. This group might be localisec 
again within a surrounding roup or - -  if there is non( 
- -  this group can be localised relatively with respect t( 
another (group of) object(s). 
The algorithm for group localisations cannot detecl 
group hierarchies. Instead it expects a tree representa- 
tion of tile group hierarchy as an input. The output con 
sists of two parts: According to the depth of the grout 
tree the algorithm computes a chain of absolute locali 
sations. In addition the outermost surrounding roup o 
the primary object is localised relatively to an optiona 
(group of) reference object(s). 
7 Conclusions 
We have introduced a unifying approach for absolute 
relative and corner localisations of objects in pictures, h 
addition, the use of a special partition scheme for the ref 
erence frame of a preposition allows us to deal with tw, 
different localisation granularities for absolute and rela 
tire localisations. By defining the evaluation function 
62
for elementary localisations in terms of the evaluation 
fimctions for the corresponding composite localisations, 
we have been able to design one procedure that handles 
all three locMisation types and both localisation granu- 
larities efficiently. Furthermore, we have given a solution 
to the problem of localising an object within a complex 
configuration on the basis of this localisation procedure. 
Finally, we have shown how our system deals with group 
localisations.
