In this paper, we want to describe the ar- 
chitecture and some of the implementation 
issues of a large scale category guesser for 
Dutch medical vocabulary. We Mso provide 
numerical data on the precision and cover- 
age of this category guesser, which has to 
cover for the moment only the vocabulary 
of the cardiology domain. The category 
guesser uses non-morphologic information 
(endstring matching) as well as truly mor- 
phologic knowledge (inflection, derivation 
and compounding). Since we deal with 
a sublanguage some linguistic features are 
easier to handle (Grishman and Kittredge, 
1986), (Sager et al, 1987). Subsequently 
we will describe in detail the differents 
parts which interact o successfully identify 
unknown medical words.

1.1 NLP in medic ine 
Medical patient reports consists mainly of free text, 
combined with results of various laboratories. While 
numerical data can easily be stored and processed for 
archiving and research purposes, free text is rather 
difficult to be treated by computer, although it con- 
tains the most relevant information. Several authors 
put forward the hypothesis that Natural Language 
Processing (NLP) and Knowledge Representation 
(KR) of medical discharge summaries have become 
the key-issues in the domMn of intelligent medical in- 
formation processing (Baud et al, 1992), (Gabrieli 
and Speth, 1987), (McCray, 1991). However, only a 
few NLP-driven systems have actually been imple- 
mented (Friedman and Johnson, 1992) . For Dutch, 
a limited prototype has been developed (Spyns, 
1991), (Spyns and Adriaens, 1992). A broader sys- 
tem covering a larger part of the Dutch grammar and 
medical vocabulary is currently under development?

This activity forms part of the MENELAS-project 1 
? This project comprises a morphological, syntactic, 
semantic and pragmatic analysis of the medical sub- 
language for Dutch, English and French (Spyns et 
al., 1992). The project also focuses on Knowledge 
Representation (by means of Conceptual Graphs) 
(Sowa, 1984), (Volot et al, 1993) and Production 
Systems (Bouaud and Zweigenbaum, 1992). 
1.2 The Category Guesser for Dutch 
Medical Language 
This paper focuses on the morphological and lex- 
ical component of the system, which is a combi- 
nation of a database application and a Prolog rule 
interpreter. This component is already functioning 
and is used continuously during the current exten- 
sion of the coverage of the Dutch grammar (Spyns 
et al, 1993). The importance of morphologic analy- 
sis of medical vocabulary has been widely recognised 
(Wingert, 1985), (Wolff, 1984), (Dujols et al, 1991), 
(Pacak and Pratt, 1969) (Pacak and Pratt, 1978), 
(Norton, 1983)? 
In the following sections, we will describe the dif- 
ferent parts which interact o identify the word forms 
of a given sentence? The various stages of the anal- 
ysis of the word forms are described? A major dis- 
tinction can be made between forms "known by the 
system" (= stored in the dictionary cf. section 2) and 
unknown forms whose linguistic characteristics need 
to be computed and are hypothetical. The latter 
can be based on morphologic knowledge (section 3) 
or other heuristics (sections 4, 5 ~z 6). Each section 
is illustrated by an example or some implementation 
details. A schematic overview of the architecture of 
the category guesser is presented in section 7. The 
subsequent section (8) is devoted to the evaluation, 
which will guide the further elaboration of the here 
described category guesser. The paper ends with a 
conclusion and discussion (section 9).

2 Fu l l  Form D ic t ionary  
The lexical database for Dutch was built using sev- 
eral resources: an existing electronic valency dic- 
tionary and a list of words extracted from a medi- 
cal corpus (cardiology patient discharge summaries). 
The already existing electronic dictionary (resulting 
from the K.U. Leuven PROTON-project (Dehaspe 
and Van Langendonck, ) and the newly coded entries 
were converted and merged into a common represen- 
tation in a relational database (Dehaspe, 1993). 
It is intended to use the category guesser (cf. infra) 
as little as possible. To that extent, the dictionary is 
conceived as a full-form dictionary. Currently, there 
are some 100.000 full forms in the lexical database 
(which is some 8000 non inflected forms). How- 
ever, since an exhaustive dictionary is an unrealistic 
assumption, a category guesser handles all the un- 
known word forms. 
The unknown words trigger a set of rules to iden- 
tify the surface form, to attribute syntactic cate- 
gories to it, and to calculate the possible canoni- 
cal form(s). The category guesser can also enhance 
the robustness of the larger NLP-system since mis- 
spelled words can receive, to a certain extent, cor- 
rect syntactic features. To reach this aim, the cat- 
egory guesser combines morphologic (3) as well as 
non morphologic knowledge (sections 4 & 6). 
3 Morpho log ica l  Ana lys i s  
3.1 P re l iminary  Remarks  
The morphological nalyser consists mainly of three 
sections, which correspond more or less to the three 
linguistic operations on words: inflection, derivation 
and compounding. However, from an implementa- 
tional point of view, the boundaries between deriva- 
tion and compounding are defined in a different way. 
The compounds, created by agglutination or com- 
bined by means of a hyphen are computationally 
treated as non-compounds. This implies that the 
same segmentation routine can be used for the com- 
putation of derivations and monolithical compounds 
(Spyns and De Wachter, 1995). 
151 
3.2 In f lec t ion  
The inflection analyser produces one or more bun- 
dles of morphosyntactic feature value pairs for each 
submitted surface form (= cohort). The generated 
feature bundles comprise, among other features, the 
surface form (lex), the supposed canonical form 
(nlAu) as well as its category (cat) 2 A reduced 
example of the cohort produced for "geprobeerd" 
(Eng.: "tried")follows (see figure 1). 
The initial cohort will later on be reduced as much 
as possible (the ideal result in most cases being a sin- 
gle feature bundle). Therefore, a cascading priority 
system has been defined. The attribute "mort" ex- 
presses the quality of the analysis, possible values 
being segm, suffix, string or guess with segm > suf- 
fix > string > guess. More details on this will be 
given below. 
Only the feature bundles of supposed nouns, 
verbs, adjectives and adverbs (i.e. the open cate- 
gories) are admitted in the initial set of hazardous 
analyses or cohort. 
3.3 Segmentat ion  
Derivation and monolithical compounding are used 
to try and identify as many as possible of the canon- 
ical forms computed by the inflectional analyser. 
The starting principle here is that the right part 
of the computed canonical form usually constitutes 
the grammatical head of the whole word. The 
whole word thus inherits the feature-bundle associ- 
ated with its right part (Selkirk, 1982, p.150) 3 
In opposition to William (Williams, 1983) & 
Selkirk (Selkirk, 1982), we do not allow inflectional 
suffixes to be heads. The right part can be found in 
the dictionary (monolithical compounding) or in a 
list of suffixes (derivation). In the current segmen- 
tation program, the major part of this list contains 
medical suffixes, which constitute a clearly definable 
2v for verbs, adj for adjectives and n for noun; others 
are nb \[sing or phr\] for number, pers \[1, 2, 3 or nil\] for 
person. 
3We are fully aware that linguistic reality is more 
complex: e.g. some derivations (f.i. Dutch diminutifs 
cf. (Ritchie et al, 1992)) are regarded as left headed. 
Maybe they should be treated computationally by the 
inflectional analyser. 
set that is fairly regular in its (morphological nd 
syntactic) behaviour (Dujols et al, 1991). Below 
(see figure 2) one can find an extract of the suffix 
list. 
su f f i x  ( \[a, r ,  i ,  s \ ] ,  \ [cat  : ad j ,  nb: sing\] ) .  
su f f i x  ( \[a, a, 1 \ ] ,  \ [cat  : adj,nb : sing\] ) .  
suff ix ( \[i, e\] , \[cat : n, nb: s in~ ). 
Figure 2: Examples of Suffixes with Feature Bundle 
The computed canonical form is scanned and seg- 
mentated from right to left. All possible solutions 
are generated by a failure driven loop (no exclusive 
longest match principle). The segmentation rou- 
tine which tries to identify a right part (head:dict or 
head:suffix) and then tries to recognize the remain- 
ing left part. If this succeeds, the segmentation is 
complete (morf:segm). Otherwise, it is only partial 
(morf: suffix). 
At the moment, only noun noun compounds are 
treated. Many medical noun noun compounds com- 
bine a medical non head part with a non medical 
head part (f i .  hartziekte- Eng.: heartdisease). 
Only those feature bundles of the cohort are kept 
that are compatible (by means of graph-unification) 
with the feature bundle associated with the head 
part (suffix or dictionary entry). At this stage of 
filtering, the feature cat (syntactic ategory) plays a 
most prominent role. 
4 Endstr ing Matching 
When nothing can be predicted by means of mor- 
phology, another heuristic will be applied to reduce 
the set of remaining possible morphological nalyses. 
This stage will focus more on the general anguage 
words. It is based on a series of endstrings (not lim- 
ited by morphological boundaries) which determine 
the category of a word. Only the open syntactic 
classes are taken into account (noun, verb, adjective 
and adverb). Some endstrings uniquely identify the 
category of a word while others are more equivocal. 
The latter are correlated with two or even three cat- 
egories. The necessary linguistic knowledge to build 
a list of non-inflected endstrings and their associ- 
ated category (or categories) was found in Lemmens 
(Lemmens, 1989). Some combinations of an end- 
string and its category are shown below (see figure 
3). 
When a computed lexical form is presented to 
the endstring matcher, the above mentioned list is 
checked to see if an endstring constitutes the endpart 
of the submitted word. In fact, the surface form as 
well as the hypothetical canonical form of the fea- 
ture bundle are submitted to the endstring matcher. 
Only the categories resulting of both matching pro- 
cesses (= the intersection) are finally retained. Sub-

Figure 3: Some endstring-category combinations 
sequently, the feature bundle(s) of the cohort con- 
taining the proposed syntactic ategory are extended 
with an extra featurevaluepair (morf:string). Below 
(see figure 4) the result of endstring matching ap- 
plied to the verb "geprobeerd" (Eng.: "tried") is 
shown (rule with ending -eerd applies) 4 
The inflection rules were able to produce a canon- 
ical form together with its category which the end- 
string matcher considers correct. This implies that 
the inflection rule was correctly triggered and ap- 
plied. As a corollary, the other syntactic information 
in such a validated feature bundle (with morf:string) 
is supposed to be correct as well. However, many 
syntactic features are underspecified 5 
5 Default or Catch All Rule 
If none of the aforementioned cases apply, the com- 
puted canonical forms and its corresponding gram- 
matical features are pure guesses. The complete co- 
hort is retained and each of its feature bundles is 
extended with one extra feature morf: guess. 
6 F inal  select ion of the  set of 
so lut ions 
After the stages mentioned above, only a subset of 
feature bundles of the cohort will contain the fea- 
ture morf. All of these feature bundles contain mor- 
phosyntactic information that is validated by the 
mentioned heuristics (cf. supra) 6 This subset is 
retained and passed to the syntactic parser. When 
segmentations of both types (complete versus par- 
tial) are produced, the latter (morf:suffix) are dis- 
carded in favour of the former (morf:segm). In that 
case, endstring matching nor the catch all rule is 
applied. 
7 Schematic Overview 
Below, one can find a more formal description and 
a schematic overview (see figure 5) of the category 
guesser. 
4We assume of course that the verb does not appear 
in the dictionaries. 
5The Syntactic analyser requires the presence of some 
linguistic features - -  even when underspecified - -  in the 
feature bundle. 
SWhen the default rule applied, the subset will be 
identical to the complete cohort. Validation is a too 
strong word in this case.

8 Some Results  and Statistics 
To examine the effectiveness of the category guesser, 
all the words from the corpus not appearing in the 
dictionary were submitted to the analyser. The to- 
tal number of unknown words was 2832. Manual 
categorisation revealed the presence of 679 adjec- 
tives, 2056 nouns, 82 verbs. The 2832 unique un- 
known forms lead to the generation of 6342 supposed 
analyses, which means that for every unknown form 
2.4 possible canonical forms are retained. We con- 
sider the case when an unknown surface form re- 
ceives more than two different categories as a guess. 
Guesses are always interpreted as bad. If the cate- 
gory guesser is not able to attribute a correct cate- 
gory, the result is regarded as bad. Once a correct 
category, even concurrently with an incorrect one, 
is assigned to the submitted word, the outcome is 
perceived as good. 7 As the main concern lies with 
the syntactic haracteristics, we did not consider an 
erroneously calculated canonical form as a reason to 
reject the complete feature bundle. Manual exami- 
nation of the results permits us to state that 83.4 % 
of the unknown forms are correctly identified. We 
consider the result as fairly good and are convinced 
that refinements can lead to an even better result. 
The linguistic coverage can be still be improved by 
adding rules in order to treat comparatives and su- 
perlatives. 
9 Discussion 
A choice was to be made between keeping more po- 
tential analyses likely to be correct versus restrict- 
ing the cohort to one (or a limited set of) analy- 
sis which may be incorrect. As a general strategy, 
we prefer to restrict as early as possible the search 
space on all the levels of the language understanding 
system. Otherwise useless hypotheses will be prop- 
agated through the whole system causing a combi- 
natorial explosion. However, this attitude can lead 
to the rejection of valid solutions and, in the worst 
case, can be responsible for a complete failure of the 
language understanding system. 
A possible optimisation resides in the storage of 
the medical suffixes and endstrings in their inflected 
forms. They could be integrated in the already ex- 
isting full form dictionary. In order to accelerate 
the decomposition phases, the morphemes or strings 
could be stored in reversed order. 
These reorganisations of the data structures also 
influence the high level algorithm (cf. section 7). 
Since all the words, suffixes and endstrings would be 
stored in the database as full forms, the inflectional 
analyser (cf. section 3.2) would be merely needed for 
7Sometimes the surface form alone does not permit 
an unequivocal categorization (f.i. in principle, a Dutch 
noun formally equals the first person singular present of 
a regular verb). 
the computation of a hypothetical canonical form 
and its syntactic characteristics when applying the 
catch all rule. This leads without any doubt to a 
faster execution of the category guesser as a whole. 
As a corollary, the overall architecture of the entire 
component becomes impler and more homogeneous.
