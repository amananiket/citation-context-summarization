Abstract
We explored novel automatic evaluation
measures for machine translation output
oriented to the syntactic structure of the
sentence: the BLEU score on the detailed
Part-of-Speech (POS) tags as well as the
precision, recall and F-measure obtained
on POS n-grams. We also introduced F-
measure based on both word and POS n-
grams. Correlations between the new met-
rics and human judgments were calcu-
lated on the data of the first, second and
third shared task of the Statistical Machine
Translation Workshop. Machine transla-
tion outputs in four different European
languages were taken into account: En-
glish, Spanish, French and German. The
results show that the new measures cor-
relate very well with the human judge-
ments and that they are competitive with
the widely used BLEU, METEOR and TER
metrics.
1 Introduction
We proposed several syntax-oriented automatic
evaluation measures based on sequences of POS
tags and investigated how they correlate with hu-
man judgments. The new measures are the POS-
BLEU score, i.e. the BLEU score calculated on
POS tags instead of words, as well as the POSP, the
POSR and the POSF score: precision, recall and F-
measure calculated on POS n-grams. In addition
to the metrics based only on POS tags, we investi-
gated a WPF score, i.e. an F-measure which takes
into account both word and POS n-grams.
The correlations on the document level were
computed on the English, French, Spanish and
German texts generated by various translation sys-
tems in the framework of the first (Koehn and
Monz, 2006), second (Callison-Burch et al, 2007)
and third shared translation task (Callison-Burch
et al, 2008). Preliminary experiments were car-
ried out on the data from the first (2006) and
the second task (2007) ? Spearman?s rank corre-
lation coefficients between the adequacy and flu-
ency scores and the POSBLEU, POSP, POSR and
POSF scores were calculated. The POSBLEU and
the POSF score were shown to be the most promis-
ing, so that these metrics were submitted to the
official shared evaluation task 2008. The results
of this evaluation showed that these metrics also
correlate well on the document level with another
human score, i.e. the sentence ranking. However,
on the sentence level the results were less promis-
ing. The possible reason for this is the main draw-
back of the metrics based on pure POS tags, i.e.
neglecting the lexical aspect. Therefore we also
introduced a WPF score which takes into account
both word n-grams and POS n-grams.
2 Syntactic-oriented evaluation metrics
We investigated the following metrics oriented on
the syntactic structure of a translation output:
? POSBLEU
The standard BLEU score (Papineni et al,
2002) calculated on POS tags instead of
words;
? POSP
POS n-gram precision: percentage of POS n-
grams in the hypothesis which have a coun-
terpart in the reference;
? POSR
Recall measure based on POS n-grams: per-
centage of POS n-grams in the reference
which are also present in the hypothesis;
? POSF
POS n-gram based F-measure: takes into ac-
count all POS n-grams which have a counter-
29
part, both in the reference and in the hypoth-
esis.
? WPF
F-measure based both on word and POS n-
grams: takes into account all word n-grams
and all POS n-grams which have a counter-
part both in the corresponding reference and
hypothesis.
The prerequisite for all metrics is availability of
an appropriate POS tagger for the target language.
It should be noted that the POS tags cannot be only
basic but must have all details (e.g. verb tenses,
cases, number, gender, etc.).
The n-gram scores as well as the POSBLEU
score are based on fourgrams (i.e. the value of
maximal n is 4). For the n-gram-based measures,
two types of n-gram averaging were investigated:
geometric mean and aritmetic mean. Geometric
mean is already widely used in the BLEU score, but
is also argued not to be optimal because the score
becomes equal to zero even if only one of the n-
gram counts is equal to zero. However, this prob-
lem is probably less critical for POS-based metrics
because the tag set sizes are much smaller than vo-
cabulary sizes.
3 Correlations between the new metrics
and human judgments
The syntax-oriented evaluation metrics were com-
pared with human judgments by means of Spear-
man correlation coefficients ?. Spearman?s rank
correlation coefficient is equivalent to Pearson cor-
relation on ranks, and its advantage is that it makes
fewer assumptions about the data. The possible
values of ? range between 1 (if all systems are
ranked in the same order) and -1 (if all systems are
ranked in the reverse order). Thus the higher value
of ? for an automatic metric, the more similar it
is to the human metric. Correlation coefficients
between human scores and three well-known au-
tomatic measures BLEU, METEOR and TER were
calculated as well, in order to see how the new
metrics perform in comparison with widely used
metrics. The scores were calculated for outputs
of translation from Spanish, French and German
into English and vice versa. English and Ger-
man POS tags were produced using the TnT tag-
ger (Brants, 2000), Spanish texts were annotated
using the FreeLing analyser (Carreras et al, 2004),
and French texts using the TreeTagger1. In this
way, all references and hypotheses were provided
with detailed POS tags.
Experiments on 2006 and 2007 test data
The preliminary experiments with the new eval-
uation metrics were performed on the data from
the first two shared tasks in order to investigate
Spearman correlation coefficients ? between POS-
based evaluation measures and the human scores
adequacy and fluency. The metrics described in
Section 2 (except the WPF score) were calculated
for all translation outputs. For each new metric,
the ? coefficient with the adequacy and with the
fluency score on the document level were calcu-
lated. Then the results were summarised by aver-
aging obtained coefficients over all translation out-
puts, and the average correlations are presented in
Table 1.
2006+2007 adequacy fluency
BLEU 0.590 0.544
METEOR 0.598 0.538
TER 0.496 0.479
POSBLEU 0.642 0.626
POSF gm 0.586 0.551
am 0.584 0.570
POSR gm 0.572 0.576
am 0.542 0.544
POSP gm 0.551 0.481
am 0.531 0.461
Table 1: Average system-level correlations be-
tween automatic evaluation measures and ade-
quacy/fluency scores for 2006 and 2007 test data
(gm = geometric mean for n-gram averaging, am
= arithmetic mean).
Table 1 shows that the new measures have
high ? coefficients both with respect to the ade-
quacy and to the fluency score. The POSBLEU
score has the highest correlations, followed by the
POSF score. Furthermore, the POSBLEU score has
higher correlations than each of the three widely
used metrics, and all the new metrics except the
POSP have higher correlations than the TER. The
POSF correlations with the fluency are higher than
those for the standard metrics, and with the ad-
equacy are comparable to those for the METEOR
and the BLEU score.

Table 2 presents the percentage of the docu-
ments for which the particular new metric has
higher correlation than BLEU, METEOR or TER. It
can be seen that on the majority of the documents
the POSBLEU metric outperforms all three stan-
dard measures, especially the correlation with the
fluency score. The geometric mean POSF shows
similar behaviour, having higher correlation than
the standard measures in majority of the cases but
slightly less often than the POSBLEU. The POSR
has higher correlation than the standard measures
in 50-70% of cases, and the POSP score has the
lowest percentage, 30-60%. It can be also seen
that the geometric mean averaging of the n-grams
correlates better with the human judgments more
often than the artimetic mean.
Experiments on 2008 test data
For the official shared evaluation task in 2008, the
human evaluation scores were different ? the ad-
equacy and fluency scores were abandoned being
rather time consuming and often inconsistent, and
the sentence ranking was proposed as one of the
human evaluation scores: the manual evaluators
were asked to rank translated sentences relative
to each other. RWTH participated in this shared
task with the two most promising metrics accord-
ing to the previous experiments, i.e. POSBLEU
and POSF, and the detailed results can be found
in (Callison-Burch et al, 2008). It was shown that
these metrics also correlate very well with the sen-
tence ranking on the document level. However,
on the sentence level the performance was much
weaker: a percentage of sentence pairs for which
the human comparison yields the same result as
the comparison using particular automatic metric
was not very high. We believe that the main rea-
son for this is the fact that the metrics based only
on the POS tags can assign high scores to transla-
tions without correct semantic meaning, because
they are taking into account only syntactic struc-
ture without taking into account the actual words.
For example, if the reference translation is ?This
sentence is correct?, a translation output ?This tree
is high? would have a POS-based matching score
of 100%. Therefore we introduced the WPF score
? an F-measure metrics which counts both match-
ing POS n-grams and matching word n-grams.
The ? coefficients for the POSBLEU, POSF and
WPF with the sentence ranking averaged over all
translation outputs are shown in Table 3. The cor-
relations for several known metrics are shown as
well, i.e. for the BLEU, METEOR and TER along
with their variants: METEOR-r denotes the vari-
ant optimised for ranking, whereas MBLEU and
MTER are BLEU and TER computed using the
flexible matching as used in METEOR. It can be
seen that the correlation coefficients for all three
syntactic metrics are high. The POSBLEU score
has the highest correlation with the sentence rank-
ing, followed by POSF and WPF. All three mea-
sures have higher average correlation than MTER,
MBLEU and BLEU. The purely syntactic metrics
outperform also the METEOR scores, whereas the
WPF correlations are comparable with those of the
METEOR scores.

METEOR 0.638
METEOR-r 0.603

am 0.661
WPF gm 0.600

tween automatic evaluation measures and human
ranking for 2008 test data.
Table 4 presents the percentage of the docu-
ments where the particular syntactic metric has
higher correlation with the sentence ranking than
the particular standard metric. All syntactic met-
rics have higher correlation than the MTER on al-
most all documents, and on a large number of doc-
uments than the MBLEU score. The correlations
for syntactic measures are better than those for the
BLEU score for more than 60% of documents. As
for the METEOR scores, the syntactic metrics are
comparable (about 50%).
4 Conclusions
The results presented in this article suggest that
the syntactic information has the potential to
strenghten automatic evaluation metrics, and there
are many possible directions for future work. We
proposed several syntax-oriented evaluation met-
rics based on the detailed POS tags: the POS-
BLEU score and POS-n-gram precision, recall and

F-measure, i.e. the POSP, POSR, and POSF score.
In addition, we introduced a measure which takes
into account both POS tags and words: the WPF
score. We carried out an extensive analysis of
the Spearman?s rank correlation coefficients be-
tween the syntactic evaluation metrics and the hu-
man judgments. The obtained results showed that
the new metrics correlate well with human judg-
ments, namely the adequacy and fluency scores,
as well as the sentence ranking. The results also
showed that the syntax-oriented metrics are com-
petitive with the widely used evaluation measures
BLEU, METEOR and TER. Especially promising
are the POSBLEU and the POSF score. The cor-
relations of the WPF score are slightly lower than
those of the purely POS based metrics ? however,
this metric has advantage of taking both syntactic
and lexical aspect into account.
