Abstract
In a large-scale project to list bibliograph-
ical references to all of the ca 7 000 lan-
guages of the world, the need arises to
automatically annotated the bibliographi-
cal entries with ISO-639-3 language iden-
tifiers. The task can be seen as a special
case of a more general Information Extrac-
tion problem: to classify short text snip-
pets in various languages into a large num-
ber of classes. We will explore supervised
and unsupervised approaches motivated by
distributional characterists of the specific
domain and availability of data sets. In
all cases, we make use of a database with
language names and identifiers. The sug-
gested methods are rigorously evaluated on
a fresh representative data set.
1 Introduction
There are about 7 000 languages in the world
(Hammarstr?om, 2008) and there is a quite accu-
rate database of which they are (Gordon, 2005).
Language description, i.e., producing a phonologi-
cal description, grammatical description, wordlist,
dictionary, text collection or the like, of these 7
000 languages has been on-going on a larger scale
since about 200 years. This process is fully de-
centralized, and at present there is no database over
which languages of the world have been described,
which have not, and which have partial descrip-
tions already produced (Hammarstr?om, 2007b).
We are conducting a large-scale project of listing
all published descriptive work on the languages

of the world, especially lesser-known languages.
In this project, the following problem naturally
arises:
Given: A database of the world?s languages (con-
sisting minimally of <unique-id, language-
name>-pairs)
Input: A bibliographical reference to a work with
descriptive language data of (at least one of)
the language in the database
Desired output: The identification of which lan-
guage(s) is described in the bibliographical
reference
We would like to achieve this with as little human
labour as possible. In particular, this means that
thresholds that are to be set by humans are to be
avoided. However, we will allow (and do make
use of ? see below) supervision in the form of data-
bases of language references annotated with target
language as long as they are freely available.
As an example, say that we are given a bibli-
ographical reference to a descriptive work as fol-
lows:
Dammann, Ernst 1957 Studien zum
Kwangali: Grammatik, Texte, Glossar,
Hamburg: Cram, de Gruyter & Co. [Ab-
handlungen aus dem Gebiet der Aus-
landskunde / Reihe B, V?olkerkunde,
Kulturgeschichte und Sprachen 35]
This reference happens to describe a Namibian-
Angolan language called Kwangali [kwn]. The
task is to automatically infer this, for an arbitrary
bibliographical entry in an arbitrary language, us-
ing the database of the world?s languages and/or
databases of annotated entries, but without hu-
manly tuned thresholds. (We will assume that
57
the bibliographical comes segmented into fields,
at least as to the title, though this does not matter
much.)
Unfortunately, the problem is not simply that
of a clean database lookup. As shall be seen,
the distributional characteristics of the world lan-
guage database and input data give rise to a special
case of a more general Information Extraction (IE)
problem. To be more precise, an abstract IE prob-
lem may be defined as follows:
? There is a set of natural language objects O
? There is a fixed set of categories C
? Each object in O belong to zero or more cat-
egories, i.e., there is a function C : O ?
Powerset(C)
? The task is to find classification function f
that mimics C.
The special case we are considering here is such
that:
? Each object in O contains a small amount of
text, on the order of 100 words
? The language of objects in O varies across
objects, i.e., not all objects are written in the
same language
? |C| is large, i.e., there are many classes (about
7 000 in our case)
? |C(o)| is small for most objects o ? O, i.e.,
most objects belong to very few categories
(typically exactly one category)
? Most objects o ? O contain a few tokens
that near-uniquely identifies C(o), i.e., there
are some words that are very informative as
to category, while the majority of tokens are
very little informative. (This characteristic
excludes the logical possibility that each to-
ken is fairly informative, and that the tokens
together, on an equal footing, serve to pin-
point category.)
We will explore and compare ways to exploit these
skewed distributional properties for more informed
database lookups, applied and evaluated on the
outlined reference-annotation problem.
2 Data and Specifics
The exact nature of the data at hand is felt to be
quite important for design choices in our proposed
algorithm, and is assumed to be unfamiliar to most
readers, wherefore we go through it in some detail
here.
2.1 World Language Database
The Ethnologue (Gordon, 2005) is a database that
aims to catalogue all the known living languages
of the world.
1
As far as language inventory goes,
the database is near perfect and language/dialect
divisions are generally accurate, though this issue
is thornier (Hammarstr?om, 2005).
Each language is given a unique three-letter
identifier, a canonical name and a set of variant
and/or dialect names.
2
The three-letter codes are
draft ISO-639-3 standard. This database is freely
downloadable
3
. For example, the entry for Kwan-
gali [kwn] contains the following information:
Canonical name: Kwangali
ISO 639-3: kwn
Alternative names
4
: {Kwangali,
Shisambyu, Cuangar, Sambio, Kwan-
gari, Kwangare, Sambyu, Sikwangali,
Sambiu, Kwangali, Rukwangali}.
The database contains 7 299 languages (thus 7
299 unique id:s) and a total of 42 768 name tokens.
Below are some important characteristics of these
collections:
? Neither the canonical names nor the alterna-
tive names are guaranteed to be unique (to
one language). There are 39 419 unique name
strings (but 42 768 name tokens in the data-
base!). Thus the average number of different
languages (= unique id:s) a name denotes is
1.08, the median is 1 and the maximum is 14
(for Miao).
1
It also contains some sign languages and some extinct
attested languages, but it does not aim or claim to be complete
for extinct and signed languages.
2
Further information is also given, such as number of
speakers and existence of a bible translation is also given, but
is of no concern for the present purposes.
3

download.asp accessed 20 Oct 2007.
4
The database actually makes a difference between dialect
names and other variant names. In this case Sikwangali, Ruk-
wangali, Kwangari, Kwangare are altername names denoting
Kwangali, while Sambyu is the name of a specific dialect and
Shisambyu, Sambiu, Sambio are variants of Sambyu. We will
not make use of the distinction between a dialect name and
some other alternative name.
58
? The average number of names (including the
canonical name) of a language is 5.86, the
median is 4, and the maximum is 77 (for Ar-
menian [hye]).
? It is not yet well-understood how complete
database of alternative names is. In the prepa-
ration of the test set (see Section 2.4) an at-
tempt to estimate this was made, yielding the
following results. 100 randomly chosen bib-
liographical entries contained 104 language
names in the title. 43 of these names (41.3%)
existed in the database as written. 66 (63.5%)
existed in the database allowing for variation
in spelling (cf. Section 1). A more interesting
test, which could not be carried out for prac-
tical reasons, would be to look at a language
and gather all publications relating to that lan-
guage, and collect the names occurring in ti-
tles of these. (To collect the full range of
names denoting languages used in the bodies
of such publications is probably not a well-
defined task.) The Ethnologue itself does not
systematically contain bibliographical refer-
ences, so it is not possible to deduce from
where/how the database of alternative names
was constructed.
? A rough indication of the ratio between
spelling variants versus alternative roots
among alternative names is as follows. For
each of the 7299 sets of alternative names,
we conflate the names which have an edit dis-
tance
5
of? i for i = 0, . . . , 4. The mean, me-
dian and max number of names after conflat-
ing is shown below. What this means is that
languages in the database have about 3 names
on average and another 3 spelling variants on
average.
i Mean Median Max
0 5.86 4 77 ?hye?
1 4.80 3 65 ?hye?
2 4.07 3 56 ?eng?
3 3.41 2 54 ?eng?
4 2.70 2 47 ?eng?
2.2 Bibliographical Data
Descriptive data on the languages of the world
are found in books, PhD/MA theses, journal arti-
cles, conference articles, articles in collections and

stitution alike.
manuscripts. If only a small number of languages
is covered in one publication, the title usually car-
ries sufficient information for an experienced hu-
man to deduce which language(s) is covered. On
the other hand, if a larger number of languages is
targeted, the title usually only contains approxi-
mate information as to the covered languages, e.g.,
Talen en dialecten van Nederlands Nieuw-Guinea
orWest African Language Data Sheets. The (meta-
)language [as opposed to target language] of de-
scriptive works varies (cf. Section 2.4).
2.3 Free Annotated Databases
Training of a classifier (?language annotator?) in a
supervised framework, requires a set of annotated
entries with a distribution similar to the set of en-
tries to be annotated. We know of only two such
databases which can be freely accessed
6
; WALS
and the library catalogue of MPI/EVA in Leipzig.
WALS: The bibliography for the World At-
las of Language Structures book can now
be accessed online (http://www.wals.
info/). This database contains 5633 entries
annotated to 2053 different languages.
MPI/EVA: The library catalogue for the library
of the Max Planck Institute for Evolution An-
thropology (http://biblio.eva.mpg.
de/) is queryable online. InMay 2006 it con-
tained 7266 entries annotated to 2246 differ-
ent languages.
Neither database is free from errors, impreci-
sions and inconsistencies (impressionistically 5%
of the entries contain such errors). Nevertheless,
for training and development, we used both data-
bases put together. The two databases put together,
duplicates removed, contains 8584 entries anno-
tated to 2799 different languages.
2.4 Test Data
In a large-scale on-going project, we are trying
to collect all references to descriptive work for
lesser-known languages. This is done by tediously
6
For example, the very wide coverage database world-
cat (http://www.worldcat.org/) does not index in-
dividual articles and has insufficient language annotation;
sometimes no annotation or useless categories such as
?other? or ?Papuan?. The SIL Bibliography (http://
www.ethnologue.com/bibliography.asp) is well-
annotated but contains only work produced by the SIL. (SIL
has, however, worked on very many languages, but not all
publications of the de-centralized SIL organization are listed
in the so-called SIL Bibliography.)
59
going through handbooks, overviews and biblio-
graphical for all parts of the world alike. In this
bibliography, the (meta-)language of descriptive
data is be English, German, French, Spanish, Por-
tuguese, Russian, Dutch, Italian, Chinese, Indone-
sian, Thai, Turkish, Persian, Arabic, Urdu, Nepali,
Hindi, Georgian, Japanese, Swedish, Norwegian,
Danish, Finnish and Bulgarian (in decreasing or-
der of incidence)
7
. Currently it contains 11788 en-
tries. It is this database that needs to be annotated
as to target language. The overlap with the joint
WALS-MPI/EVA database is 3984 entries.
8
Thus
11788 ? 3984 = 7804 entries remain to be an-
notated. From these 7 804 entries, 100 were ran-
domly selected and humanly annotated to form a
test set. This test set was not used in the develop-
ment at all, and was kept totally fresh for the final
tests.
3 Experiments
We conducted experiments with three different
methods, plus the enhancement of spelling varia-
tion on top of each one.
Naive Lookup: Each word in the title is looked
up as a possible language name in the world
language database and the output is the union
of all answers to the look-ups.
Term Weight Lookup: Each word is given a
weight according to the number of unique-
id:s it is associated with in the training data.
Based on these weights, the words of the
title are split into two groups; informative
and non-informative words. The output is
the union of the look-up:s of the informative
words in the world language database.
Term Weight Lookup with Group Disambiguation:
As above, except that names of genealogical
(sub-)groups and country names that occur
in the title are used for narrowing down the
result.
7
Those entries which are natively written with a different
alphabet alays also have a transliteration or translation (or
both) into ascii characters.
8
This overlap at first appears surprisingly low. Part of
the discrepancy is due to the fact that many references in the
WALS database are in fact to secondary sources, which are
not intended to be covered at all in the on-going project of
listing. Another reason for the discrepancy is due to a de-
prioritization of better-known languages as well as dictionar-
ies (as opposed to grammars) in the on-going project. Even-
tually, all unique references will of course be merged.
Following a subsection on terminology and defin-
itions, these will be presented in increasing order
of sophistication.

3.2 Naive Union Lookup
As a baseline to beat, we define a naive lookup
classifier. Given an entry e, we define naive union
lookup (NUL) as:
NUL(e) = ?
w?Words(e
t
)
LN(w)
For example, consider the following entry e:
Anne Gwena???elle Fabre 2002
?
Etude du
Samba Leko, parler d?Allani (Cameroun
du Nord, Famille Adamawa), PhD The-
sis, Universit?e de Paris III ? Sorbonne
Nouvelle
The steps in itsNUL-classification is as follows
are given in Table 2.
Finally, NUL(e) = {ndi, lse, smx, dux, lec,
ccg}, but, simply enough, e
c
= {ndi}.
The resulting accuracies are PA
NUL
(A) ?
0.15 and SA
NUL
(A) ? 0.21. NUL performs
even worse with spelling variants enabled. Not
surprisingly, NUL overclassifies a lot, i.e., it con-
sistently guesses more languages than is the case.
This is because guessing that a title word indicates
a target language just because there is one lan-
guage with such a name, is not a sound practice.
In fact, common words like du [dux], in [irr], the
[thx], to [toz], and la [wbm, lic, tdd] happen to be
names of languages (!).
3.3 Term Weight Lookup
We learn from the Naive Union Lookup experi-
ment that we cannot guess blindly which word(s)
in the title indicate the target language. Some-
thing has to be done to individate the informa-
tiveness of each word. Domain knowledge tells
us two relevant things. Firstly, a title of a pub-
lication in language description typically contains
one or few words with very precise information on
the target language(s), namely the name of the lan-
guage(s), and in addition a number of words which
recur throughout many titles, such as ?a?, ?gram-
mar?, etc. Secondly, most of the language of the
world are poorly described, there are only a few,
if any, publications with original descriptive data.
Inspired by the tf -idf measure in Information Re-
trieval (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1997), we
claim that informativeness of a word w, given an-
notated training data, can be assessed as WC(w),
i.e., the number of distinct codes associated with
w in the training data or Ethnologue database. The
idea is that a uniquitous word like ?the? will be as-
sociated with many codes, while a fairly unique
language name will be associated with only one or
a few codes. For example, consider the following
entry:
W. M. Rule 1977 A Comparative Study
of the Foe, Huli and Pole Languages
of Papua New Guinea, University of
Sydney, Australia [Oceania Linguistic
Monographs 20]
Table 3 shows the title words and their associ-
ated number of codes associated (sorted in ascend-
ing order).
So far so good, we now have an informative-
ness value for each word, but at which point (above
which value?) do the scores mean that word is a
near-unique language name rather than a relatively
ubiquitous non-informative word? Luckily, we are
assuming that there are only those two kinds of
words, and that at least one near-unique language
will appear. This means that if we cluster the val-
ues into two clusters, the two categories are likely
to emerge nicely. The simplest kind of clustering
of scalar values into two clusters is to sort the val-
ues and put the border where the relative increase
is the highest. Typically, in titles where there is
exactly one near-unique language name, the bor-
der will almost always isolate that name. In the
example above, where we actually have three near-

is the string with substitutions 1 thru i carried
out. This normalization scheme is based on extensive experience with language name searching by the

Table 2: The calculation of NUL for an example entry

border so that Foe, Pole and Huli are near-unique
and the rest are non-informative.
Now, that we have a method to isolate the group
of most informative words in a title e
t
(denoted
SIG
WC
(e
t
)), we can restrict lookup only to them.
TWL is thus defined as follows:
TWL(e) = ?
w?SIG
WC
(e
t
)
LN(w)
In the example above, TWL(e
t
) is
{fli, kjy, foi, hui} which is almost correct,
containing only a spurious [fli] because Huli is
also an alternative name for Fali in Cameroon,
nowhere near Papua New Guinea. This is a
complication that we will return to in the next
section.
The resulting accuracies jump up to
PA
TWL
(A) ? 0.57 and SA
TWL
(A) ? 0.73.
Given that we ?know? which words in the ti-
tle are the supposed near-unique language names,
we can afford, i.e., not risk too much overgenera-
tion, to allow for spelling variants. Define TWL
S
(?with spelling variants?) as:
TWL
S
(e) = ?

We get slight improvements in accuracy

The WC(w)-counts make use of the annotated
entries in the training data. An intriguing modi-
fication is to estimate WC(w) without this anno-
tation. It turns out that WC(w) can be sharply
estimated with WI(w), i.e., the raw number of en-
tries in the training set in which w occurs in the

title. This identity breaks down to the extent that a
word w occurs in many entries, all of them point-
ing to one and the same language id. From domain
knowledge, we know that this is unlikely if w is
a near-unique language name, because most lan-
guages do not have many descriptive works about
them. The TWL-classifier is now unsupervised in
the sense that it does not have to have annotated
training entries, but it still needs raw entries which
have a realistic distribution. (The test set, or the
set of entries to be annotated, can of course itself
serve as such a set.)

fact have access to annotated data, we will use the

tant to know that the unsupervised variant is nearly
as strong.
4 Term Weight Lookup with Group
Disambiguation
Again, from our domain knowledge, we know that
a large number of entries contain a ?group name?,
i.e., the name of a country, region of genealogical
(sub-)group in addition to a near-unique language
name. Since group names will naturally tend to be
associated with many codes, they will sorted into
the non-informative camp with the TWL-method,
and thus ignored. This is unfortunate, because
such group names can serve to disambiguate in-
herent small ambivalences among near-unique lan-
guage names, as in the case of Huli above. Group
names are not like language names. They are much
fewer, they are typically longer (often multi-word),
and they exhibit less spelling variation.
Fortunately, the Ethnologue database also con-
tains information on language classification and
the country (or countries) where each language
is spoken. Therefore, it was a simple task to
build a database of group names with genealog-
ical groups and sub-groups as well as countries.

groups. This database is relatively complete for
English names of (sub-)families and countries, but
should be enlarged with the corresponding names
in other languages.
We can add group-based disambiguation to
TWL as follows. The non-significant words of a
title is searched for matching group names. The set

5 Discussion
A summary of accuracy scores are given in Table
4.
All scores conform to expected intuitions and
motivations. The key step beyond naive lookup

In a few cases they were forced unique, e.g., when two
families X, Y were listed as having subgroups called Eastern
(or the like), the corresponding group names were forced to
Eastern-X and Eastern-Y respectively.

is the usage of term weighting (and the fact the
we were able to do this without a threshold or the
like).
In the future, it appears fruitful to look more
closely at automatic extraction of groups from an-
notated data. Initial experiments along this line
were unsucessful, because data with evidence for
groups is sparse. It also seems worthwhile to
take multiword language names seriously (which
is more implementational than conceptual work).
Given that near-unique language names and group
names can be reliably identified, it is easy to
generate frames for typical titles of publications
with language description data, in many languages.
Such frames can be combed over large amounts of
raw data to speed up the collection of further rel-
evant references, in the typical manner of contem-
porary Information Extraction.
6 Related Work
As far as we are aware, the same problem or an
isomorphic problem has not previously been dis-
cussed in the literature. It seems likely that isomor-
phic problems exist, perhaps in Information Ex-
traction in the bioinformatics and/or medical do-
mains, but so far we have not found such work.
The problem of language identification, i.e.,
identify the language of a (written) document
given a set of candidate languages and train-
ing data for them, is a very different problem
? requiring very different techniques (see Ham-
marstr?om (2007a) for a survey and references).
We have made important use of ideas from In-
formation Retrieval and Data Clustering.
7 Conclusion
We have presented (what is believed to be) the first
algorithms for the specific problem of annotating
language references with their target language(s).
The methods used are tailored closely to the do-
main and our knowledge of it, but it is likely that
there are isomorphic domains with the same prob-
lem(s). We have made a proper evaluation and the
accuracy achieved is definetely useful.
