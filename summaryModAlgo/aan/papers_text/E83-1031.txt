1. INTRODUCTION 
Frequent ly  a quest ioner  expects  more than  a 
d i rec t ,  l i te ra l  response  a l though he must assume 
that  the  answerer  i s  not  in fo rmed about  what  par -  
t i cu la r  in fo rmat ion  he i s  seek ing .  The quest ioner  
imputes to a cooperat ive dia logue partner the com- 
municative competence to reply to a simple yes-no 
quest ion like (I) with an extended response (cf. 
(12\], (11\]) l ike (la) rather than with a simple 
Yes. 
( I )  Are you going to t rave l  this summer? 
( la )  Yes, to Sicily. 
In the absence of special information about the 
previous course of the dialog or the intentions of 
the questioner (the unmarked case) an answer l i ke  
( la)  seems more appropriate than (Ib) or ( I c ) .  
(Ib) Yes, with an old school f r iend.  
(Ic) Yes, by plane. 
OF course, there are numerous dialog situatlons in 
which  ( lb )  os" ( l c )  cou ld  be generated  as a commun- 
i ca t ive ly  adequate  response  on the  bas is  o f  a par.  
t?cu lar  par tner  mode l .  But i t  s t i l l  must b~ asked 
why in  d ia logs  o f  the  type  ' in fo rmat ion  ,upp ly '  
the  unmarked response  takes  the  fo rm ( la )  ~nd not  
( lh )  or  ( l c ) .  
In th is  paper we w i l l  present the results of a 
computational study of this problem for the domain 
Research on HAM..ANS Is currently being supported 
by the German Min ist ry  of Research and Technology 
(8MFT) under contract 081T15038 
' locomotion verbs' in dialogs based on a v isual ly  
present world of discourse. This quest ion is par- 
t icular ly important for the construct ion of 
cooperat ive  d ia lo  9 sys tems,  s ince ,  in  many app l i -  
ca t ions ,  no exp l i c i t  knowledge about  the  d ia log  
goa ls  o f  the  quest ioner  i s  ava i lab le  a t  the  
outset .  I f  a , sys tem i s  never the less  expected  to  
'over -answer  , i .e .  to  vo lunteer  in fo rmat ion  that  
has not  spec i f i ca l ly  been requested ,  i t  must com- 
mand a set  o f  heur i s t i c  c r i te r ia  fo r  se lec t ing  the  
add i t iona l  in fo rmat ion  that  i s  to  be verba l i zed  
\ [111 .  
I t  i s  notewor thy  that  the  three  add i t iona l  po in ts  
o f  in fo rmat ion  in  ( la ) ,  ( lb ) ,  (1c)  cor respond to  
f i l l ed  deep case s lo ts  o f  the  verb  used in  the  
quest ion  (GOAL, CO-AGENT and INSTRUMENT, respec-  
t i ve ly ) .  Th is  suggests  that  the  unf i l l ed  opt iona l  
case s lo ts  in  the  quest ion  are  cand idates  fo r  
add i t iona l  in fo rmat ion .  For a quest ion  l i ke  (2 ) ,  
in  wh ich  a l l  the  deep case s lo ts  o f  'b reak '  are  
f i l l ed ,  on ly  a d i rec t  response  l i ke  (2a) i s  to  be 
expected  as a pos i t ive  answer ,  wh i le  in  (3 ) ,  where 
only the obl igatory deep case slots are fil led, an 
extended response  l i ke  (3a) can be expected .  
(2) Did you break  the  window wi th  your  s l ingshot  
yesterday?  
(2a)  Yes. 
(3) Did you break  the  window? 
(3a)  Yes, w i th  my s l ingshot .  
Since not every  opt ional  deep case o f  a g iven  verb 
unspeci f ied in the quest ion is suitable for an 
unmarked extended response  (e .g .  ( la ) - ( l c ) )  we may 
def ine  the  prob lem more prec ise ly  by ask ing  wh ich  
o f  the  deep case s lo ts  unspec i f ied  in  the  quest ion  
are  to  be chosen as the  unmarked va lues .  
For our  domain Of invest igat ion  ' locomot ion  verbs '  
le t  us cons ider  quest ions  (4) and (5 ) ,  wh ich  re fer  
to  a v i sua l ly  p resent  wor ld  o f  d i scourse .  In  each 
case perceptua l  p rocesses  are  assumed as a prere -  
qu is i te  fo r  the  answer .  
4) Which veh ic le  s topped?  
&a) The bus,  on Har tungst reet .  
4b) The bus,  because the  dr iver  s tepped on the  
brake .  
5) Did the bus turn off? 
5a) Yes, from Hartungstreet onto Schlueterstteet.  
5b) Yes, together with the tax i  cab. 
The instant iat ion of the iocat lve slot in answer 
(4a) and the source and goal slots in (Sa) is 
predictable in contrast to the causative s lot  in 
(4b) and the co agent s lot  in (5b). As examples 
(4) and (5) demonstrate, the same optional deep 
case s lot  is not always selected as the unmarked 
option. The choice is dependent upon the verb con- 
tained in the question. Moreover, {Sa) shows that 
combinations of deep cases are possible in 
unmarked extended responses, 
In the area under invest igat ion here, the follow- 
ing heurist ic carl be employed to determine the

Fig. 1: Situat ional  context of the dialog 
selection of the deep case slots for an um~marked 
extended response: Select the deep case slots 
which contain the concepts necessary for the per- 
ceptual verification of the motion descrlbed by 
the verb. 
In order to verify a stop-event it is necessary to 
determine the end point of the motion (Cf. (4a)) 
but not the cause (cf. (4b)). For a turn-off event 
a change of d i rect ion between source and goal must 
be establ ished (cf. (Sa)). It is not essent ia l  to 
determine whether other objects make this change 
of direct ion at the same time (cf. (Sb)). 
Hence case role f i l l ing fo r  the construct ion of  an 
extended response can be regarded as a side effect 
of the visual, search necessary to answer the ques- 
tion. 
This also appears plausible when seen in the l ight 
of the beliefs that the quest ioner  imputes to the 
answerer .  The quest ioner bel ieves that the 
answerer wil l  fil l in the case sluts necessary for 
answer ing  the quest ion and that it is therefore 
unnecessary to expl ic i t ly  ment ion these in the 
question. Addit ional ly the quest ioner bel ieves 
that the answerer  believes that the quest ioner 
expects an extended reply and fur this reason did 
not expl ic it ly request the addit ional  information. 
A cooperat ive dialog system fulf i l ls this user 
expectat ion by applying the heurist ic formulated 
above. 
A prerequis i te for the appl icat ion of this heuris- 
tic is that \[he system have knowledge about which 
deep case slots are relevant for the ver i f icat ion 
OF a movem~mt. This prerequis i te is not met by 
most natural language (NL) systems since they sim- 
ply represent events in the  domain or discourse in 
fully instant~ated Form using case frames, e.g. as 
part of a semantic net or frame hierarchy. In con- 
trast, the G,,rman language dialog system HAM-ANS 
(Hamburg application--oriented natural  language 
system) \[6\], which we have developed, can apply 
this heuris(~c because in addit ion to the case 
frame of each verb the system includes a represen- 
tation of the referent ial  semantics of predica- 
tions associated with that verb which makes it 
possible to ~valuate the ViSual input data for  the 
movement in question. 
The goa l  of this art icle is to elucidate the 
representat ion construct ions for case frames and 
referent ia l  semantics of verbs of motion used in 
HAM-ANS and to i l lustrate their use in generat ing 
unmarked extended responses. 
2. A SHORT OVERVIEW OF HA~-ANS 
HAM-ANS is a large German natural  l anguage dialog 
system of both considerable depth and breadth 
which presently provides access to three di f ferent  
appl icat ion classes, namely an expert system 
(hotel reservat ion situation), a database system 
( f i shery  data)  and a scene ana lys i s  system 
(traffic scene) .  
The communicat ive situations the system handles 
are character ized as follows: 
In the hotel reservat ion situation the system 
takes the role of  a hotel manager, who tries to 
persuade the user to book a room. The caller is 
assumed to have the overal l  goal of determining 
whether the room offered meets his requirements.  
The system must attempt to recognize the user s 
spec i f i c  des i res  concern ing  the  room as they  are  
revealed - usual ly indirect ly - in his utterances 
and to make use of the various devices avai lable 
in natural  language that permit the room in ques- 
tion to be presented in a part icular ly  favorable 
l ight (e.g. the generat ion of tendentious descrip- 
tions using hedged relat ive adjectives).  
In the database appl icat ion \[8\] HAM-ANS provides 
marine scientists with NL access to a f ishery 
database, which contains data col lected dur ing 
internat ional  exped i t ions  in the South At lant ic 
and the Indian Ocean. The complex structured data 
sets, which consist of cruise data concerning the 
vesse ls '  voyages , k r i l l  b io logy  data ,  re levant  
net  hau ls  and oceanograph ic  data ,  are s to red  in  a 
re la t iona l  database  (76 re la t ions .  11MByte)  w i th  
a PASCAL/R data  base management system.  
In the traff ic domain we presuppose the fol lowing 
situational  context: The system has observed a 
189 
street intersect ion and supplies on the phone the 
user, who is famil iar with the scene but cannot 
see it from his remote location, with information 
about the traff ic at that intersect ion (cf. fig. 
I). A geometr ical  descr ipt ion of the observed 
scene Is provided by the image sequence analysis 
system NAOS/HORIO \ [g \ ] .  In this appl icat ion our 
research e f fo r ts  are concerned with the handling 
of time (tense and temporal adverbs) and the 
semantics of locomotion verbs (cf .  f ig .  2).

3. REPRESENTATION FORMALISMS FOR THE SEMANTICS OF 
LOCOMOTION VERBS 
3,1.  THE GEOMETRICAL SCENE DESCRIPTION 
A basic requirement for  answering questions about 
movements that have occurred in real  sequences of 
scenes is an adequate representation of these 
sequences. Not only the shape, the centers of 
grav i ty ,  col,,r, etc. of objects must be 
represented, but also the t ra jec tor ies  of moving 
ob\]ects. 
Thls geometrical scene description consists of a 
combinat ion  o f  automat ica l ly  generated  outputs  oF 
the scene ana lys i s  p rocesses  ( inso far  as th i s  i s  
p resent ly  poss ib le )  and a number o f  manual augmen- 
ta t ions .  
The length in time of the scene under considera- 
t ion is ca. 14 sec., which corresponds.to ca. 360 
single TV images.  From these 360 lmages 72 
snapshots  are coded in a re la t iona l  fo rmal i sm,  
denot lng  which ob jec ts  were observed ,  the shape o f  
these objects, the i r  current center of grav i ty  and 
some other properties (e.g. co lor ) .  The represen - 
rat ion of the f i r s t  snapshot contains information 
about a l l  objects that are v i s ib le  at that time. 
For the successive snapshots only changes with 
respect to the predecessors are recorded, i.e. 
objects and their descr ipt ions are only entered if 
they  have changed locat ion  or appeared in  the  
scene. A tra jectory of an object is determined by 
its di f ferent centers of grav i ty  relative to an 
underly ing coordinate system. In cont ras t  to  the  
rea l  TV image sequence th i s  representat ion  i s  on ly  
2 d imens iona l  and thus prov ides  a b i rd ' s -eye  v iew 
o f  the scene. 
3.2.  THE REPRESENTATION LANGUAGES SURF AND DEEP 
The log ic -o r iented  semant ic  representat ion  
languages  SURF and DEEP are the  cent ra l  represen-  
ta t ion  fo rmal i sms used in  HAM-ANS. These languages  
are des igned to  be dec la ra t ive  and eas i ly  extend-  
ab le .  SURF i s  the ta rget  language o f  the ana lys i s  
components and source  language fo r  the generat ion  
components and thus as c lose  as poss ib le  to  NL 
u t terances ,  whereas DEEP i s  bet ter  su i ted  fo r  the  
eva luat ion  o f  u t te rances  on the bas is  o f  the  
sys tem's  domain -spec i f i c  knowledge sources .  
Or ig ina l ly  SURF and DEEP were des igned to  
represent term and pred icate  structures which  
serve  as a representat ion formal ism for state 
descr ipt ions occurr ing typical ly in the hotel 
reservation s i tuat ion .  For an adequate representa- 
t ion of the semantics of questions containing 
verbs, the de f in i t ion  of SURF and DEEP was aug- 
mented by meta -pred icates  for  mark ing  deep cases ,  
tense and vo ice  adapted f rom F i l lmore 's  deep case 
theory \[3\]. Since events can be existent ia l ly  
quant l f ied as in (6) or expl ic i t ly quant i f ied as 
in (7) 
(6) Did \]ohn f ly  to Hamburg? 
(7) Did John fly to Hamburg three times last week? 
SURF and DEEP provide a means of representing 
quant i f i ca t ion  of events. A special quant i f ie r  
E-ACT denotes an ex is tent ia l  quant i f i ca t ion  of 
events. Other quant i f ie rs  l i ke  those in (7) are 
current ly  not avai lable but can easi ly  be 
included. Examples of SURF and DEEP expressions 
are shown in the annotated example (cf .  f ig .  8). 
In th is  paper only some of the features of SURF 
and DEEP are d i scussed ,  see \ [6 \ ]  fo r  a more 
detai led descript ion. 
3.3.  THE CASE-FRAME LEXICON 
The case f rames fo r  verbs  used in  the system are 
s tored  in  the case-frame lex icon  \ [5 \ ] .  Each ent ry  
in  the word lex icon  fo r  a verb  conta ins  a po in ter  
to i t s  app l i cab le  case frame which  descr ibes  the  
semant ics  o f  that  verb  in  terms o f  case re la t ions .  
A case frame i s  represented  as a combinat ion  o f  
deep case descr ip t ions  spec i fy ing  fo r  each deep 
case i t s  name, a marker ,  whether  the deep case i s  
ob l igatory  (0) or  opt iona l  (F ) ,  and the semant ic  
res t r i c t ions  which are  requ i red  f rom a syntact i c  
subst ructure  to  f i l l  the deep case (o f .  f ig .  3 ) .  
This pointer technique permits the use of a 
speci f ic  case  frame for  several verbs during the 
ana lys i s  phase w i thout  p redetermin ing  a s ing le  
process  fo r  these verbs  dur ing  the eva luat ion  o f  
whole utterances. For verbs  with d i f fe rent  
re ferent ia l  semantics, e.g. ' to  accelerate' and 
' to  stop' ,  a single case frame, namely that speci- 
tying an obl igatory AGENT of type 'veh ic le '  and a 
optional LOCATIVE of type ' thoroughfare' ,  is 
applied during the analysis phase. 
Case frames are formulated in SURF so that the 
checking of the semantic res t r i c t ions  can be 
accomplished by the inference rules usually 
applied during the evaluation of a complete utter-- 
ance; The se lect ional  res t r i c t ion  that, e.g. ,  the 
NP a car' describe an object of the class of 
vehicles, and therefore be a possible candidate to 
f i l l  ~ the agent role of the verb ' to  stop' ,  can be 
190 
ver i f ied  because of the t rans i t i v i ty  of the super- 
set re la t ion  in the conceptual semantic net. 
In the case- f rame lex icon  the case f rames are not  
recorded  in  the form shown in  f ig .  3. but  ra ther  
are represented  as const ructor  ca l l s  fo r  bu i ld ing

3.4. OB3ECT-ORZENTEB REPRESENTATION OF MOTION 
CONCEPTS 
In object-or iented programming languages program- 
ming i s  more or  less  the ac t iv i ty  o f  c reat ing  a 
wor ld  o f  ent i t ies  ca l led  ob jec ts  and o f  spec i fy ing  
a set  o f  gener ic  operat ions  that  can be per fo rmed 
on them? Ob jects  can communicate w i th  each o ther  
by sending and rece iv ing  messages. Essent ia l l y ,  
runn ing  a program means that  the ob jec t  sends a 
message to  ar, ob jec t  (poss ib ly  to  i t se l f )  wh ich  in  
tu rn  sends a message e tc . ,  unt i l  the requ i red  task  
i s  fu l f i l l ed .  An impor tant  benef i t  o f  the ob jec t -  
oriented style is that  it lends itself  to a par- 
t icular ly simple and lucid kind of modularity.  
3.4.1. THE FLAVOR SYSTEM 
The F lavor  system \ [2 \ ]  \ [13\ ]  i s  an imp lementat ion  o f  
the language features  that  suppor t  ob jec t -o r iented  
programming. Two k inds  o f  ob jec ts  ex is t  in  a F la -  
vor  system, namely one ca l led  f l avor  and the o ther  
i ns tance  of a f lavor .  A f lavor represents a gen- 
eric object and an instance an i nd iv idua l  rea l i za -  
t ion of a ge,~eric ob ject .  It is possible to send 
messages to both k inds  of objects. F lavors  are 
organized in ,, d i rected graph called the f lavor 
graph? There is one des ignated  flavor, the 
vani l la  flays, r, which  corresponds to the th ing 
frame in FRL \[I0\]. Since the heritage of informa- 
tion for  each f lavor  is provided by the f lavor  
graph, i t  zs necessary to specify for  each newly 
defined f lavor  i t s  locat ion in the graph by naming 
i t s  d i rect  predecessors ( i t s  superf lavors).  The 
information contained in a f lavor  is a combination 
of a l l  the information inherited from i t s  super- 
f lavors  and the added information given by i t s  own 
def in i t ion .  The added information can also over- 
ride, augment or modify the inherited information. 
This is one dimension of the information contained 
in a flavor: owned or inherited. Another is the 
dec larat ive/procedura l  dist inction. The declara- 
t ive  knowle~tge of a Flavor is stored in variables 
of di f ferent kinds whereas procedural  knowledge is 
encoded in so called methods? 
One kind of variable the i ns tance  var iab le  - is 
used to give instances of the same generic object 
their individual information. The other kind - the 
c lass  var iab le  is owned by a flavor, can be 
'bequeathed '  to other f lavors ,  and accessed by any 
ob jec t  in  the f lavor  system. However,  a f lavor  i s  
on ly  a l lowed to  change a va lue  o f  a c lass  var i -  
ab le ,  if it owns this variable. 
Methods are funct ion def in i t ions that implement 
the operat ions def ined for each flavor. The combi- 
nation of methods from di f ferent  f lavors is cal led 
mix ing  f lavors.  
In compar ison w i th  FRL the F lavor  system has 
main ly  th ree  d i s t ingu ish ing  features :  
The 'A k ind  o f '  s lo t  in  FRL serves  both fo r  
es tab l i sh ing  an inher i tance  h ie rarchy  and fo r  
connect ing  ins tances  to  superc lasses ,  i .e .  no 
c lear  d i s t inc t ion  i s  made between gener ic  
f rames and ins tances ?  On the o ther  hand the  
f lavor  graph i s  bu i l t  by spec i fy ing  the 
super f lavors  fo r  each f lavor ,  ins tances  are 
c reated  by the  make- ins tance-method.  
Because the  d i s t inc t ion  between gener ic  
f rames and ins tances  i s  not  made in  FRL there  
i s  a l so  no d i s t inc t ion  between ins tance  var i -  
ab les  and c lass  var iab les ?  In the F lavor  sys -  
tem the semant ics  o f  var iab les  i s  more 
c lear ly  de f ined  in  that  ins tance  var iab les  
can on ly  be mod i f ied  in  ins tances  and c lass  
var iab les  can on ly  be mod i f ied  in  f lavors ?  
Frames in  FRL are pass ive  data  s t ruc tures ,  
whereas f lavors  can be ( re - )ac t ivated ,  
c reated  and mod i f ied ;  they  are autonomous; 
they are declarat ive and procedural  at the 
same time and hence are entit ies which are 
better suited for as formalisms for  
representing common knowledge (cf .  \ [2 \ ] ) .  
Although the f lavor  system is a tool  for  the

in their parents. Instance variables comprise 
information about the deep cases associated with 
the motion concept as wel l  as in format ion needed 
and extracted by methods. The methods are respon-- 
sible for checking the referent ia l  semantics of 
the motion concepts. Instances of a f lavor  denote 
spec i f ic  events in the domain of d iscourse  that 
could be ver i f ied  by the appl icat ion of the 
methods. 
The methods of the add i t iona l ly  defined f lavors  
TIME and SPACE are responsible for temporal and 
~;patial computations. Instances of these f lavors  
determine the temporal  and spatial  descr ipt ion of 
the actual scene: the length of the scene in time, 
the number of snapshots, the spat ia l  extent,  etc. 
The task of checking.the t ru th  value of the propo- 
s i t ion  in ;~ user s quest ion is accompl ished 
through messaqe passing. These messages include: 
creating in' Lances of motion concepts, e.g. 
TURN120, ins t . ,~t ia t ing  deep case slots specif ied 
il, the question, and act ivat ing  appropriate 
(n t !  t hod S . 
Let ' s  now con, ,zder  the example g iven  in  f ig .  5 in  
more deta i l .  '.ince only the AGENT was specif ied in 
the questioh, the selected method is 
ONLY AGENT Sl~'l !ILLED. After determinirlg an 
interval ~f c~nsideration this method calls 
further m~.thods, namely FIND_A_SOURCE, 
DIRECTION_CHAUGE and FIND_A_GOAL NEQ ~;OURCE. 
DIRECTION CIIAI;GE is a special method of the f lavor  
TURN. Th~ f i r s t  and last  methods are inher i ted 
(of. f ig .  5) from f lavor  GO_BY because they are 
also needed in that f lavor  for  answering questions 
l i ke :  'Has the yellow car driven from Biberstreet  
to Hartungstreet~' .  
FIND A SOURCE ident i f ies  the f i r s t  entry of the 
agen~'~ t ra jec tory  in the in terva l  of considera- 
t ion and checks which of the objects of the s ta t i c  
background these coordinates belong to.  For th is  
test  only those s ta t i c  objects are selected that 
satisfy the select ional  restr ict ions for the 
source slot specif ied in the case-frame lexicon. 
If the test succeeds for an object, the name o~ 
this object is stored in the source slot, 
DIRECTION CHANGE now fol lows the agent's t ra jec -  
tory look~ng for a s ign i f i cant  change of direc- 
t ion .  If this test is also posit ive, 
FIND A GOAL NEQ_SOURCE is t r ied .  This method 
searches fur a point on the t ra jec tory  which is 
not inside the ob3ect ident i f ied  in the source 
s lot .  I f  there is such a point ,  the same selec- 
t iona l  check as for the source s lot  is executed 
for  the possible goal object.  The successful 
appl icat ion of these methods yie lds a ful\] .y

F ig .  6: Ins tance  var iab les  and methods in  the 
mot ion  concept  h ie rarchy  
The fol lowing discussion of some of the processing 
phases can hi:st be understood if continual re~er- 
ence i s  made to f ig .  B, which shows a t raced  ver -  
s ion  o f  the example.  
The processing of a user's NL input starts  with a 
ra ther  elaborate lexical and morphological  
analysis - a process which on the one hand reduces 
single words to the i r  canonical forms with the i r  
morphologi<al and syntact ic  features (e.g. gender, 
person, number) and on the other hand recognizes 
syntagmatic groups of words and discontinuous verb 
constituents, transforming them according to 
predefined rules. 
The generated structure - the preterminal string 
(not shown in fi@. 8) - forms the input to the 
parser. The syntact lc  ana lys i s  cons is ts  of two 
d i f fe rent  strategies,  both of which use the same 
ATN-definit ions of syntact ic  categories, e.g. for  
noun phrases and prepos i t ional  phrases. One of

these strategies - always applied for sentences 
with  copu la  verbs  - uses a sur face  grammar to  cope 
w i th  word order var ia t ions .  The o ther  i s  a case-  
d r iven  ana lys i s  s t ra tegy  which i s  used fo r  sen- 
tences  conta in ing  verbs  w i th  an assoc ia ted  case 
f rame.  
Since in the example the verb 'to go by' has a 
case frame the second strategy is applied. After 
an access to the case-frame lexicon the case frame 
is constructed. This case frame is used to guide 
the parsing in the fo l lowing manner: The al@orithm 
f i r s t  attempts to recognize those syntact ic  con- 
s t i tuents  that are possible candidates for a deep 
case marked ob l igatory ,  and then to  recogn ize  
those const i tuents  that  are poss ib le  cand idates  
fo r  opt iona l  deep cases.  When the input  i s  com- 
p le te ly  consumed and a l l  ob l igatory  deep cases are  
f i l l ed  the process  ends .  
The test for determining if a syntactic consti- 
tuent is a possible candidate to f i l l  a spec i f ic  
deep case is divided into a syntactic and a seman- 
tic check. The syntactic check requires, e.g., 
that in order to fill the agent role a constituent 
must contain the attr ibute 'nominative' (sentence 
in act ive voice) and that i t s  number  must 
correspond to that of the verb. The semantic check 
requires that the noun of the const i tuent fu l f i l l  
the semantic res t r i c t ions  specif ied for the 
spec i f i c  deep case.  Th is  i s  accompl i shed  through 
the bu i ld ing  o f  a SURF express ion  fo r  the const i -  
tuent ,  the t rans format ion  o f  th i s  express ion  in to  
a DEEP express ion ,  and the eva luat ion  o f  the DEEP 
express ion  on the bas is  o f  the conceptua l  net .  
In our example on ly  the agent case is marked as 
ob l igatory  and the noun phrase 'wh ich  t rucks '  fu l -  
f i l l s  both the syntact i c  and semant ic  requ i rements  
to f i l l  th i s  s lo t .  S ince no o ther  syntact i c  con- 
st i tuents  are encountered ,  the complete SURF 
representation is constructed. 
The structure is normalized into a DEEP structure.  
One of the maln tasks or th is  process is the 
determination of the scope of quant i f ie rs .  The 
algorithm used for  th is  purpose is modelled a f ter  
the one described by Hendrix \ [4 \ ] ;  i t  takes into 
account the re la t ive  strength of natural  language 
quant i f ie rs  (e.g. 'a ' ,  'both ' )  and question opera-- 
tots (e.g. 'which' 'how many ). The strength is 
determined  by a numeric va lue ,  which in some cases 
i s  mod i f ied  by the degree o f  genera l i ty  o f  the 
noun. E.g. the ex is tent ia l  quant i f ie r  'a' is 
weaker than the more speci f ic  ( luant i f ie r  'both ' .

Since,  in  the example d iscussed,  the quest ion  
operator  'wh ich '  i s  s t ronger  than the ex is tent ia l  
quant i f ie r  fo r  verbs 'E -ACT' ,  the s t ruc ture  i s  
rear ranged.  
The task of  eva luat ing  a OEEP formula  i s  governed 
by a generate  and tes t  s t ra tegy .  Generate and tes t  
procedures can De viewed as being act ivated  by 
pat tern -d i rec ted  invocat ion  and d i f fe r  from each 
o ther  in  that  the generate  procedures ass ign 
in terna l  ob jec t  ident i f ie rs  to var iab les  in  DEEP 
fo rmulas ,  wh i le  the tes t  procedures y ie ld  two 
va lues ,  the f i r s t  o f  which i s  e i ther  a fu l l y  
ins tant ia ted  formula  equ iva lent  to the input  fo r -  
mula or  a mod i f ied  fo rmula ,  and the second o f  
which ind icates  the t ru th  va lue  o f  the input  fo r -  
mula in  the range \ [0 ,1 \ ] .  In the in terpretat ion  
phase these two processes in teract  in  such a way 
that  a tes t  at tempt  ac t ivates  generate  procedures 
which in  turn  ca l l  tes t  procedures and so on. 
A c loser  look  at  our example shows that  a f te r  the 
f i r s t  tes t  at tempt  has d i scovered  a s t ruc ture  con- 
ta in ing  a var iab le  in th i s  case the term 
represent ing  the noun phrase 'which t rucks '  - a 
package of  generate  procedures is  ac t ivated  to 
produce the set o f  ob jec t  ident i f ie rs  denot ing  the 
re ferent ia l  set of objects that are trucks - here 
TRUCK1 and TRUCK2. The res t  o f  the formula  is  
then recurs ive ly  sent to a tes t  process w i th  the 
var iab le  'w14' rep laced  by elements o f  the re fer -  
ence set fo r  t rucks  one a f te r  the o ther .  
The next  formula  to be tes ted  requ i res  the genera-  
t ion  of  a set of  ins tances  of  the type GO_BY. 
Since events are not represented  in  fu l l y  
ins tant ia ted  form but ra ther  must be ext rac ted  
from the geometr i ca l  scene descr ip t ion ,  a spec ia l  
set o f  procedures - the methods spec i f ied  in  the 
verb f lavor  h ie rarchy  - i s  ac t ivated .  (See sect ion  
3 .4 .2  fo r  how th i s  process funct ions , )  
A ver i f i ca t ion  o f  an event GO BY i s  poss ib le  on ly  
fo r  TRUCK2. The add i t iona l  ~nformat ion  ext rac ted  
dur in  9 the process o f  v i sua l  search - the spec i f i c  
locat ion  o f  the event - i s  recorded in  the loca -  
t i ve  s lo t .  
Dur ing the fo rmat ion  o f  the resu l t  o f  the eva lua-  
t ion ,  the system, guided by genera l  heur i s t i cs ,  
dec ides whether  the add i t iona l  deta i l  w i l l  cause 
too ~reat  a complex i ty  in the answer or  not \ [11 \ ] .  
In th i s  case the complex i ty  i s  su i tab le  and the 
locat ion  w i l l  be mentioned in  the answer. 
The word 'wh ich '  i s  de f ined  as quant i f ie r  that  
causes a descr ip t ion  of  a set o f  ob jec ts  to  be 
re turned  ( ins tead  o f  a t ru th  va lue) .  Thus the set 
o f  re ference  ob jec ts  fo r  which the propos i t ion  in  
quest ion  could be ver i f ied ,  i .e .  TRUCK2, i s  sub- 
s t i tu ted  fo r  the noun phrase 'which t rucks ' .  
The resu l t ing  DEEP express ion  i s  t rans formed by 
the inverse  normal i za t ion  process in to  a SURF 
express ion .  In o rder  to verba l i ze  extended 
responses in a manner both in fo rmat ive  and conc ise  
as poss ib le ,  the e l l ips i s  generat ion  process 
e l ides  those par ts  o f  the semantic representat ion  
o f  complete responses that  are ident ica l  to the 
s tored  representat ion  of  the quest ion  \ [ ? \ ] .  
The verba l i za t ion  component produces a s t r ing  o f  
canon ica l  words and the i r  grammat ica l  features  
using t rans lat ion ru les  attached to the var ious 
categor ies of SURF expressions,  A special  subcom- 
ponent prov ides  for the generat ion  of noun phrases 
as descr ip t ions  o f  domain ind iv idua ls ,  in  our 
example TRUCK2. In this case the NP-generator  
decides not to generate a def in i te  description 
since neither the system nor the user has a l ready  
re fer red  to TRUCK2 in the prev ious  dialog and the 
ex is tence  of  TRUCK2 as a moving ob3ect i s  not 
imp l ied  by the ex is tent ia l  assumptions supp l ied  by 
the a pr io r i  user model (c f .  \ [ ? \ ] ) .  Ins tead ,  the 
indef in i te  NP a l ight -co lo red  t ruck '  i s  gen- 
e ra ted ,  using the proper ty  ' l i ght -co lo red '  as an 
in i t ia l  character i za t ion .  
F ina l ly  the "sur face  t rans format ion '  component \ [1\ ]  
p ronomina l i zes  the noun ' t ruck '  and y ie lds  a 
standard word order  o f  the u t terance  and the 
cor rect ly  in f lec ted  forms o f  the canon ica l  words.  
5. CONCLUSZON 
We have attempted to show that case ro le  f i l l i ng  
fo r  the const ruct ion  of  an unmarked extended 
response can be regarded as a s ide e f fec t  o f  the 
v i sua l  search necessary to answer quest ions  re fer -
