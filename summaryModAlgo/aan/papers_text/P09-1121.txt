Abstract
Web search quality can vary widely across
languages, even for the same information
need. We propose to exploit this variation
in quality by learning a ranking function
on bilingual queries: queries that appear in
query logs for two languages but represent
equivalent search interests. For a given
bilingual query, along with correspond-
ing monolingual query log and monolin-
gual ranking, we generate a ranking on
pairs of documents, one from each lan-
guage. Then we learn a linear ranking
function which exploits bilingual features
on pairs of documents, as well as standard
monolingual features. Finally, we show
how to reconstruct monolingual ranking
from a learned bilingual ranking. Us-
ing publicly available Chinese and English
query logs, we demonstrate for both lan-
guages that our ranking technique exploit-
ing bilingual data leads to significant im-
provements over a state-of-the-art mono-
lingual ranking algorithm.
1 Introduction
Web search quality can vary widely across lan-
guages, even for a single query and search en-
gine. For example, we might expect that rank-
ing search results for the query Wj? ?Y?
(Thomas Hobbes) to be more difficult in Chinese
than it is in English, even while holding the ba-
sic ranking function constant. At the same time,
ranking search results for the query Han Feizi (8
:) is likely to be harder in English than in Chi-
nese. A large portion of web queries have such
properties that they are originated in a language
different from the one they are searched.
This variance in problem difficulty across lan-
guages is not unique to web search; it appears in
a wide range of natural language processing prob-
lems. Much recent work on bilingual data has fo-
cused on exploiting these variations in difficulty
to improve a variety of monolingual tasks, includ-
ing parsing (Hwa et al, 2005; Smith and Smith,
2004; Burkett and Klein, 2008; Snyder and Barzi-
lay, 2008), named entity recognition (Chang et al,
2009), and topic clustering (Wu and Oard, 2008).
In this work, we exploit a similar intuition to im-
prove monolingual web search.
Our problem setting differs from cross-lingual
web search, where the goal is to return machine-
translated results from one language in response to
a query from another (Lavrenko et al, 2002). We
operate under the assumption that for many mono-
lingual English queries (e.g., Han Feizi), there ex-
ist good documents in English. If we have Chinese
information as well, we can exploit it to help find
these documents. As we will see, machine trans-
lation can provide important predictive informa-
tion in our setting, but we do not wish to display
machine-translated output to the user.
We approach our problem by learning a rank-
ing function for bilingual queries ? queries that
are easily translated (e.g., with machine transla-
tion) and appear in the query logs of two languages
(e.g., English and Chinese). Given query logs
in both languages, we identify bilingual queries
with sufficient clickthrough statistics in both sides.
Large-scale aggregated clickthrough data were
proved useful and effective in learning ranking
functions (Dou et al, 2008). Using these statis-
tics, we can construct a ranking over pairs of docu-
ments, one from each language. We use this rank-
ing to learn a linear scoring function on pairs of
documents given a bilingual query.
We find that our bilingual rankings have good
monolingual ranking properties. In particular,
given an optimal pairwise bilingual ranking, we
show that simple heuristics can effectively approx-
imate the optimal monolingual ranking. Using

these heuristics and our learned pairwise scoring
function, we can derive a ranking for new, unseen
bilingual queries. We develop and test our bilin-
gual ranker on English and Chinese with two large,
publicly available query logs from the AOL search
engine1 (English query log) (Pass et al, 2006)
and the Sougou search engine2 (Chinese query
log) (Liu et al, 2007). For both languages, we
achieve significant improvements over monolin-
gual Ranking SVM (RSVM) baselines (Herbrich
et al, 2000; Joachims, 2002), which exploit a va-
riety of monolingual features.
2 Bilingual Query Statistics
We designate a query as bilingual if the concept
has been searched by users of both two languages.
As a result, not only does it occur in the query log
of its own language, but its translation also appears
in the log of the second language. So a bilingual
query yields reasonable queries in both languages.
Of course, most queries are not bilingual. For ex-
ample, our English log contains map of Alabama,
but not our Chinese log. In this case, we wouldn?t
expect the Chinese results for the query?s transla-
tion, ?n?j?C, to be helpful in ranking the
English results.
In total, we extracted 4.8 million English
queries from AOL log, of which 1.3% of their
translations appear in Sogou log. Similarly, of our
3.1 million Chinese queries from Sogou log, 2.3%
of their translations appear in AOL log. By to-
tal number of queries issued (i.e., counting dupli-
1http://search.aol.com
2http://www.sogou.com
cates), the proportion of bilingual queries is much
higher. As Figure 1 shows as the number of times
a query is issued increases, so does the chance of
it being bilingual. In particular, nearly 45% of the
highest-frequency English queries and 35% of the
highest-frequency Chinese queries are bilingual.
3 Learning to Rank Using Bilingual
Information
Given a set of bilingual queries, we now de-
scribe how to learn a ranking function for mono-
lingual data that exploits information from both
languages. Our procedure has three steps: Given
two monolingual rankings, we construct a bilin-
gual ranking on pairs of documents, one from each
language. Then we learn a linear scoring function
for pairs of documents that exploits monolingual
information (in both languages) and bilingual in-
formation. Finally, given this ranking function on
pairs and a new bilingual query, we reconstruct a
monolingual ranking for the language of interest.
This section addresses these steps in turn.
3.1 Creating Bilingual Training Data
Without loss of generality, suppose we rank En-
glish documents with constraints from Chinese
documents. Given an English log Le and a Chi-
nese log Lc, our ranking algorithm takes as input
a bilingual query pair q = (qe, qc) where qe ? Le
and qc ? Lc, a set of returned English documents
{ei}Ni=1 from qe, and a set of constraint Chinese
documents {cj}nj=1 from qc. In order to create
bilingual ranking data, we first generate monolin-
gual ranking data from clickthrough statistics. For
each language-query-document triple, we calcu-
late the aggregated click count across all users and
rank documents according to this statistic. We de-
note the count of a page as C(ei) or C(cj).
The use of clickthrough statistics as feedback
for learning ranking functions is not without con-
troversy, but recent empirical results on large
data sets suggest that the aggregated user clicks
provides an informative indicator of relevance
preference for a query. Joachims et al (2007)
showed that relative feedback signals generated
from clicks correspond well with human judg-
ments. Dou et al (2008) revealed that a straight-
forward use of aggregated clicks can achieve a bet-
ter ranking than using explicitly labeled data be-
cause clickthrough data contain fine-grained dif-
ferences between documents useful for learning an

accurate and reliable ranking. Therefore, we lever-
age aggregated clicks for comparing the relevance
order of documents. Note that there is nothing
specific to our technique that requires clickthrough
statistics. Indeed, our methods could easily be em-
ployed with human annotated data. Table 1 gives
an example of a bilingual query pair and the ag-
gregated click count of each result page.
Given two monolingual documents, a prefer-
ence order can be inferred if one document is
clicked more often than another. To allow for
cross-lingual information, we extend the order of
individual documents into that of bilingual docu-
ment pairs: given two bilingual document pairs,
we will write
(
e(1)i , c
(1)
j
)

(
e(2)i , c
(2)
j
)
to indi-
cate that the pair of
(
e(1)i , c
(1)
j
)
is ranked higher
than the pair of
(
e(2)i , c
(2)
j
)
.
Definition 1
(
e(1)i , c
(1)
j
)

(
e(2)i , c

)
if and
only if one of the following relations hold:
1. C(e(1)i ) > C(e
(2)
i ) and C(c
(1)
j ) ? C(c
(2)
j )
2. C(e(1)i ) ? C(e
(2)
i ) and C(c
(1)
j ) > C(c
(2)
j )
Note, however, that from a purely monolingual
perspective, this definition introduces orderings on
documents that should not initially have existed.
For English ranking, for example, we may have(
e(1)i , c
(1)
j
)

(
e(2)i , c
(2)
j
)
even when C(e(1)i ) =
C(e(2)i ). This leads us to the following asymmet-
ric definition of  that we use in practice:
Definition 2
(
e(1)i , c
(1)
j
)

(
e(2)i , c
(2)
j
)
if and
only if C(e(1)i ) > C(e
(2)
i ) and C(c
(1)
j ) ? C(c
(2)
j )
With this definition, we can unambiguously
compare the relevance of bilingual document pairs
based on the order of monolingual documents.
The advantages are two-fold: (1) we can treat mul-
tiple cross-lingual document similarities the same
way as the commonly used query-document fea-
tures in a uniform manner of learning; (2) with the
similarities, the relevance estimation on bilingual
document pairs can be enhanced, and this in return
can improve the ranking of documents.
3.2 Ranking Model
Given a pair of bilingual queries (qe, qc), we
can extract the set of corresponding bilin-
gual document pairs and their click counts
{(ei, cj), (C(ei), C(cj))}, where i = 1, . . . , N
and j = 1, . . . , n. Based on that, we produce a
set of bilingual ranking instances S = {?ij, zij},
where each ?ij = {xi;yj; sij} is the feature
vector of (ei, cj) consisting of three components:
xi = f(qe, ei) is the vector of monolingual rele-
vancy features of ei, yi = f(qc, cj) is the vector
of monolingual relevancy features of cj , and sij =
sim(ei, cj) is the vector of cross-lingual similari-
ties between ei and cj , and zij = (C(ei), C(cj))
is the corresponding click counts.
The task is to select the optimal function that
minimizes a given loss with respect to the order
of ranked bilingual document pairs and the gold.
We resort to Ranking SVM (RSVM) (Herbrich et
al., 2000; Joachims, 2002) learning for classifica-
tion on pairs of instances. Compared the base-
line RSVM (monolingual), our algorithm learns
to classify on pairs of bilingual document pairs
rather than on pairs of individual documents.
Let f being a linear function:
f~w(ei, cj) = ~wx ? xi + ~wy ? yj + ~ws ? sij (1)
where ~w = {~wx; ~wy; ~ws} denotes the weight vec-
tor, in which the elements correspond to the rele-
vancy features and similarities. For any two bilin-
gual document pairs, their preference relation is
measured by the difference of the functional val-
ues of Equation 1:

We then create a new training corpus based on the

There are potentially ? = nN bilingual docu-
ment pairs for each query, and the number of com-
parable pairs may be much larger due to the com-
binatorial nature (but less than ?(? ? 1)/2). To
speed up training, we resort to stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) optimizer (Shalev-Shwartz et al,
2007) to approximate the true gradient of the loss
function evaluated on a single instance (i.e., per
constraint). The parameters are then adjusted by
an amount proportional to this approximate gradi-
ent. For large data set, SGD-RSVM can be much
faster than batch-mode gradient descent.
3.3 Inference
The solution ~w forms a vector orthogonal to the
hyper-plane of RSVM. To predict the order of
bilingual document pairs, the ranking score can
be simply calculated by Equation 1. However, a
prominent problem is how to derive the full order
of monolingual documents for output from the or-
der of bilingual document pairs. To our knowl-
edge, there is no precise conversion algorithm in
polynomial time. We thus adopt two heuristics for
approximating the true document score:
? H-1 (max score): Choose the maximum
score of the pair as the score of document,
i.e., score(ei) = maxj(f(ei, cj)).
? H-2 (mean score): Average over all the
scores of pairs associated with the ranked
document as the score of this document, i.e.,
score(ei) = 1/n
?
j f(ei, cj).
Intuitively, for the rank score of a single docu-
ment, H-2 combines the ?voting? scores from its n
constraint documents weighted equally, while H-1
simply chooses the maximum one. A formal ap-
proach to the problem is to leverage rank aggre-
gation formalism (Dwork et a., 2001; Liu et al,
2007), which will be left for our future work. The
two simple heuristics are employed here because
of their simplicity and efficiency. The time com-
plexity of the approximation is linear to the num-
ber of ranked documents given n is constant.
4 Features and Similarities
Standard features for learning to rank include vari-
ous query-document features, e.g., BM25 (Robert-
son, 1997), as well as query-independent features,
e.g., PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998). Our feature
space consists of both these standard monolingual
features and cross-lingual similarities among doc-
uments. The cross-lingual similarities are valu-
ated using different translation mechanisms, e.g.,
dictionary-based translation or machine transla-
tion, or even without any translation at all.
4.1 Monolingual Relevancy Features
In learning to rank, the relevancy between query
and documents and the measures based on link
analysis are commonly used as features. The dis-
cussion on their details is beyond the scope of this
paper. Readers may refer to (Liu et al, 2007)
for the definitions of many such features. We im-
plement six of these features that are considered
the most typical shown as Table 2. These include
sets of measures such as BM25, language-model-
based IR score, and PageRank. Because most con-
ventional IR and web search relevancy measures
fall into this category, we call them altogether IR
features in what follows. Note that for a given
bilingual document pair (e, c), the monolingual IR
features consist of relevance score vectors f(qe, e)
in English and f(qc, c) in Chinese.
4.2 Cross-lingual Document Similarities
To measure the document similarity across dif-
ferent languages, we define the similarity vector
sim(e, c) as a series of functions mapping a bilin-
gual document pair to positive real numbers. In-
tuitively, a good similarity function is one which
maps cross-lingual relevant documents into close
scores and maintains a large distance between ir-
relevant and relevant documents. Four categories
of similarity measures are employed.
Dictionary-based Similarity (DIC): For
dictionary-based document translation, we use

used as IR features in our model.

PageRank PageRank score (Brin and Page, 1998)
the similarity measure proposed by Mathieu et
al. (2004). Given a bilingual dictionary, we let
T (e, c) denote the set of word pairs (we, wc) such
that we is a word in English document e, and wc
is a word in Chinese document c, and we is the
English translation of wc. We define tf(we, e)
and tf(wc, c) to be the term frequency of we in
e and that of wc in c, respectively. Let df(we)
and df(wc) be the English document frequency
for we and Chinese document frequency for
wc. If ne (nc) is the total number of English
(Chinese), then the bilingual idf is defined as
idf(we, wc) = log ne+ncdf(we)+df(wc) . Then the
cross-lingual document similarity is calculated by
sim(e, c) =
?
(we,wc)?T (e,c)
tf(we,e)tf(wc,c)idf(we,wc)2
?
Z
where Z is a normalization coefficient (see Math-
ieu et al (2004) for detail). This similarity func-
tion can be understood as the cross-lingual coun-
terpart of the monolingual cosine similarity func-
tion (Salton, 1998).
Similarity Based on Machine Translation
(MT): For machine translation, the cross-lingual
measure actually becomes a monolingual similar-
ity between one document and another?s transla-
tion. We therefore adopt cosine function for it di-
rectly (Salton, 1998).
Translation Ratio (RATIO): Translation ratio
is defined as two sets of ratios of translatable terms
using a bilingual dictionary: RATIO FOR ? what
percent of words in e can be translated to words in
c; RATIO BACK ? what percent of words in c can
be translated back to words in e.
URL LCS Ratio (URL): The ratio of longest
common subsequence (Cormen et al, 2001) be-
tween the URLs of two pages being compared.
This measure is useful to capture pages in different
languages but with similar URLs such as www.
airbus.com, www.airbus.com.cn, etc.
Note that each set of similarities above except
URL includes 3 values based on different fields of
web page: title, body, and title+body.
5 Experiments and Results
This section presents evaluation metric, data sets
and experiments for our proposed ranker.
5.1 Evaluation Metric
Commonly adopted metrics for ranking, such as
mean average precision (Buckley and Voorhees,
2000) and Normalized Discounted Cumulative
Gain (Ja?rvelin and Keka?la?inen, 2000), is designed
for data sets with human relevance judgment,
which is not available to us. Therefore, we
use the Kendall?s tau coefficient (Kendall, 1938;
Joachims, 2002) to measure the degree of correla-
tion between two rankings. For simplicity, let?s as-
sume strict orderings of any given ranking. There-
fore we ignore all the pairs with ties (instances
with the identical click count). Kendall?s tau is
defined as ?(ra, rb) = (P ? Q)/(P + Q), where
P is the number of concordant pairs and Q is the
number of disconcordant pairs in the given order-
ings ra and rb. The value is a real number within
[?1,+1], where ?1 indicates a complete inver-
sion, and +1 stands for perfect agreement, and a
value of zero indicates no correlation.
Existing ranking techniques heavily depend on
human relevance judgment that is very costly to
obtain. Similar to Dou et al(2008), our method
utilizes the automatically aggregated click count in
query logs as the gold for deriving the true order
of relevancy, but we use the clickthrough of dif-
ferent languages. We average Kendall?s tau values
between the algorithm output and the gold based
on click frequency for all test queries.
5.2 Data Sets
Query logs can be the basis for constructing high
quality ranking corpus. Due to the proprietary
issue of log, no public ranking corpus based on
real-world search engine log is currently avail-
able. Moreover, to build a predictable bilingual
ranking corpus, the logs of different languages are
needed and have to meet certain conditions: (1)
they should be sufficiently large so that a good
number of bilingual query pairs could be identi-
1079

fied; (2) for the identified query pairs, there should
be sufficient statistics of associated clickthrough
data; (3) The click frequency should be well dis-
tributed at both sides so that the preference order
between bilingual document pairs can be derived
for SVM learning.
For these reasons, we use two independent and
publicly accessible query logs to construct our
bilingual ranking corpus: English AOL log3 and
Chinese Sogou log4. Table 3 shows some statis-
tics of these two large query logs.
We automatically identify 10,544 bilingual
query pairs from the two logs using the Java
API for Google Translate5, in which each query
has certain number of clicked URLs. To bet-
ter control the bilingual equivalency of queries,
we make sure the bilingual queries in each of
these pairs are bi-directional translations. Then
we download all their clicked pages, which re-
sults in 70,180 English6 and 111,197 Chinese doc-
uments. These documents form two independent
collections, which are indexed separately for re-
trieval and feature calculation.
For good quality, it is necessary to have suffi-
cient clickthrough data for each query. So we fur-
ther identify 1,084 out of 10,544 bilingual query
pairs, in which each query has at least 10 clicked
and downloadable documents. This smaller col-
lection is used for learning our model, which con-
tains 21,711 English and 28,578 Chinese docu-
ments7. In order to compute cross-lingual doc-
ument similarities based on machine translation

6AOL log only records the domain portion of the clicked
URLs, which misleads document downloading. We use the
?search within site or domain? function of a major search en-
gine to approximate the real clicked URLs by keeping the
first returned result for each query.
7Because Sogou log has a lot more clicked URLs, for bal-
ancing with the number of English pages, we kept at most 50
pages per Chinese query.

(see Section 4.2), we automatically translate all
these 50,298 documents using Google Translate,
i.e., English to Chinese and vice versa. Then the
bilingual document pairs are constructed, and all
the monolingual features and cross-lingual simi-
larities are computed (see Section 4.1&4.2).
5.3 English Ranking Performance
Here we examine the ranking performance of our
English ranker under different similarity settings.
We use traditional RSVM (Herbrich et al, 2000;
Joachims, 2002) without any bilingual considera-
tion as the baseline, which uses only English IR
features. We conduct this experiment using all the
1,084 bilingual query pairs with 4-fold cross vali-
dation (each fold with 271 query pairs). The num-
ber of constraint documents n is empirically set as
5. The results are shown in Table 4.
Clearly, bilingual constraints are helpful to
improve English ranking. Our pairwise set-
tings unanimously outperforms the RSVM base-
line. The paired two-tailed t-test (Smucker et
al., 2007) shows that most improvements resulted
from heuristic H-2 (mean score) are statistically
significant at 99% confidence level (p<0.01). Rel-
atively fewer significant improvements can be
made by heuristic H-1 (max score). This is be-
cause the maximum score on pair is just a rough
approximation to the optimal document score. But
this simple scheme works surprisingly well and
still consistently outperforms the baseline.
Note that our bilingual model with only IR fea-
tures, i.e., IR (no similarity), also outperforms the
baseline. The reason is that in this setting there are

The DIC similarity does not work as effectively
as MT. This may be due to the limitation of bilin-
gual dictionary alone for translating documents,
where the issues like out-of-vocabulary words and
translation ambiguity are common but can be bet-
ter dealt with by MT. When DIC is combined with
RATIO, which considers both forward and back-
ward translation of words, it can capture the corre-
lation between bilingually very similar pages, thus
performs better.
We find that the URL similarity, although sim-
ple, is very useful and improves 1.5?2.4% of
Kendall?s tau value than not using it. This is be-
cause the URLs of the top Chinese (constraint)
documents are often similar to many of returned
English URLs which are generally more regu-
lar. For example, in query pair (Toyota Camry,
T?), 9/13 English pages are anchored by
the URLs containing keywords ?toyota? and/or
?camry?, and 3/5 constraint documents? URLs
also contain them. In contrast, the URLs of re-
turned Chinese pages are less regular in general.
This also explains why this measure does not im-
prove much for Chinese ranking (see Section 5.4).
We also vary the parameter n to study how
the performance changes with different number of
constraint Chinese documents. Figure 2 shows the
results using heuristic H-2. More constraint doc-
uments are generally helpful, but when only one
constraint document is used, it may be detrimen-

tal to the ranking for some features. One explana-
tion is that the document clicked most often is not
necessarily relevant, and it is very likely that no
English page is similar to the first Chinese page.
Joachims et al (2007) found that users? click be-
havior is biased by the rank of search engine at
the first and/or second positions (especially the
first). More constraint pages are helpful because
the pages after the first are less biased and the click
counts can reflect the relevancy more accurately.
5.4 Chinese Ranking Performance
We also benchmark Chinese ranking with English
constraint documents under the similar configura-
tions as Section 5.3. The results are given by Ta-
ble 5 and Figure 3.
As shown in Table 5, improvements on Chinese
ranking are even more encouraging. Kendall?s tau
values under all the settings are significantly better
than not only the baseline but also IR (no similar-
ity). This may suggest that English information is
generally more helpful to Chinese ranking than the
other way round. The reason is straightforward:
there are a high proportion of Chinese queries hav-
ing English or foreign-language origins in our data
set. For these queries, relevant information at Chi-
nese side may be relatively poorer, so the English
ranking can be more reliable. As far as we can, we
manually identified 215 such queries from all the
1,084 bilingual queries (amount to 23.2%).
To shed more light on this finding, we exam-
ine top-20 queries improved most by our method

(with all features and similarities) over the base-
line. As shown in Table 6, most of the top im-
proved Chinese queries are about concepts origi-
nated from English or other languages, or some-
thing non-local (bolded). Interestingly, u?{
? (political catoons) are among these Chinese
queries improved most by English ranking, which
is believed as rare (or sensitive) content on Chi-
nese web. In contrast, top English queries are short
of this type of queries. But we can still see Bruce
Lee (?B), a Chinese Kung-Fu actor, and pe-
ony (?[), the national flower of China. Their
information tends to be more popular on Chinese
web, and thus helpful to English ranking. For the
exceptions like Sunrider (?y) and Aniston
(???), despite their English origins, we find
they have surprisingly sparse click counts in En-
glish log while Chinese users look much more in-
terested and provide a lot of clickthrough that is
helpful.
6 Conclusions and Future Work
We aim to improve web search ranking for an
important set of queries, called bilingual queries,
by exploiting bilingual information derived from
clickthrough logs of different languages. The
thrust of our technique is using search ranking
of one language and cross-lingual information to
help ranking of another language. Our pairwise
ranking scheme based on bilingual document pairs
can easily integrate all kinds of similarities into
the existing framework and significantly improves
both English and Chinese ranking performance.

Our model can be generally applied to other
search ranking problems, such as ranking us-
ing monolingual similarities or ranking for cross-
lingual/multilingual web search. Another interest-
ing direction is to study the recovery of the optimal
document ordering from pairwise ordering using
well-founded formalism such as rank aggregation
approaches (Dwork et a., 2001; Liu et al, 2007).
Furthermore, we may involve more sophisti-
cated monolingual features that do not transfer
cross-lingually but are asymmetric for either side,
such as clustering, document classification fea-
tures built from domain taxonomies like DMOZ.
