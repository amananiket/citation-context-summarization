This is the golden promise. The state of computer alchemy, how- 
ever, is such that one can profitably examine what has been done with 
computers as aids in the study of Amer ican  English dialects. 
Purpose . 
This paper will sketch the development of computer procedures 
which have been used in the analysis of regional Amer ican  English 
outside of literary contexts, It will note that lists of words and phra- 
ses have grown in complexity of count, and that some larger units 
of spoken sentences are being described . Having shown what has been 
done, it will suggest additional uses of the computer in preparing 
clearer displays of local variations in usage.

Collecting techniques. 
If dialectology, defined broadly, is the collection and analysis 
of natural speech in a cornrnunity, then Amer ican  dialectology has 
gone about this endeavor is three or more  ways.  One  is to conduct 
a controlled interview during which the investigator, guided by en- 
tries on worksheets,  asks questions and writes the informant's re- 
plies in a phonetic script. 3 A second, based on data collected by the 
first procedure,  is to give an informant a printed questionnaire and 
ask  h im to encircle those words  which he actual~y uses and to leave 
unmarked  those which  are foreign to his habits. A third, seeking to 
obtain only pronunciation, asks the informant to read a set passage 
aloud in his normal  speaking voice~ 5 And  the last one to be named 
asks a speaker to look at a set of numbered  pictures and to say some-  
thing about them;  his remarks  are recorded by means  of a tape re- 
corder and are transcribed later .6, 7 
Anal____.ysis and  pub l i ca t ion .  
The  mid - twent ie th  century  marks  a tu rn ing  po int  in the sor t ing  
and  pub l i ca t ion  of data  about  spoken  Amer ican  Eng l i sh .  Manua l  work  
was  requ i red  in the ent i re  p reparat ion  of a 1949 s tudy  of the vocabu-  
la ry  of the At lant i c  communi t ies  and  of a para l le l  s tudy  of p ronunc ia -  
t ion  there  - -  the la t te r  pub l i shed  in 1961. B, 9 Between those  dates  
Atwood in Texas  and  Wood in  Tennessee  had  begun to punch  the i r  l i n -  
gu is t i c  data  on  cards  for  la te r  mach ine  sor t ing ,  count ing ,  and  pub-  
l i ca t ion .  10, 11 Compar i sons  of the tab les  in Kurath  (1949) with those  
in Atwood (196Z)  wi l l  show that  whi le  both  works  l i s t  a common re -  
g iona l  vocabu lary ,  the Atwood s tudy  shows  an inc rease  in the prec i -  
s ion  of measurements  of occurrence.  These  calculations and the mul -  
tiplicity of tables showing gradation in word  choice among age groups 
are a reflection of Atwood 's  use of computers .  
P rob lems in transcription. 
If the researcher  employs  a printed questionnaire, he has no dif- 
ficulty in converting those words  chosen and conventionally spelled 
into acceptable punched entries which will emerge  in the same spell- 
ing in a printout. But  if he has made a phonetic transcription or if he 
has a tape recording as his basic doqurnent, then he faces a variety 
of p rob lems in preparing the document  for computer  analysis. Whi le 
science fiction , reversing the computer  processes which generate 
artifi~zial speech, imagines a computer  that can read a voice tape , 
transcribe it into its proper  regional representation, and compare  it 
with tapes f rom other dialects, fact requires linguistic researchers

to t ranscr ibe  the  documents  w i th in  the  l im i ts  of  key  punch  conven-  
t ions  o r  o ther  res t r i c t ions  that  app ly .  
Le t  us  cons ider  the  prob lems o f  a researcher  who  i s  us ing  as  
bas ic  documents  a g roup  of  tape  record ings  wh ich  have  comparab le  
un i t s  of  d i scuss ion  s to red  on  them:  1Z Convent iona l  Eng l i sh  spe l l ing  
presents  no  prob lem.  The  upper  case  Roman a lphabet  of  computer  
p r in touts  serves  a l l  o f  h i s  needs :  ca t  w i l l  be punched and  pr in ted  
CAT.  But  he  w i l l  need  to a l te r  the  bas ic  ev idence  in  cer ta in  ways  
s ince  he  w i l l  re turn  to the  natura l  pat te rn  in  a d i f fe rent  cod ing .  He 
w i l l  normal i ze  a l l  p ronunc ia t ions  o? a word  in to  the  convent iona l  
spe l l ing .  If ,  fo r  ins tance ,  some in fo rmants  say  / r /  and o thers  d rop  
i t ,  he  w i l l  spe l l  i t  regu la r ly :  l aw + Jr~ and law appear  as  LAW;  car  
and  mi r ro r  - /r\] appear  as  CAR and  MIRROR.  And  he  w i l l  want  to 
cons ider  mark ing  d i s t inc t ions  when wr i t ten  convent ions  use  one  s ign  
fo r  two funct ions :  Tom's  here  ( cont rac t ing  i s  ) and  Tom's  ha i r  ( in -  
d ica t ing  possess ion  ) might  be d i s t ingu ished  f rom each  o ther  in  th i s  
way:  TOM/S  HERE and  TOM*S HAIR .  As  th i s  aud ience  knows  a l l  
too  we l l ,  such  normal i z ings  he lp  when one  comes  to sor t ing  a body  
of  ev idence  a lphabet ica l l y  by  computer .  
The  pronunc ia t ion  text  has  to be prepared  separate ly ,  a second 
t ranscr ip t ion  of  the  amount  of  spoken  deta i l  that  the  researcher  wants  
to code  and  ana lyze .  Whether  he  i s  t ranscr ib ing  Eng l i sh  o r  some 
other  language,  he  has  to come to gr ips  w i th  the  d i f fe rences  between 
the  Roman a lphabet  and  the  In ternat iona l  Phonet ic  A lphabet  wh ich  
serves  most  of  us  fo r  phonet ic  t ranscr ip t ions  of  speech .  Some le t -  
te rs  match  we l l  enough.  Phonet ic  \[ b\]  i s  adequate ly  represented  by  
B .  For  o thers  there  i s  no match :  phonet ic  \[ ae\] has  no immedia te  
equ iva lent  in  the  ava i lab le  le t te rs  ; and  l i te ra l  Q has  no l i te ra l  match  
in  IPA .  Thus  i f  the  researcher  has  t ranscr ibed  the  Amer ican  Eng l i sh  
pronunc ia t ion  of  ca t  as  \[ kaet  \] , he  has  K and  T a t  hand  but  must  de -

pa i rs  053303,  to use  a code  that  has  been  employed .  13 Th is  wr i te r  
f inds  a code  l i ke  that  hard  to remember  and  to read ;  h i s  p re ference

Word  geograph ies  o f  Amer ican  reg iona l  Eng l i sh  syntax  have  not

o f  var iant  verb  fo rms  in  the  At lant i c  s ta tes .  14 I t  i s  here ,  then ,  that  
computer  p rocess ing  can  br ing  together  ev idence  about  s t r ings  of  
words  that  w i l l  enab le  d ia lec to log is ts  to compare  s tandard  and  loca l  
pat te rns  o f  sentence  s t ruc ture .  But  le t  us  d i spose  o f  a few other  de -  
ta i l s  of  ed i t ing  the  spoken  text  be fore  we turn  to i t s  ana lys i s .  
It does not seem likely that a g rammar  and syntax of Amer ican  
regional English will emerge  f rom the phonetic evidence. First, a 
part of the evidence is missing -- the supersegmental  part for instance. 
Second, the tedium of preparing and proo/reading the needed amount  
of text presents an almost insuperable barrier. As  a consequence, 
regional English grammar  and syntax will be constructed f rom sen- 
tences conventionally spelled. 
The researcher must  establish word  boundaries and decide on 
the rr~ust suitable grammar .  Let us assume that he has chosen a 
slot and filler grarnlnar on the Fries model.  15 His word  boundaries, 
then, will allow the word  to be put into files in computer  memory  
which correspond to syntactic slots.. That is, the researcher must  
decide what is "one word"  and punch the text accordingly. If the source 
recording has woodpecker  and rail fence, as it does, the decision 
can often go either way. For  computer  purposes it may  be good to 
present each as "one word"  in the fo rm WOODPECKER and R~ILFENCE 
(or if that looks too strange, RA IL -FENCE ). Conversely, it may  be 
more  economical  to present each as't~ro words"  -- WOOD PECKER 
and RA IL  FENCE.  
Discovery procedures. 
Having stored the dialectal evidence in sentences made up of 
strings of conventionally spelled ,words and in segments of phonetic 
transcription, the researcher must  direct the computer  to look for 
details which characterize that dialect and then to apply the same 
search techniques to hitherto unexamined words, phrases, and sen- 
5 
tence  s .  
The  obv ious  f i r s t  s tep  for  Amer ican  d ia lec to logy  is  to search  
computer  memory  fo r  se lec ted  words  wh ich  have  been used  to iden-  
t i fy  the major  d ia lec ts  of  that  language a long  the At lant i c  seaboard .  
I f  one has  used  a pr in ted  quest ionna i re ,  some words  wi l l  be s tored  
in memory  wi th  an  ind icat ion  that  no one chose  them;  if, on the o ther  
hand,  one has  used  a d i rec t  in terv iew procedure ,  he wi l l  have  pro -  
v ided  computer  memory  wi th  no guide to the miss ing  lex icon .  When 
the computer  is  d i rec ted  to fo l low a concor ;dance  or  l i s t ing  program,  
it  w i l l  u l t imate ly  repor t  that  f rom the pr in ted  quest ionna i re  0 persons  
chose  awendaw bread  and some ha l f  dozen  o ther  words ,  10 chose  car  - 
ben  o i l ,  73 chose  doub le  s ing le t ree  ,and  so on Let  us  assume that  
the spoken record had the same numbers  of known choices -- I0 and 
73, but silence for awendaw bread  ; one cannot conclude that awendaw 
bread is either used or unused  among those informants. The  avail- 
able raw evidence, then, helps to shape the mode l  of a linguistic com-  
munity. 
The  tabulated responses to a pictorial interview manua l  may give 
a wider range of local words, hence a different base for the model ,  
than do other techniques. For  the dialectally distinctive faucet and 
spigo____~t, Table 1 provides an illustration of the range of synonyms 
elicited by a picture of a device to control the flow of water. The  com-  
puter counted these according to the county in which  each informant 
was  living . In Table I # 1 stands for counties in east Tennessee  and 
north A labama,  and # Z stands for those in central and south A labama.  
Under  other c i rcumstances this code could stand for young-old, city- 
country, wealthy-poor, or any other pair that was  pertinent,

This mode l  of allophonic variations obviously is a more  com-  
plex structure than is that of synonyms in Table I; thus the compar i -  
son of the geogr~aphic and social boundaries of these two aspects of 
common language habits is difficult. At  the present t ime it is done 
by inspection rather than by computer .  Of course some of the dif- 
ficulty would disappear if the allophones were  coded as phonemes;  
this would  reduce five symbols  to two -- E# and I*. For  a socio- 
linguist or a dialectologist to do so is to lose details that may be of 
great importance later. As  everyone knows, social distinctions are 
attached to such things a~s the presence or absence of /r/, the sepa- 
ration of pen f rom pi___~n, and so on. 
The last stage and the newest  sort of computer  aided research 
in dialectology is in the grammar  and syntax of local sentences. As  
has already been said, computer  research will be directed toward 
conventionally spelled transcriptions of the spoken sentences. And  
the grammat ica l  process itself is essentially one of building a con- 
cDrdanc?. 
The first sentences concorded are those which have in them the 
words  which earlier were  used to identify the local dialects. For  
g rammat ica l  analysis, the whole sentence is much  too long; rather 
one selects the two slots on either side of the cnncorded word  itself, 
The concorded word  is v iewed as a base. Table IIlillustrates con- 
cording with rna____n (synonym of bandit and robbe_~r ) with words in 
numbered  slots with an A or C prefix, i.e. antecedent and complement .  
The coded areas of Tennessee  and A labama are listed at the left.

tab les  der ived  f rom computat ion  d i f fe r  f rom those  in  Kurath  ch ie f ly  
in the  re f inement  o f  measurements  that  accompany  the  word  l i s t s .  
The  re f inements  a re  cer ta in ly  needed,  but  they  do not  re f lec t  a l l  o f  
the  capab i l i t i es  o f  the  mach ine  to man ipu la te  the  data .  
In  s tud ies  that  s re  not  in tended as  d ia lec to logy ,  one  f inds  much 
of  the  same th ing .  The  Jones -Wepman word  count  of  spoken  Eng l i sh  
resembles  on a smal l  sca le  the  Thorndyke-Lorge  word  counts  of  
p r in ted  Eng l i sh  that  were  assembled  severa l  generat ions  ago  w i thout  
the  a id  of  computers .  Perhaps  the  one  d i f fe rence  i s  that  Jones  and  
Weprnan undertook a part-of-speech classification of their data, a 
first step toward a grammar  and syntax of spoken English. Other re- 
lated first steps have been taken toward the construction of slot and 
filler g rammars  of the main  language and a few of its dialects. It 
does not se~rnlikely that transformational-generative grammar  will 
contribute much to solving the analytical difficulties largely because 
that style of g rammar  is interested in the deep and general str~gtures 
rather than the surface grammar  found in dialectal variations. 
As  for applicable computer programs, those that serve in the 
construction of concordances and lists have seemed adequate. In a 
collection of essays on the use of computers in the study of natural 
languages, RogerShuy  discussed in broad terms a ' retrieval p rogram
