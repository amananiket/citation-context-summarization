ABSTRACT 
The REQUEST System is an experimental n a t u r a l  language query 
system based on r. large transfo~ational grammar of English. In 
the original implementation of the system the process of computing 
the underlying sLructures of input queries involved a sequence of 
three steps: (1) preprocessing (including dictionary lookup), 
(2) surface phrase structure parsing, and (3) transformational 
parsing. This scheme has since been modified to permit transfor- 
mational operations not only on the full trees available after com- 
pletion of surface parsing, but also on the strings of lexical 
trees which are the output of the preprocessing phase. Transfor- 
mational rules of this latter type which are invoded prior to sur- 
face parsing, are kno~n as string transformations. 
Since they must be defined in the absence of such structural 
markers as the location of clause boundaries, string transforma- 
tions aye necessarily relatively local in scope. Despite t h i s  in- 
herent limitation, they have so far proved to be an extremely use- 
ful and surprisingly versatile addition t o  the REQUEST System. 
Applications to date have included homograph resolution, analysis 
of classifier constructions, idiom handling, and the suppression of 
large numbers of unwanted surface parses. While by no means a 
panacea for transformational parsing, the use of string transfor- 
mations in REQUEST has permitted relatively rapid and painless ex- 
tension crf the English subset in a number of important areas with- 
out corresponding adverse impact on the size of the lexicon, the 
complexity of.the surface grammar, and the number of surface parses 
produced.

a t  the IBM Thomas  J ,  Watson. Resea rch  Center .  The s y s t e m  includes a

s tyle  semant ic  i n t e r p r e t e r .  The grammar and its a s soc ia t ed  lexicon a r e  
broadly or iented towards  quest ion-answering on periodic numer ica l  da t a ,  
they a l s o  include m a t e r i a l  specif ic  t o  n a t u r a l  English in te rac t ion  with co l -

The long-range objective of the  work on REQUEST is t o  de te rmine  the 
extent  to which ma th ine  -unde rdstandable s u b s e t s  of English can  be developed 
to provide n o n - p r o g r a m m e r s  with a convenient and powerful tool  for  a c c e s s -  
ing informat ion in formatted data b a s e s  without having t o  'Learn a f o r m a l  
query language. In the  i n t e r e s t  of faci l i tat ing effective "under standing" on 
the  part of the sys tem,  the seman t i c  scope of the  English subse t  we a r e

to cover  a re la t ively  broad fange  of syntact ic  and lexical  a l te rna t ives ,  in 
the hope of permit t ing fu tu re  u s e r s  to  employ t h e i r  n o r m a l  pa t te rns  of

including wh- and yes  -no quest ions,  relative c l a u s e s  and c lausa l  negation 
It is now being extended into such areas a s  compar i son ,  conjunction and 
quantification which, while complex, appea r  t o  be of c e n t r a l  l rnportance 
in providing a s e n ~ a n t i c a l l y  powerful subset of English.

effect of the employment of s t r ing  t r ans fo rmat ions  has 
been a substant ia l  reduct ion in the number  of unwanted

where  m o r e  than one  s u r f a c e  p a r s e  is produced. )

3 .  Motivation for  the  Introduction of Str ing Transfornla t ions  
Within the s e r i e s  of ma jo r  process ing  s teps  desc r ibed  in the preceding 
section, the application of s t r ing  t r a n s f o r ~ n a t i o n s  o c c u r s  a t  a  point midway 
between preprocess ing  (including lex ica l  lookup) and su r face  phrase  s t ruc  - 
t u r e  parsing. Taken in sequence, t h e s e  t h r e e  s t eps  have the  cumulative 
effect of shifting the locus of ana lys i s  opexations f r o m  the dolnain of w o r d  
s t r ings  to tha t  of full  sentence t r e e s ,  where  conventional t ransfor~mat ions  
(and t h e i r  i n v e r s e s )  can meaningfully be invoked. Unlike the balance of 
the t ransformat iona l  parsing p rocess ,  t hese  t h r e e  pre l iminary  s t eps  do not 
s e e m  to  b e a r  a, d i r e c t  cor respondence  t o  f ami l i a r  generat ive  operat ions .  
Never theless ,  t h e i r  combined effect  i s  to  produce the  t r e e  o r  t r e e s  which 
ex is t  a t  that  s tage of the "farward" generat ion w h e r e  the  l a s t  postcyclic 
t ransformat ion  h a s  applied. Accordingly, it s e e m s  reasonable  t o  view 
them initially as  constituting a kind of "bootstrap" whose function i s  to s e t  
the s tage for '- 'true1' t ransformat iona l  parsing.  
P r i o r  to the introduction of s t r i n g  t r ans fo rmat ions  in the REQUEST 
System, the entire burden of the "bootstrap ' ' -  ro le  just outli'ned necessa r i ly  
fel l  on the p r e p r o c e s s o r  and the s u r f a c e  p a r s e r .  lMoreover, as  wi l l  be 
espla ined below, c e r t a i n  bas i c  p r inc ip l e s  conce rn ing  the n a t u r e  of t he  
s y s t e m ' s  t r a n s f o r m a t i o n a l  component  - -  r e l a t i ng  t o  the r a n g e  of inputs

ensur ing  t h a t  t he  burden  would b e  a l a r g e  one. The  full  d imens ions  of the

In the  e a r l y  des ign  phases of what subsequently b e c a m e  the  REQUEST 
S y s t e m ' s  t r ans fo rma t iona l  g r a m m a r ,  it was decided to adopt  a level  of 
underlying s t r u c t u r e  cons ide rab ly  m o r e  a b s t r a c t  than the  deep  s t r u c t h r e  
of C h o m s k y ' s  Aspects  [7] - - a l eve l  which, somewhat  in the  s p i r i t  of gen-  
e r a t i v e  s e m a n t i c s  18. 91, would go a  long way towards  d i r e c t  r e p r e s e n t a -

One major impact  which th is  view of underlying s t r u c t u r e  had on what  
the "bootstrap" had t o  accomplish involved the  connection of pepos i t iona l  
phrases to  the  balance of the surface s t r u c t u r e  t r e e .  In under ly ing  s t r u c -  
ture, the noun phrase corresponding to each su r face  preposit ional  phrase 
would appear a s  a s p ~ c i f i c  a rgument  in  a specific proposition, follawing.

be explicitly linked to the c lause  o r  c l ausa l  r emnan t  de r ived  from that  un- 
derlying proposition. Thus, in order t o  make  possible a c o r r e c t  inve r se  
t ransfermat iona l  derivation, the su r face  p a r s e r  would have to  make  a l l  
snch linkages explicit. This r equ i remen t  r ep resen ted  a significant depar -

of connecting preposit ional  ph rases  to  the c o r r e c t  l eve l  of s t ruc tu re  was 
simply ducked  by making an  a r b i t r a r y  linkage to  the  n e a r e s t  available

hope was that any additional su r face  p a r s e s  which resu l ted  f r o m  this ap-

3 .  2 Ear ly  Experience with the Parser 
Starting in  late 1971, t e s t s  began on an  inve r se  t r a n s f o r n l a t ~ o n a l  
g r a m m a r  whose generat ive counterpar t  had been developed with the aid of 
Joyce F r i e d m a n ' s  t ransformat iona l  g r a m m a r  t e s t e r  [14] . In the in t e res t  
of debugging the s y s t e m  with as  few .unnecessary con~p l i ca t ions  a s  possible,  
the ini t ial  examples  were "spoon fed" to the p a r s e r  using a minimal  lexicon 
and su r face  g r a m m a r .  While revealing no c r i t i c a l  p roblems with the boot- 
s t rap ,  these first trial runs  indicated that  incor rec t  sur face  s t r u c t u r e s  
w e r e  indeed produced along with the  c o r r e c t  ones and tended to  give r i s e  
to ana lys i s  paths which continued fo r  some t ime before  being abor ted by 
well-fornledness t e s t s .  Sentences with ambiguous v e r b  f o r m s  w e r e  a case 
in point. Thus, i n  the  question "What companies  a r e  computers  made  by? ' I  
the s u r f a c e  p a r s e r  produced two a l m o s t  identical  s t r u c t u r e s  - -  the  first 
with "made" taken a s e a  finite verb in  the  past  t ense ,  the second with it 
taken (co r rec t ly )  as  a past  part iciple.  T.he first ana lys i s  initiated a lengthy 
inve r se  derivation tha t  was t e rmina ted  a s  i l l - formed only a f t e r  t h e  e n t i r e  
postsycle and the first inve r se  cycle  had been t r a v e r s e d ,  meaning that 
near ly  a s  much time was spent in pursuing this  i n c o r r e c t  path as was re-  
quired t o  follow the c o r r e c t  one. In th i s  and a number  of s i m i l a r  c a s e s ,  
however,  it was observed  that i l l - formedness  of the su r face  s t r u c t u r e  
could have readily been detected a t  02 n e a r  the outset  of the t r ans fo rma-  
t ional  parsing p r o c e s s  by performing t e s t g  employing the pattern-matchin 
power of t ransformat iona l  rules .  This  observation led to  the introduction 
of so-called blocking rules in the t ransformat iona l  g r a m m a r ,  rules which 
proved to  be quite effective in detecting and f i l ter ing out i l l - fo rmed  s t r u c -

In the l a t t e r  a r e a ,  it was  d i scovered  (not s u r p r i s i n g l y )  that  d i f fe rences

mapped onto a s e t  of only 9 nodes f o r  purposes  of t ransformat iona l  parsing.  
3 . 3  Prob lems  of Growth of Coverage 
The var ious  m e a s u r e s  just  descr ibed  had the effect of stabilizing the 
incidence of a r t i f ic ia l  su r face  s t r u c t u r e  ambiguit ies a t  a to lerably  low 
level  f o r  a  pecriod of about a  y e a r ,  during which the t ransfonmational  
g r a m m a r  roughly doubled i n  s i ze  f r o m  about 35 ru le s  to ove r  70 a s  c o v e r -  
age was cxtcndsd t o  include such s t r u c t u r e s  a s  numer ica l  quantif iers ,  t i m e  
eosnpounds, and var ious  express ions  involving rank  ahd ordinality.  The 
principal  cos t s  of ambiguity suppress ion  w e r e  felt not in  the ana lys i s  pro- 
g r a m s ,  which requ i red  only negligible modification for  tha t  purpose, but 
r a t h e r  in the su r face  g r a m m a r ,  which g rew much l a r g e r  and m o r e  complex 
to the point where  i t  became r a t h e r  difficult to  work with. Since a number  
of additional extensions of g r a m m a t i c a l  coverage w e r e  under  act ive  con- 
siderat ion - - among t h e m  the r e s t ~ r a t i o n  of c l a s s i f i e r  construct ions  to the 
subse t  - -  it seemed des i rab le  to s e e k  out s o m e  nebw approach t o  ambiguity 
suppress ion which? would not fu r the r  overburden the su r face  g r a m m a r .  
The a l te rna t ives  originally cons idered  w e r e  uniformly unattract ive.  
In h e  c a s e  of the c l a s s i f i e r  constructions,  one could have achieved the 
immedia te  objective by s imply  loading up the  phrase  lexicon with a n  e n t r y  
f o r  e a c h  legi t imate  pair ing of a c l a s s i f i e r  with a p roper  noun, thereby  
achieving a mihor  gain in g r a m m a t i c a l  coverage  a t  the  p r i ce  of m o r e  than 
doubling the  s i z e  of t h e  lexicon. Another approach would have involved 
crea t ing  phrasa l  e n t r i e s  only for  the c l a s s i f i e r s  themse lves  --  e .  g . ,  
"the c i ty  of", the s t a t e  of", etc.  - -  leaving it to  s p e c i a l  ad hoc rout inas  a t  
the end of the p r e p r o c e s s o r  first to  check the p reprocessed  s t r ing f o r  the  
p resence  of immediate ly  following p r o p e r  nouns of the  corresponding s e m a n -  
t i c  c l a s s  and then to  effect  the appropr ia te  amalgamat ions  o r  deletions. 
The second a l t e r t ~ a t i v e  was quickly re jec ted  as  even m o r e  dis tas teful  
than tEe f i r s t ,  s ince despi te  i t s  re la t ive ly  s m a l l  in i t ia l  :ost, i t  would, i f  
used at a l l  extensively, have mcant  abandonment of an o therwise  o r d e r l y  
and perspicuous ana lys i s  procedbre.  This  t r a i n  of thought, however,  
eventually led to the  idea of modifying the  p reprocessed  s t r ing  not by ad 
hoc subroutines requi r ing  accre t ions  t o  the  program,  but hy m e a n s  of 
locally defined t ransformat iona l  r u l e s  employing the  s a m e  computat ional  
appara tus  and notational conventions a s  the existing forward  and  inve r se  
t ransformat ions .  Within a week of its conception, the  idea of a s t r i n g  
t ransformat ion  facili ty became a rea l i ty  through s o m e  minor  modifications 
to the  flow of control  of the p a r s e r .  
% Much of the e a s e  of th i s  t rans i t ion  s t e m m e d  f r o m  the general i ty  of the 
or iginal  p roperana lys i s  mechanism,  which was designed t o  accept  a

4. The Use of Str ing Transformat ions  in the  REQUEST Sys tem 
>h 
Because they apply to s t r ings  of unconnected lexical  t r e e s ,  rabher 
than t o  ful l  sur face  t r e e s  with t h e i r  r ep resen ta t ion  of the s t r u c t u r e  of 
p h r a s e s  and c l auses ,  s t r ing  t r ans fo rmat ions  tend to be re la t ively  local in 
scope,  typically being r e s t r i c t e d  to construct ions  with contiguous e lements .  
Despite th is  inherent  l imitation, such  r u l e s  rapidly  found a wide var ie ty  of 
uses within the REQUEST System: Class i f i e r  construct ions  w e r e  readily 
identified md t rans fo rmed  into c l a s  s i f ie r le  ss coun te rpa r t s  by a handful of 
s t r ing  t ransformat ions .  Rules w e r e  a l so  wr i t t en  f o r  suppress ing  incor rec t  
s t randed  preposit ions,  resolving homography, and t rans la t ing  ce r t a in  
id ioms into a f o r m  m o r e  manageable fo r  the  su r face  p a r s e r .  Finally,  ex 
per iments  were  undertaken to explore  the possibili ty of employing s t r ing  
t ransformat ions  to dea l  with a l imited but potentially useful range of con- 
junction construations.  
A conlmon th read  running through s e v e r a l  of these  apparently d ive r se  
applications of s t r ing  t ransformat ions  is the  application of what would 
otherwise  have been t r ea ted  a s  the  inve r se  of a la te  postcyclic t r a n s f o r m a -

what a r e  i n  effect par t ia l  surface s t r u c t u r e s  a s  output. In fact ,  it i s  
quite pos'siblc that  an  appropr ia te ly  chosen cyclical ly o r d e r e d  s e t  of 
s t r ing  t ransformat ions  could supplant the su r face  g r a m m a r  cn t i re ly ,  how-

s t r ing  t ransformat ions ;  while in  the c a s e  of s t randed  preposit ion p reven -

the load of an  existing postcyclic blocking rule ,  resul t ing in a highly bene- 
f ic ia l  el imination of unwanted su r face  p a r s e s  in both ins tances .  In o ther

The s t r u c t u r a l  pat tern  (possibly qualified by fu r the r  cons t ra in ts  ex-

E x p r e s s e d  in ~ d i n a r y  English, the  s t a t e m e n t  of the  ru le  r e a d s  about

than a cardinal. 
The approach just descr ibed  has  the advantage of putting a n  unlimited 
s e t  of ord ina ls  a t  the disposal  of the u s e r  a t  negligible cost ,  involving a 
few very  minor  additions to  the  lexicon and none a t  a l l  to  e i the r  the su r face  
g r a m m a r  or the p r e p r o c e s s o r .  The a l t e rna te  of using a postcyclic t r a n s -  
formation instead of a s t r ing  t ransformat ion  to achieve the s a m e  coverage 
w a s  avoided because it would have imposed the  additional r equ i remen t  that  
the sur face  g r a m m a r  be significantly enlarged through the inclusion of a t  
l e a s t  t h r e e  new ca tegory  symbols  (for card ina ls ,  ordinals ,  and ordinal  
suff ixes)  along with a s e t  of context- f ree  r u l e s  descr ibing t h e i r  d is t r ibu-  
tion. Although identification of ordinal n u m e r a l s  of th is  type  could also 
have been effected by buildingrthe appropr ia te  t e s t s  d i rect ly  into the p r e p r o -  
ce*s so r ,  the Zatte r a l tcrnat lve  would have been much l e s s  a t t r a c t w e  than 
the s t r ing  t ransformat ion  approach for  a t  l e a s t  two reasons :  F i r s t ,  it i s  
inhere-ntly p e s s i e r  to bury suc-11 operat ions  in  a spec ia l  program subroutine 
than to deal  with them a s  just  another  t ransformat iona l  rule.  Second, and 
more important ,  is the fact that  the la t te r  approach  makes the s y s t e m  less 
general and flexible, since ma te r i a l  specific to  English is directly r e -  
flected in the. s t r u c t u r e  of the  program itself, r a t h e r  t h a n  being confined 
t o  the grammar, where  it is readily accessible t o  the  l iaguist  who may 
wish t o  modify it -or replace- it by material describing some other na tu ra l

to the rule-processing,  routine) ; (iv) the final instance of a semantically 
compatible p r o p e r  noun, and (v) the usual  end variable.  
The s t ruc tura l  change specifies (1)  that  the t e rmina l  e lements  of 
all  but the rightmost conjunct (which a re  collectively associated with 
the pattern element  (W . 2 )  during the pattern matching phase)  a r e  to  be 
s i s t e r  adjoined t o  the t e rmina l  e lement  of that r ightmost  conjunct and 
(2 )  that  the original  occur rences  of a l l  t r e e s  but those  corresponding t o  
the end variabbes and the final conjunct a r e  to be deleted. Conditional 
on the presence of the conjunction "and" (AND . 4 ) ,  the feature change 
adds  the feature (+ ANDSET)  to  the fea tu re  l is t  of the surviving INDEX 
and the feature (- S G )  to  that  of the NOUN node immediately above. 
(The la t t e r  operation automatically r e  sul ts  in  replacement  of the or iginal  
(f SG)).  I? the conjunction i s  a n  "or" (ORR . 5) instead, the fea ture  
change mere ly  adds  the fea ture  (t ORSET) to the fea ture  l i s t  of the 
INDEX, leaving the number of the NOUN unchanged. 
The overal l  effect of the rule  ref lec ts  the by now famil iar  s t ra tegy 
of mapping a s t ruc ture  which would otherwise pose seve re  problems in 
surface parsing into a significantly simpler one which will be processed 
without difficulty by both the surface parser and the t ransformational  
p a r s e r .  As i n  t h e  case of CITYSTATE and RNKINTVL, a s p e c i a l  f ea -  
tur-e is at tached t o  the  node in the  output s t r u c t u r e  tha t  d i rec t ly  dominates  
two o r  more t e r m i n a l  symbols  a s  a r e s u l t  of the 5 t r u c t u r a l  change of the  
ru le .  In each  c a s e ,  the  purpose o f  t he  f ea tu re  is to  communica te  t~ the 
semant i c  i n t e r p r e t e r  how the e l emen t s  of the set of t e r m i n a l  symbols  a r e  
to be t r ea ted  --  as a ( c i t y ,  s t a t e )  pa i r ,  a s  the endpoints of a dense  set of 
integers,  o r  a s  the  e l emen t s  of a conjoined set  of p roper  nouns. 
The exper imen ta l  approach  t o  p roper  naun conjunction jus t  desc r ibed  
appeared ini t ial ly to be a r a t h e r  effect ive one. Examples such  a s  (14)

F u r t h e r  invest igat ion indicdted tha t  the  ambigui t ies  encountered  w e r e

t ions suggests  that  the re  may be some value in  viewing the  faci l i ty in terms 
of such relat ionships.  However, the rule w r i t e r  is ent i re ly  f ree  t o  ignore  
linguistic considcrat ions of th is  s o r t  and define any of a wide range  of tr 'ee 
manipulations a s  s t r i ng  t r a n s f o r n ~ a t i o n s .  Accordingly,  the s t r ing  t r a n s -  
fdrmat ion facili ty can,with some justification, simply be viewed as a con- 
venient mechan i sm whereby the t r e e  process ing  powar inherent  in gramma- 
t ical  t ransformat ions  is made  available fo r  purposes  of implementing a wide 
variety of parsing heur i s t ic  s. 
In c o n t r a s t  to the obscur i ty  of its theore t i ca l  role, the  str'ing t rans-  
format ion facili ty of REQUEST has had a c lear  and decidedly favorable  
impact ozi the  practical development of the system. The facility was 
originally added in  o r d e r  t o  provide a more sa t i s fac torv  input in terface  t o  
the t ransformat iona l  p a r s e r  - - a n  in te r face  which would be considerably 
l e s s  vulnerable to the undc s i r ab le  side -effects of expand-ing g rammat ica l  
coverage  than one consist ing solely of a p reprokesso r  and a sur face  
p a r s e r .  More specifically, this  innovation was a imed  at  preventing the 
proliferat ion of unwanted sur face  parses in  a way which would be a t  once 
l e s s  cost ly  and m o r e  perspicuous than a l te rna t ives  requir ing extension of 
the p reprocesso r  o r  of  the sur face  g r a m m a r .  
Based on approximately one y e a r ' s  exper ience  i n  the use  of the s t r ing  
t ransformat ion  facility, it appears t o  have fulfilled these or iz inal  objec - 
t ives .  During th i s  period, the g r a m m a t i c a l  coverage  of REQlJEST has  
been significantly expanded, but the lexicon and the surtace,  g r a m m a r  have 
undergone only v e r y  modes t  growth a s  a resul t ,  and there  has been no 
accompanying upsurge in the number  of spur ious  su r face  pa r ses .  The 
s t r a t egy  of reo-rdering the Inverses  of ce r t a ln  late postcyclic r u l e s  within,  
the parsing system by placing them before,  rather than after, the surface 
s t r u c t u r e  ru les  h a s  provea to be effective both in reducing the number  of 
unwanted sur face  ana lyses  and in simplifying the su r face  g r a m m a r  (and 
hence the s t r u c t u r e s  that  it produces) .  Moreover ,  stririg t ransformat ions  
have a lso  shown a n  unexpected versat i l i ty  in such a r e a s  a s  id iom process-  
ing and homograph r e  solution. 
In con t ras t  to  these  favorable r e su l t s ,  our  a t tempt  to employ s t r ing  
t r ans fo rmat ions  i n  dealing with conjunction construct ions  - -  while of g rea t  
indirect  benefit - -  can  hardly b e  vie-wed a s  a n  unqualified success .  W h a t  
the la t te r  exper ience h a s  c l ea r ly  demonst ra ted  is the fac t  tha t  s t r i n g  
t r a n s f o r n ~ a t i o n s  a r e  a tool, not a panacea, and cannot be expected to yield 
sa t i s fac tory  r e su l t s  i n  areas where the n e c e s s a r y  linguistic groundwork 
is lacking. Despite its l imitat ions,  we e q e c t  to make cont inuedheavy 
use  of this tool in our  ongoing work on extending the  g r a ~ n n ~ a t i c a l  coverage- 
of the REQUEST System. 
-Appendix: Listing of String Transformat ions  
The following is 9 complete  computer  l isting of a l l  3 3  s t r ing  t r a n s f o r -  
mat ions  in  the  REQUEST System g r a m m a r  a s  of October 1974. The 
ful ly-parenthesized list notation employed in  the  computer  file h a s  been 
"pret ty printed" i. e. , printed with indentat ions)  in  o r d e r  t o  make  the 
in te rna l  s t ruc tu re  of the  ru les  m o r e  legible. Each  l i s t  i s  sur raunded  by 
a pair  of parentheses ,  with its m a i n  components ( if  any) in  gene ra l  printed 
s ta r t ing  two spaces  to  the right  of the  beginning of t h e i r  "parent" l is t .  
Thus, for  example, the left  paren thes is  of the pa i r  surrounding each  ru le  
i s  indented two spaces  t o  the r igh t  of the  left  parenthesis  that  in i t ia tes  the 
e n t i r e  l i s t  of rules .  Similarly,  with the  e x c e p t i ~ r i  of the header  list (which 
is indented only one space  t o  make  it stand out), the  main  components of 
each  ru le  - - the header ,  s t r u c t u r a l  pat tern,  condition, s t r u c t u r a l  cha-nge 
and feature  change - - a r e  indented two spaces  with r e s p e c t  to the  rule,  and 
s o  forth. 
In cont ras t  to  the two-dimensional graphical  representa t ion  employed 
f o r  t r e e s  in the f igures  in  Section 4 of the text, t r e e s  in  the l is t ing a r e  r e p  
resented  in  a linear, parenthesized notation with the  following es sen t i a l  
cha rac te r i s t i c s :  
1. - Within a s t r u c t u r a l  pattern, a n  express ion  of the f o r m  (A B C . . . D ) 
s tands  for  a t r e e  of the  f o r m  
B, C . . . D themselves  may be rep laced  by parenthesized express ions  
that  s tand fo r  subtrees ,  etc. As in the f igures  of Section 4, a s  socia t ionv 
of a f ea tu re  list with a no& is denoted by enclosing the list in one pa i r  of 
parentheses  and then surrounding the node and the l i s t  with a second pai r  
of parentheses ,  e. g. ( A  ( + FEATl - 'FEAT2 ) ) . In place of the cu r ly  
bracke t  notation used in the  f igures  to  denote mutually exclusive sequerrces 
of t r e e s ,  the  listing employs express ions  of the f o r m  (OR ( l i s t  of t r e e s 1  ) 
(list of t r e e s  2 )  . . . (list of t r e e s n  ) ) ,  where  the a rgument s  of thei  OR stand 
in  one-to-one correspondence with the sequences  of t r e e s .  Thus, for 
example, the express ion  
(OR 
( ( ( m p  . 2 )  ( W .  5 ) ) )  
( ( ( P R E P O F .  3 )  ( W  :5 ) ) ) )  
in the s t r u c t u r a l  pat tern  of the rule SPREPREV (p.77- ) corresponds  to  
the  cu r ly  bracket  express ion  f i a t  appea r s  n e a r  the t op  of Figore 4 (p..33 ) . 
2. Within a condJtion, s t r u c t u r a l  change, O r  f ea ture  change, t r e e s  are 
r ep resen ted  in a fully parenthesized ' d res sed"  notation which con t ras t s  a s  
follows with the  "peeled" notation just descr ibed  for t r e e s  in s t r u c t u r a l  
pat terns:  Each node in a t r e e  always has two pa i r s  of associa ted paren-  
-
t heses  ,- an inner pair  surrounding the  node and its fea ture  l i s t  (if any)  
and a n  outer  pa i r  enclosing the node, the  fea ture  list ,  and any sub t rees  
dominated by the node. Each fea ture  list contains a t  l eas t  two p a i r s  of 
parentheses  - -  one surrounding the e n t i r e  ligt, and one for  each (feature 
value, feature name)  pair.  Thus in  "dressed"  notation the "peeled'ex- 
press ions  ( A  B C . D ) and ( A  ( + F E A T l  - FEAT 2 ) ) become 
( ( A )  ( ( B ) )  C -  ( ( D ) ) )  and ( ( A ( ( +  FEATl) ( -  F E A T Z ) ) ) )  
respectively.
