It is well-known that part of speech depends on 
context. The word "table," for example, can be 
a verb in some contexts (e.g., "He will table the 
motion") and a noun in others (e.g., "The table 
is ready"). A program has been written which 
tags each word in an input sentence with the 
most likely part of speech. The program 
produces the following output for the two 
"table" sentences just mentioned: 
? He/PPS will/lVlD table/VB the/AT 
motion/NN ./. 
? The/AT table\]NN is/BEZ ready/J/./. 
(PPS = subject pronoun; MD = modal; V'B = 
verb (no inflection); AT = article; NN = noun; 
BEZ ffi present 3rd sg form of "to be"; Jl = 
adjective; notation is borrowed from \[Francis and 
Kucera, pp. 6-8\]) 
Part of speech tagging is an important practical 
problem with potential applications in many 
areas including speech synthesis, speech 
recognition, spelling correction, proof-reading, 
query answering, machine translation and 
searching large text data bases (e.g., patents, 
newspapers). The author is particularly 
interested in speech synthesis applications, where 
it is clear that pronunciation sometimes depends 
on part of speech. Consider the foUowing three 
examples where pronunciation depends on part 
of speech. First, there are words like "wind" 
where the noun has a different vowel than the 
verb. That is, the noun "wind" has a short 
vowel as in "the wind is strong," whereas the 
verb "wind" has a long vowel as in "Don't 
forget to wind your watch." Secondly, the 
pronoun "that" is stressed as in "Did you see 
THAT?" unlike the complementizer "that," as 
in "It is a shame that he's leaving." Thirdly, 
note the difference between "oily FLUID" and 
"TRANSMISSION fluid"; as a general rule, an 
adjective-noun sequence such as "oily FLUID" 
is typically stressed on the fight whereas a 
noun-noun sequence such as "TRANSMISSION 
fluid" is typically stressed on the left. These are 
but three of the many constructions which would 
sound more natural if the synthesizer had access 
to accurate part of speech information. 
Perhaps the most important application of 
tagging programs is as a tool for future research. 
A number of large projects such as \[Cobufld\] 
have recently been collecting large corpora (10- 
1000 million words) in order to better describe 
how language is actually used in practice: 
"For the first time, a dictionary has been 
compiled by the thorough examination of 
representative group of English texts, spoken 
and written, running to many millions of 
words. This means that in addition to all the 
tools of the conventional dictionary makers... 
the dictionary is based on hard, measureable 
evidence." \[Cobuild, p. xv\] 
It is likely that there will be more and more 
research projects collecting larger and larger 
corpora. A reliable parts program might greatly 
enhance the value of these corpora to many of 
these researchers. 
The program uses a linear time dynamic 
programming algorithm to find an assignment of 
parts of speech to words that optimizes the 
product of (a) lexical probabilities (probability of 
observing part of speech i given word j), and (b) 
contextual probabilities (probability of observing 
part of speech i given k previous parts of 
speech). Probability estimates were obtained by 
training on the Tagged Brown Corpus \[Francis 
and Kucera\], a corpus of approximately 
1,000,000 words with part of speech tags 
assigned laboriously by hand over many years. 
Program performance is encouraging (95-99% 
"correct", depending on the definition of 
"correct"). A small 400 word sample is 
presented in the Appendix, and is judged to be 
99.5% correct. It is surprising that a local 
"bottom-up" approach can perform so well. 
Most errors are attributable to defects in the 
lexicon; remarkably few errors are related to the 
inadequacies of the extremely over-simplified 
grammar (a trigram model). Apparently, "long 
distance" dependences are not very important, at 
136
least most of the time. 
One might have thought that ngram models 
weren't adequate for the task since it is well- 
known that they are inadequate for determining 
grammaticality: 
"We find that no finite-state Markov process 
that produces ymbols with transition from 
state to state can serve as an English 
grammar. Furthermore, the particular 
subclass of such processes that produce n- 
order statistical approximations to English do 
not come closer, with increasing n, to 
matching the output of an English granunar." 
\[Chomsky, p. 113\] 
Chomsky's conclusion was based on the 
observation that constructions such as: 
? If St then $2. 
? Either $3, or $4. 
? The man who said that S s, is arriving today. 
have long distance dependencies that span across 
any fixed length window n. Thus, ngram 
models are clearly inadequate for many natural 
language applications. However, for the tagging 
application, the ngram approximation may be ac- 
ceptable since long distance dependencies do not 
seem to be very important. 
Statistical ngram models were quite popular in 
the 1950s, and have been regaining popularity 
over the past few yeats. The IBM speech group 
is perhaps the strongest advocate of ngram 
methods, especially in other applications such as 
speech recognition. Robert Mercer (private 
communication, 1982) has experimented with the 
tagging application, using a restricted corpus 
(laser patents) and small vocabulary (1000 
words). Another group of researchers working 
in Lancaster around the same time, Leech, 
Garside and Atwell, also found ngram models 
highly effective; they report 96.7% success in 
automatically tagging the LOB Corpus, using a 
bigram model modified with heuristics to cope 
with more important trigrams. The present work 
developed independently from the LOB project. 
1. How Hard is Lexical Ambiguity? 
Many people who have not worked in 
computational linguistics have a strong intuition 
that lexical ambiguity is usually not much of a 
problem. It is commonly believed that most 
words have just one part of speech, and that the 
few exceptions such as "table" are easily 
disambiguated by context in most cases, in 
contrast, most experts in computational linguists 
have found lexical ambiguity to be a major 
issue; it is said that practically any content word 
can be used as a noun, verb or adjective, 1 and 
that local context is not always adequate to 
disambiguate. Introductory texts are full of 
ambiguous sentences such as 
? Time flies like an arrow. 
? Flying planes can be dangerous. 
where no amount of syntactic parsing will help. 
These examples are generally taken to indicate 
that the parser must allow for multiple 
possibilities and that grammar formalisms uch 
as LR(k) are inadequate for natural language 
since these formalisms cannot cope with 
ambiguity. This argument was behind a large set 
of objections to Marcus' "LR(k)-like" Deter- 
ministic Parser. 
Although it is clear that an expert in compu- 
tational inguistics can dream up arbitrarily hard 
sentences, it may be, as Marcus suggested, that 
most texts ate not very hard in practice. Recall 
that Marcus hypothesized most decisions can be 
resolved by the parser within a small window 
(i.e., three buffer cells), and there are only a few 
problematic cases where the parser becomes 
confuse& He called these confusing cases 
"garden paths," by analogy with the famous 
example: 
? The horse raced past the barn fell. 
With just a few exceptions such as these 
"garden paths," Marcus assumes, there is almost 
always a unique "best" interpretation which Can 
be found with very limited resources. The 
proposed stochastic approach is largely 
compatible with this; the proposed approach 
1. From an information theory point of view, one can 
quantity ambiguity in bits. In the case of the Brown 
Tagged Corpus, the lexical entropy, the conditional 
entropy of the part of speech given the word is about 0.25 
bits per part of speech. This is considerably smaller than 
the contextual entropy, the conditional entropy of the part 
of speech given the next two parts of speech. This 
entropy is estimated to be about 2 bits per part of speech. 
137
assumes that it is almost always sufficient to 
assign each word a unique "best" part of speech 
(and this can be accomplished with a very 
efficient linear time dynamic programming 
algorithm). After reading introductory 
discussions of "Flying planes can be 
dangerous," one might have expected that 
lexical ambiguity was so pervasive that it would 
be hopeless to try to assign just one part of 
speech to each word and in just one linear time 
pass over the input words. 
2. Lexical Disambiguation Rules 
However, the proposed stochastic method is 
considerably simpler than what Marcus had in 
mind. His thesis parser used considerably more 
syntax than the proposed stochastic method. 
Consider the following pair described in 
\[Marcus\]: 
? Have/VB \[the students who missed the exam\] 
TAKE the exam today. (imperative) 
. Have/AUX \[the students who missed the 
exam\] TAKEN the exam today? (question) 
where it appears that the parser needs to look 
past an arbitrarily long noun phrase in order to 
correctly analyze "have," which could be either 
a tenseless main verb (imperative) or a tensed 
auxiliary verb (question). Marcus' rather 
unusual example can no longer be handled by 
Fidditch, a more recent Marcus-style parser with 
very large coverage. In order to obtain such 
large coverage, Fidditch has had to take a more 
robust/modest view of lexical disambiguation. 
Whereas Marcus' Parsifal program distinguished 
patterns uch as "have NP tenseless" and "have 
NP past-participle," most of Fidditch's 
diagnostic rules axe less ambitious and look only 
for the start of a noun phrase and do not attempt 
to look past an arbitrarily long noun phrase. For 
example, Fidditch has the following lexical 
disambiguation rule: 
? (defiule n+prep! 
" > \[**n+prep\] !=n \[npstarters\]") 
which says that a preposition is more likely than 
a noun before a noun phrase. More precisely, 
the rule says that ff a noun/preposition 
ambiguous word (e.g., "out")  is followed by 
something that starts a noun phrase (e.g., a 
determiner), then rule out the noun possibility. 
This type of lexical diagnostic rule can be 
captured with bigram and trigram statistics; it 
turns out that the sequence ...preposition 
determiner.., is much more common in the 
Brown Corpus (43924 observations) than the 
sequence ...noun determiner... (1135 
observations). Most lexical disambiguation rules 
in Fidditch can be reformulated in terms of 
bigram and trigram statistics in this way. 
Moreover, it is worth doing so, because bigram 
and trigram statistics are much easier to obtain 
than Fidditch-type disambiguation rules, which 
are extremely tedious to program, test and 
debug. 
In addition, the proposed stochastic approach can 
naturally take advantage of lexical probabilities 
in a way that is not easy to capture with parsers 
that do not make use of frequency information. 
Consider, for example, the word "see," which is 
almost always a verb, but does have an archaic 
nominal usage as in "the Holy See." For 
practical purposes, "see"  should not be 
considered noun/verb ambiguous in the same 
sense as truly ambiguous words like "program," 
"house" and "wind"; the nominal usage of 
"see"  is possible, but not likely. 
If every possibility in the dictionary must be 
given equal weight, parsing is very difficult. 
Dictionaries tend to focus on what is possible, 
not on what is likely. Consider the trivial 
sentence, " I  see a bird." For all practical 
purposes, every word in the sentence is 
unambiguous. According to \[Francis and 
Kucera\], the word 'T '  appears as a pronoun 
(PPLS) in 5837 out of 5838 observations 
(-100%), "see" appears as a verb in 771 out of 
772 observations C100%), "a"  appears as an 
article in 23013 out of 23019 observations 
('100%) and "bird" appears as a noun in 26 out 
of 26 observations C100%). However, according 
to Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary, 
every word is ambiguous. In addition to the 
desired assignments of tags, the first thee words 
are listed as nouns and the last as an intransitive 
verb. One might hope that these spurious 
assignments could be ruled out by the parser as 
syntactically ill-formed. Unfortunately, this is 
nnlikely to work. If the parser is going to accept 
noun phrases of the form: 
? \[N'P IN city\] IN school\] IN committee\] IN 
meeting\]\] 
then it can't rule out 
138
? \[NP IN I\] IN see\] \[N a\] IN bird\]\] 
Similarly, the parser probably also has to accept 
"bird" as an intransitive verb, since there is 
nothing syntactically wrong with: 
? \[S \[NP \[N I\] \[N see\] \[1'4 a\]\] \[V1 a \[V bird\]\]\] 
These part of speech assignments aren't wrong; 
they are just extremely improbable. 
3. The Proposed Method 
Consider once again the sentence, " I  see a 
bird." The problem is to find an assignment of 
parts of speech to words that optimizes both 
lexical and contextual probabilities, both of 
which are estimated from the Tagged Brown 
Corpus. The lexical probabilities axe estimated 
from the following frequencies: 
Word 
I 
see 
a 
bird 
Parts of Speech 
PPSS 5837 
VB 771 
AT 23013 
NN 26 
NP 1 
UH 1 
IN (French) 6 
(PPSS = pronoun; NP = proper noun; VB = 
verb; UH = interjection; IN = preposition; AT = 
article; NN = noun) 
The lexical probabilities are estimated in the 
obvious way. For example, the probability that 
'T '  is a pronoun, Prob(PPSS\['T'), is estimated 
as the freq(PPSSl 'T') / freq('T')  or 5837/5838. 
The probability that "see" is a verb is estimated 
to be 771/772. The other lexical probability 
estimates follow the same pattern. 
The contextual probability, the probability of 
observing part of speech X given the following 
two parts of speech Y and Z, is estimated by 
dividing the trigram frequency XYZ by the 
bigram frequency YZ. Thus, for example, the 
probability of observing a verb before an article 
and a noun is estimated to be the ratio of the 
freq(VB, AT, NN) over the freq(AT, NN) or 
3412/53091 = 0.064. The probability of 
observing a noun in the same context is 
estimated as the ratio of freq(NN, AT, NN) over 
53091 or 629/53091 = 0.01. The other 
contextual probability estimates follow the same 
pattern. 
A search is performed in order to find the 
assignment of part of speech tags to words that 
optimizes the product of the lexical and 
contextual probabilities. Conceptually, the 
search enumerates all possible assignments of 
parts of speech to input words. In this case, 
there are four input words, three of which are 
two ways ambiguous, producing a set of 
2*2*2* 1=8 possible assignments of parts of 
speech to input words: 
I see a bird 
PPSS VB AT NN 
PPSS VB IN NN 
PPSS UH AT NN 
PPSS UH IN NN 
NP VB AT NN 
NP VB IN NN 
N'P UH AT NN 
NP UH IN NN 
Each of the eight sequences are then scored by 
the product of the lexical probabilities and the 
contextual probabilities, and the best sequence is
selected. In this case, the first sequence is by far 
the best. 
In fact, it is not necessary to enumerate all 
possible assignments because the scoring 
function cannot see more than two words away. 
In other words, in the process of enumerating 
part of speech sequences, it is possible in some 
cases to know that some sequence cannot 
possibly compete with another and can therefore 
be abandoned. Because of this fact, only O(n) 
paths will be enumerated. Let us illustrate this 
optimization with an example: 
Find all assignments of parts of speech to 
"bird" and score the partial sequence. 
Henceforth, all scores are to be interpreted as log 
probabilities. 
(-4.848072 "NN") 
Find all assignments of parts of speech to "a"  
and score. At this point, there are two paths: 
(-7.4453945 "AT" "NN") 
(-15.01957 "IN" "NN") 
Now, find assignments of "see" and score. At 
this point, the number of paths seem to be 
growing exponentially. 
139
(- 10.1914 "VB" "AT" "NN") 
(-18.54318 "VB" "IN" "NN") 
(-29.974142 "UIT' "AT" "NN") 
(-36.53299 "UH" "IN" "NN") 
Now, find assignments of " I "  and score. Note, 
however, that it is no longer necessary to 
hypothesize that "a"  might be a French 
preposition IN because all four paths, PPSS VB 
IN NN, NN VB IN NN, PPSS UH IN NN and 
NP UH AT NN score less well than some other 
path and there is no way that any additional 
input could make any difference. In particular, 
the path, PPSS VB IN NN scores less well than 
the path PPSS VB AT NN, and additional input 
will not help PPSS VB IN NN because the 
contextual scoring function has a limited window 
of three parts of speech, and that is not enough 
to see past the existing PPSS and VB. 
(-12.927581 "PPSS" "VB .... AT" "NN") 
(-24.177242 "NP" "VB .... AT" "NN") 
(-35.667458 "PPSS" "UH" "AT" "NN") 
(-44.33943 "NP" "UH" "AT" "NN") 
The search continues two more iterations, 
assuming blank parts of speech for words out of 
range. 
(-13.262333 ...... PPSS" "VB" "AT" "NN") 
(-26.5196 ...... NP" "VB .... AT" "NN") 
F'mally, the result is: PPSS VB AT NN. 
(-12.262333 .......... PPSS .... VB" "AT" "NN") 
The final result is: I/PPSS see/VB a/AT bird/NN. 
A slightly more interesting example is: "Can 
they can cans." 
cans  
(-5.456845 "NNS") 
ca l l  
(-12.603266 "NN" "NNS") 
(-15.935471 "VB" "NNS") 
(-15.946739 "biD" "NNS") 
they 
(-18.02618 "PPSS" "biD" "NNS") 
(- 18.779934 "PPSS" "Vii" "NNS") 
(-21.411636 "PPSS" "NN" "NNS ") 
ca l l  
(-21.766554 "MD" "PPSS" "VB" "NNS") 
(-26.45485 "NN" "PPSS" "MD" "NNS") 
(-28.306572 "VB .... PPSS" "MD" "NNS") 
(-21.932137 ...... MD" "PPSS" "VB .... NNS") 
(-30.170452 ...... VB" "PPSS" "MD" "NNS") 
(-31.453785 ...... NN" "PPSS" "MD" "NNS") 
And the result is: Can/MD they/PPSS can/VB 
cans/NNS 
(-20.932137 .......... MD" "PPSS" "V'B" "NNS") 
4. Parsing Simple Non-Recursive Noun Phrases 
Stochastically 
Similar stochastic methods have been applied to 
locate simple noun phrases with very high 
accuracy. The program inserts brackets into a 
sequence of parts of speech, producing output 
such as: 
\[MAT former/AP top/NN aide/NN\] to/IN 
\[Attomey/NP General/NP Edwin/NP Meese/NP\] 
interceded/VBD to/TO extend/VB Jan/AT 
aircraft/NN company/NN \[business/NN\] with/IN 
\[a/AT lobbyist/NN\] \[who/WPS\] worked/VBD 
for/IN \[the/AT defense/NN contractor/NN\] ,/, 
according/IN to/IN \[a/AT published/VBN re- 
port/NN\] .L 
The proposed method is a stochastic analog of 
precedence parsing. Recall that precedence 
parsing makes use of a table that says whether to 
insert an open or close bracket between any two 
categories (terminal or nonterminal). The 
proposed method makes use of a table that gives 
the probabilities of an open and close bracket 
between all pairs of parts of speech. A sample 
is shown below for the five parts of speech: AT 
(article), NN (singular noun), NNS (non-singular 
noun), VB (uninflected verb), IN (preposition). 
The table says, for example, that there is no 
chance of starting a noun phrases after an article 
(all five entries on the AT row are O) and that 
there is a large probability of starting a noun 
phrase between a verb and an noun (the entry in 
140
(vB, AT) is LO). 
Probability of Starting a Noun Phrase 
AT NN NNS VB IN 
AT 
NN 
NNS 
VB 
IN 
0 0 0 0 0 
.99 .01 0 0 0 
1.O .02 .11 0 0 
1.0 1.0 1.0 0 0 
1.0 1.0 1.0 0 0 
Probability of Ending a Noun Phrase 
AT NN NNS VB IN 
AT 
NN 
NNS 
VB 
IN 
0 0 0 0 0 
1.0 .01 0 0 1.0 
1.0 .02 .l I 1.0 1.0 
0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 .02 
These probabilities were estimated from about 
40,000 words (11,000 noun phrases) of training 
material selected from the Brown Corpus. The 
training material was parsed into noun phrases 
by laborious semi-automatic means (with 
considerable help from Eva Ejerhed). It took 
about a man-week to prepare the training 
material. 
The stochastic parser is given a sequence of parts 
of speech as input and is asked to insert brackets 
corresponding to the beginning and end of noun 
phrases. Conceptually, the parser enumerates all 
possible parsings of the input and scores each of 
them by the precedence probabilities. Consider, 
for example, the input sequence: bin VB. There 
are 5 possible ways to bracket this sequence 
(assuming no recursion): 
.NNVB 
? \ [~ \ ]W 
? INN VB\ ]  
? INN\ ]  \ [VB\ ]  
? NN \ [VB\ ]  
Each of these parsings is scored by multiplying 6 
precedence probabilities, the probability of an 
open/close bracket appearing (or not appearing) 
in any one of the three positions (before the NN, 
after the NN or after the VB). The parsing with 
the highest score is returned as output. 
A small sample of the output is given in the 
appendix. The method works remarkably well 
considering how simple it is. There is some 
tendency to underestimate the number of 
brackets and nan two noun phrases together as in 
\[NP the time Fairchild\]. The proposed method 
omitted only 5 of 243 noun phrase brackets in 
the appendix. 
5. Smoothing Issues 
Some of the probabilities are very hard to 
estimate by direct counting because of ZipFs 
Law (frequency is roughly proportional to 
inverse rank). Consider, for example, the lexical 
probabilities. We need to estimate how often 
each word appears with each part of speech. 
Unfoaunately, because of ZipFs Law, no matter 
how much text we look at, there will always be 
a large tail of words that appear only a few 
times. In the Brown Corpus, for example, 
40,000 words appear five times or less. If a 
word such as "yawn" appears once as a noun 
and once as a verb, what is the probability that it 
can be an adjective? It is impossible to say 
without more information. Fortunately, 
conventional dictionaries can help alleviate this 
problem to some extent. We add one to the 
frequency count of possibilities in the dictionary. 
For example, "yawn" happens to be listed in 
our dictionary as noun/verb ambiguous. Thus, 
we smooth the frequency counts obtained from 
the Brown Corpus by adding one to both 
possibilities. In this case, the probabilities 
remain unchanged. Both before and after 
smoothing, we estimate "yawn" to be a noun 
50% of the time, and a verb the rest. There is 
no chance that "yawn" is an adjective. 
In some other cases, smoothing makes a big 
difference. Consider the word "cans." This 
word appears 5 times as a plural noun and never 
as a verb in the Brown Corpus. The lexicon 
(and its morphological routines), fortunately, 
give both possibilities. Thus, the revised 
estimate is that "cans" appears 6/7 times as a 
plural noun and 1/7 times as a verb. 
Proper nouns and capitalized words are 
particularly problematic; some capitalized words 
are proper nouns and some are not. Estimates 
from the Brown Corpus can be misleading. For 
example, the capitalized word "Acts"  is found 
twice in the Brown Corpus, both times as a 
141
proper noun (in a tide). It would be a mistake to 
infer from this evidence that the word "Acts" is 
always a proper noun. For this reason, 
capitalized words with small frequency counts (< 
20) were thrown out of the lexicon. 
There are other problems with capitalized words. 
Consider, for example, a sentence beginning with 
the capitalized word "Fall"; what is the 
probability that it is a proper noun (i.e., a 
surname)? Estimates from the Brown Corpus 
are of little help here since "Fall" never appears 
as a capitalized word and it never appears as a 
proper noun. Two steps were taken to alleviate 
this problem. First, the frequency estimates for 
"Fall" are computed from the estimates for 
"fal l" plus 1 for the proper noun possibility. 
Thus, "Fal l" has frequency estimates of: ((1 . 
"NP") (1 "JJ") (65 "VB") (72 . "NN")) 
because "fal l" has the estimates of: ((1 . "JJ") 
(65 . "VB") (72 . "NN")). Secondly, a prepass 
was introduced which labels words as proper 
nouns if they are "adjacent to" other capitalized 
words (e.g., "White House," "State of the 
Union") or if they appear several times in a 
discourse and are always capitalized. 
The lexical probabilities are not the only 
probabilities that require smoothing. Contextual 
frequencies also seem to follow Zipf's Law. 
That is, for the set of all sequences of three parts 
of speech, we have plotted the frequency of the 
sequence against its rank on log log paper and 
observed the classic (approximately) linear 
relationship and slope of (almost) -1. It is clear 
that the contextual frequencies require 
smoothing. Zeros should be avoided. 
6. Conclusion 
A stochastic part of speech program and noun 
phrase parser has been presented. Performance 
is very encouraging as can be seen from the 
Appendix.
