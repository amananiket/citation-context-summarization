1 Introduction 
Over l;he last lb.w years, eonsl;raint-based grammar 
tbrmalisms have become the predominmtt t)ar;tdigm 
in natural  language processing ~uld (:oulptltal;iollal 
linguistics. Their success stems from tim feet that

Section 3.4. 
3 TD? 
TDZ: is a unificatiol,-based grammar development en- 
vironment and run time system snpporting HPSG- 
like grammars. Work on TD? has started within the 
DISCO project of the DFKI \[14\] (this volume). The 
DISCO grammar currently consists of approx. 900 
type specifications written in TD? and is the largest 
HPSG grammar for German \[9\]. The core engine of 
DISCO consists of T/I? and the feature constraint 
solver //D/A~ \[3\]. ND/~ itself is a powerful untyped 
unification machinery which allows the use of dis- 
tributed disjunctions, general negation, and fllnction- 
al dependencies. The modules communicate through 
an interface, and this connection mirrors exactly the 
way an abstract typed unification algorithm works: 
two typed feature structures can only be unified if 
the attached types are definitely compatible. This 
is accomplished by the unifier in that ~ handles 
over two typed feature structures to TD? which gives 
back a simplified form (plus additional information; 
see Fig. 1). The motivation for separating type and 
featnre constraints and processing them in special- 
ized modules (which again might consist of special- 
ized components as is the case in 73)?) is twofold: (i) 
this strategy reduces the complexity of tile whole sys- 
tem, thus making the architecture clear, and (ii) leads 
to a higher performance of the whole system because 
every module is designed to cover only a specialized 
task. 
3.1 TD? Language 
7"D? supports type definitions consisting of type con- 
straints and feature constraints over the operators 
A, V, -1, and ? (xor). The operators are general- 
ized in that they can connect feature descriptions, 
coreference tags (logical variables) as well as types. 
77)? distinguishes between arm types (open-world se- 
mantics), sort types (closed-world semantics), built-in 
types (being made available by the underlying COM- 
MON LISP system), and atoms. Recursive types are 
explicitly allowed and handled by a sophisticated lazy 
type expansion mechanism. 
In asking for the greatest lower bound of two awn 
types a and b which share no common subtype, TD? 
always returns a A b (open-world reasoning), and not 
2_. The reason for assuming this is manifold: (i) par- 
tiality of our linguistic knowledge, (ii) approach is 
in harmony with terminological (KL-ONE-like) lan- 
guages which share a similar semantics, (iii) impor- 
tant during incremental grammar/lexicon construe- 
tion (which has been shown usefid in our project), 
and (iv) one must not write superfluous type defini- 
tions to guarantee successful type unifications during 
processing. 
The opposite case holds for the C, LB of sort types 
(closed-world approach). Furthermore, sort types dif- 
fer in another point from avm types in that they arc 
not fllrther structured, as is the case for atoIns. More- 
over, 779? oilers the possibility to declare partitions, 
a feature heavily used in IfPSG. In addition, one can 
declare sets of types as incompatible, meaning that 
the conjunction of them yields ?, so that specific avm 
types can be closed. 
7"D? allows a grammarian to define and use param- 
eterized templates (macros). There exists a special 
instance definition facility to ease the writing of lex- 
icon entries which differ from nor,hal types in that 
they are not entered into the type hierarchy. Input 
given to TD? is parsed by a Zebu-generated LALR(1) 
parser \[8\] to allow for an intuitive, hi9h-level input 
syntax and to abstract fi'om uninteresting details im- 
posed by the unifier and the underlying Lisp systenr. 
The kernel of TD?-. (and of most other monoton- 
ic systems) can be given a set-theoretical semantics 
Mong the lines of \[12\]. It is easy to translate TD?. 
statements into denotation-preserving expressions of 
Smolka's feature logic, thus viewing 7"D? only as syn- 
tactic sugar for a restricted (decidable) subset of first- 
order logic. Take for instance the following feature 
description O written as an attribute-vMue matrix: 
np 
\[ agr'eement \] 
?= A~\ [ \ ]  NUM sO 
PERS 3rd 
SUBJ \ [ \ ]  
It is not hard to rewrite this two-dimensionM de- 
scription to a flat first-order formula, where at- 
tributes/features (e.g., .~GR) are interpreted as binary 
relations and types (e.g., up) as unary predicates: 
3~. ,~p(?) A ,Ga(e,, ~) A ,,a,?~em~,,t(~) A 
RUM(x, sg) A PERS(x, o?7"(1) A SUBJ(?, x) 
The corresponding VD? type definition of ? looks as 
follows (actually &; is used on the keyboard instead 
of A, \[instead of V,~instead of ~): 
? := np A \[AGR #x A agreement A \[NUll st, PERS at'd\], 
SUBJ #~\]. 
3.2 Type  H ierarchy  
The type hierarchy is either called directly by the 
control machinery of TD? during the detinition of a 
type (type classification) or indirectly via the simpli- 
tier both at definition and at run time (type unifica- 
tion). 
3.2.1 Encod ing  Method  
The implementation f the type hierarchy is based 
on A'/t-Kaci's encoding technique for partial orders 
\[1\]. Every type t is assigned a code 7(t) (represented 
via a bit vector) such that 7(0 reflects tile reflexive 
transitive closure of the subsumption relation with 
respect to t. Decoding a code c is realized either 
by a look-up OFF 3t . 7-1(c) = t) or by computing 
the "maximal restriction" of the set of types whose 
codes are less than c. l)eper, ding on the encoding 
method, the hierarchy occupies O(n logn) (compact 
encoding) resp. O(n 2) (transitive closure encoding) 
bits. ltere, GLB/LUB operations directly correspond 
to bit-or/and instructions. GI,B, I, UB and ~ com- 
putations 1-1ave the nice property that they can be 
carried out in this tYamework in O(n), where n is the

cover the ol)en-world nature of avm types in thai; po- 
tential (\]I,I~/LUB cmMidates (calculated front their 
codes) must be verified. Why so'. e Take the. lbllowing

l)uring processing, one can definitely substitute y A z

because x' difl'ers fi'om f A z ' -  a/ is more speciiic as 
a coltseqtlellCX: of the l~e;~ture consl, r~t\[llt \[tt 1\]. So We 
make ;~ distinction between the "internal" gre;~test 
lower bound GI,B4, concerning only the type sub 
sumptiot~ relation i)y using Ait-Kaci's method alone 
(which is however used for sort types) and the :'ex- 
t(,rmq" one, GIA}c , which takes the subsumption re- 
lation over fi;ature structures into &(:COtlllt. 
With Gl,l)-< and GLIJc in mind, we (:m~_ define, a

alternatives !/ and z'. This distinction is represent- 
ed through tile use of different kinds of edges in the 
type graph (bold edges denote disjunction elements; 
see Fig. 3). But; it is worth noting that both of tllem 
express subsumption (x ~ y and x' >-_ y') and that 
the GLB/LUB operations must work properly over 
"conjunctive" as well as "disjunctive" subsumption 
links. 
TD? decomposes complex definitions consisting of 
A, V, and ~ by introducing intermediate types, so 
that the resulting expression is either a pure covjunc- 
lion or" a disjunction of type symbols. Intermediate 
type names are enclosed in vertical bars (ef. the in- 
termediate types \[u A v I and lu A v A w{ in Fig. 2). 
Tile same technique is applied when using ? (see 
Fig. 3). (b will be decomposed into A, V and ~, plus 
additional intermediates. For each negated tyt)e ~t, 
7"1)? introduces a new intermediate type symbol I-'tl 
having the definition ~t and dechu'es it incompatible 
with t (see Section 3.2.a). I,~ addition, if t is not 
already present, T/)? will add t as a new type to the 
hierarchy (see types \[~b\[ allcl \]-el in Fig. 3). 
Let's consider the example a := b ? c. The de- 
composition can be stated informally by the follow- 
ing rewrite steps (assuming that the user tu~s chosen 
CNF): 
a := bOc 
. := (~ A -~(-) v ( -~ A c) 
. := (b v -~b) A (b v c) A ( -~ V ~)  A (-,e V e) 
,, :=  (~ v e) A (~ v ~)  
. :=  I~vel A I~bWel 
3.2.3 Incompatible Types and Bottom 
Propagation 
Incompatible lypes lead to the introduction of spe- 
cialized bottom symbols (see Fig. 3 and 4) which how- 
ever are identified in the underlying logic in that they 
denote the empty set. These bottom symbols must be 
propagated ownwards by a mechanism called bottom 
propagation which takes place at definition time (see 
Fig. 4). Note that it is important o take not only 
subtypes of incompatible types into account but also 
disjunction elements as the following example shows: 
T 
-k(b, ~b\] J-{e,~c} 
Figure 3: Decomposing a := b?c, such that a inherits 
from tile intermediates IbVc\[ and b/ ,v~cl .  
.k -- a A b. } _~C+ a A bi := J- and a A b~ = J_ 
b := bl V b.). 
One might expect; that incompatibility statements 
together with feature term unification o longer lead 
to a monotonic, set-theoretical semantics. But this 
is not the case. To preserve monotonicity, one must 
assume a 2-level interpretation of tgpcd feature struc- 
tures, where feature constraints and t, ype constraints 
might denote diflb.rent sets of objects and the glob~ 
al interpretation is determined by the intersection of 
the two sets. Take for instance the type definitions 
A := \[a 1\] and 13 := \[b 1\], plus the user declaration 
J- = A A B, meaning that A and B are incompatible. 
Tl,en A A B will simplify to J_ although the corre- 
sponding feature structures of A and \[t successfully 
unify to \[a 1, b 1\], thus the global interpretation is ?. 
3.3 Symbo l i c  S impl i f ier  
\[File simplifier operates on arbitrary TD~ expressions. 
Simplitication is done at definition time and at run 
time when typed unification takes place (cf. \]rig. 1). 
The main issue of symbolic simplitication is to avoid 
(i) unnecessary feature constraint unification and (it) 
queries to the type hierarchy by simply applying 
"syntactic" reduction rules. Consider all expression 
like x~ A . . .  A xi . . . A "~a: i  , . . A xn. The shnplilier will 
detect .k by simply applying reduction rules. 
The simplification schemata re well known from 
the propositional calculus. They are hard-wired in 
the implementation to speed up computation. For- 
really, type simplitication in "FD? can be character- 
ized as a term rewriting system. A set of reduction 
rnles is applied until a normal form is reached. Con- 
fluence and termination is guaranteed by imposing 
a total generalized lexicwraphic order on terms (see 
below). In addition, this order has the nice effects 
of neglecting eommutativity (which is expensiw.' and 
might lead to termination problems): there is only 
one representative lbr a given formula. Therefore, 
memoizatiou is cheap and is employed in TD? to 
reuse precomputed results of simplilied expressions 
(one must not cover all permutations of a formula). 
Additional reduction rules are applied at run time 
using "semantic" inlbrmation of the type hierarchy 
(GLB, LUB, and ~).

? ECONOMY 
From the standpoint of efficiency, it; does make 
sense to work only with small, partially expand- 
ed structures (if possible) to speed up feature 
term unification and to reduce the antount of 
copying. At the end of processing however, one 
has to snake the result/constraints explicit. 
? ItECURSION 
l{ecursive types are inherently present in modern 
constraint-based granmlar theories like IIPSG 
which are not provided with a context-free back- 
bone. Moreover, if the formalism does not al- 
low fnnctionM or relational constraints, one tnust 
specify certain f lmctions/relations like append 
through recurslve types. Take for instance Ait- 
Kaci's version of the append type which (:ass be 
stated in "\]-DE as follows: 
append := appendo V appendl. 
aN)endo := \[FRONT < >, 
BACK #1A list, 
WHOLE #1\] .  
append, := \[FRONT < #first. #~v.stl >, 
BACK #back A list, 
WHOLE < #first. #rest2 >, 
PATCH append A \[FRONT #restl, 
BACK #back, 
WHOLE #rest2\]\]. 
o TYPE DEDUCTION 
Parsing and generation can be seen in the light of 
type deduction as a uniforin process, where ideal- 
ly only the phonology (for parsing) or the seman- 
tics (for generation) must be giw'.n. Type expan- 
sion together with a sufficiently specified gram- 
mar then is responsible in both cases for cov- 
strncting a fully specified feature structure which 
is maximal informative and compatible with the 
input. Itowever, \[la\] has shown that type ex- 
pansion without sophistieated control strategies 
is in Illany cases inelficient and moreover does 
not guarantee termination. 
3.4.2 Cont ro l led  Type. Ex l ians ion  
Uszkoreit \[la\] introduced a new strategy tbr lin- 
guistic processing called controlled linguistic deduc- 
lion. Ills approaeh permits the.specitication of lit> 
gnistic performance models without giving up the 
declarative basis of linguistie competence, especial- 
ly monotonicity and eompleteness. The ewduation of 
both cm0nnctive and disjunctive constraints can be 
controlled in this framework. For conjunctive con- 
straints, the one with the highest faihtre probability 
should be evahtated first. For disjunctive ones, a suc- 
cess measure is used instead: the alternative with the 
highest success probabil ity is used until a unification 
fails, in which case one has to backtrack to the next 
best alternative. 
7'D? and /./D~de snpport this strategy in that ev- 
ery feature structnre can be associated with its sue- 
cess/faihtre potentiM such that type expansion can be 
sensitive to these settings. Moreover, one can make 
other decisions as well during type expansion: 
? only regard structures which art subsumed by a 
given type resp. the opposite case (e.g., expand 
the type subcat-list always or never expand the 
type daughters) 
? take into &ccouttt only structures under cer- 
tain paths or again assume the oliposite case 
(e.g., always expand the wtlue nailer path 
SYNSEMILOCICAT; in addition, it is possible to 
employ path pattenls in the sense of pattern 
matching) 
? set the depth of type expansion for a given type 
Note that we are not restricted to apply only one 
of these settings-- they can be used in combination 
and can be changed dynamically during processing. 
It does make sense, tbr instance, to expand at cer- 
tain well-defined points during parsing the (partial) 
information obtained so far. If this will not resnlt in a 
failure, one can throw away (resp. store) this flflly ex- 
panded feature structure, working on with the older 
(and smaller) one. tlowever, if the information is in- 
consistent, we luust backtrack to older stages in com- 
putation. Going this way which of course assumes 
/seuristic knowledge (language as well as grammar- 
specific knowledge) results in faster processing and 
copying. Moreover, the inference ngine lllnst be able 
to handle possibly illconsistenl, knowledge, e.g., in 
cast of a chart parser to allow for a third kind of 
edge (besides active and passive ones). 
3.4.3 Reem's iw;  Types ,  hnp lenmntat iona l  
Issues,  and  Undee idab i l l ty  
The set of all recursive types of a given gram- 
mar/ lexicon can be precompiled by employing the 
dependency graph of this type system. This graph 
is updated every time a new type delhfition is added 
to the system. Thus detecting whether a given type 
is recnrsive or not reduces to a simple table look--up. 
ltowever l, he expansion of a recnrsive type itself is a 
little bit harder. In T'D?, we are using a lazy expan- 
sion technique whMt only makes those constraints 
explicit which are really new. To pslt it in anoth-. 
er way: if no (global or local) control information 
is specified to guide a specific expansion, a recnrsive 
type will be be expanded under all its paths (local 
plus inherited paths) until one reaches a point where 
the information is already given in a prcJi:r path. We 
call such an expanded structure a resolved typeil t?~.a - 
ture structure. Of course, there are inlinitely many 
resolved feature structures, but this structure is the 
most general resolved one. 
Take lbr instance the append example l?om the 
1)revions section, append is of course a recursive 
type because one of its alternatives, viz., append 1
uses append under the PATCH attrilmte. Exl)and- 
ing append with no additional information sup- 
plied (especiMly no path leading inside appcndl, 
e.g., PATCH I PATCH I PATCH) yields a disjunctive feature 
structure where both append o and append I are sub- 
stituted by their definitiorl. The expansion then stops 
if no other informatioll enforce a fisrther expansion. 
In practice, one has to keep track of the visited 
paths and visited typeil feature structures to avoid 
unnecessary expansion. 3'0 make expansion more el L 
ficient, we mark structures whether they are fully ex- 
panded or not. A feature strnetnre is then fully ex- 
panded iff all of its substructures are fully expanded. 
This simple idea leads to a massive reduction of the 
search space when dealing wills incremental expan- 
sion (e.g., during parsing). 
898 
It is worth noting that the sat|st|ability of fea- 
ture descript ions admi t t ing  recursive type equa- 
t ions/det in i t ions is in general undecidable. Rounds 
and Manaster- l l ,  aumr \[11\] were the tirst having shown 
that  a t(asper- l l .ounds logic enriched with recnrsive 
types allows one to encode it Tur ing machine, lie- 
cause our logic is much more richer, we imlne(l iately 
get; the sanle result tbr TD?. 
i towever, one can choose in 7"l)? between a com- 
plete expansion a lgor i thm which may not tern i inate 
and a non-comf)lete on(.' to guarantee tcrmin~-ttion (see 
\[2\] and \[5, Ch. 1,5\] for s imi lar prol,osals ). The latter 
ease heavily depends on the notion of resolvedness 
(see above). In both  cases, the depth of the search 
space can be restr icted by specifying a max imal  path 
length. 
4 Compar i son  w i th  o ther  Sys tems 
7'D/~ is tmique in that  it iml) lemevts many novel fea- 
tures not found in other systems like ALE \[4\], I,IFI'; 
\[2\], (7,: TIeS \[15\]. Of course, these systems l,rovide 
other l~atures whiclt are not present in our formal- 
|sin. What  makes 7,D? unique in COmlTarison to them 
is the d ist inct ion open vs. closed world, the awdlabil-  
ity of the full boolean connectives and distr ibuted 
dis junct ions (via UD/~) ,  as well as an imphmte,lted 
lazy type expansion mechaif ism for reeursive types 
(as compared with LIFE).  AI,E, \[br instance, neither 
allows d is |mint | re  nor recurs|re tyl)es and enforces 
the l;ype hierarchy to be a I?,CPO. IIowever, il; makes 
recursion available througl, detinite relations and in- 
corporates special mechanisms \[br eml)ty categories 
and lexical rules. TFS  comes up with a closed worhl, 
the unawdlabi l i ty  of negative in format ion (only im- 
plicitly present) and only a poor tbrm of dis junctive 
in format ion but  performs parsing and generat ion en- 
tirely through type deduct ion (in fact, it was the tirst 
system). LIF'I'3 comes closest to us but l)rovides a se- 
mant ics  for types that  is s imilar to TFS.  Moreover 
the lack of negative in format ion and distr ibuted dis- 
junct ions makes it again comparal) le with TFS.  L IFF  
as a whole can be seen as an extension of PROI,O(~ (as 
was the case for its predecessor LO('HN), where tirst- 
order terms are rel)laced by .~-terms. In this sense, 
I,IFF, is rMmr than onr fomal ism in that  it offers a 
fifll relat ional  calculus. 
5 Summary  and  Out look  
In this pal)er , we have presented 7,D?, a typed tha- 
ture for lnMism thg~t integrates a |)owerflfl feature con- 
strMnt solver and type system. 13oth of t\]tem provide 
the boolean connectives A, V, and ~, where a con> 
l)lex exl)ression is decomposed by emphTying interme- 
diate types. Moreover, recursive types are supported 
as well. lit 7,D/2, a grammar  writer decides whether 
types liw. ~ in an open or a closed world. This ef- 
fe.cts ( \]Lt l  and LIJI\] computat ions .  ' | 'he type system 
i~,self consists of several inference components,  each 
designed to cover etficiently a specific task: (i) a tilt 
vector encoding o\[ the hierarchy, (ii) a fast symbol ic 
simpli l ier for complex type expressions, (iii) memo 
ization t;(7 cache preeomI)uted results, and (iv) a so- 
phist icated type expansion nmchanism. The system 
as described in this paper has been implemented in 
COMMON IASP and integrated in tile I ) ISCO environ- 
men|  \[14\]. 
The next lll;kjor version of 7,D? will be integrat- 
ed into a declarat ive sl)ecilication langttage which al- 
lows l inguists to define eoutrol kuowledge that  can be 
nsed dur ing proe~.'ssing. In addit ion,  certain forms of 
know|edge, compi lat ion will be made availa/fle in fu- 
ture versions o\[' TD/~, e.g., the auto lnat ic  detection o\[' 
syntact ic ineonq)atibi l i t ies between tyl)es , so that  a 
type eOmlmtat ion can subsl, itute an extensive feature 
term unif ication.
