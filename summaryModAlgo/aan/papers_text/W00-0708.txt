Abst ract  
Article choice can pose difficult problems in ap- 
plications uch as machine translation and auto- 
mated summarization. In this paper, we investi- 
gate the use of corpus data to collect statistical 
generalizations about article use in English in 
order to be able to generate articles automati- 
cally to supplement a symbolic generator. We 
use data from the Penn Treebank as input to a 
memory-based learner (TiMBL 3.0; Daelemans 
et al, 2000) which predicts whether to gener- 
ate an article with respect o an English base 
noun phrase. We discuss competitive r sults ob- 
tained using a variety of lexical, syntactic and 
semantic features that play an important role in 
automated article generation. 
1 In t roduct ion  
Article choice can pose difficult problems in nat- 
ural language applications. Machine transla- 
tion (MT) is an example of such an applica- 
tion. When translating from a source language 
that lacks articles, such as Japanese or Rus- 
sian, to one that requires them, such as English 
or German, the system must somehow generate 
the source language articles (Bond and Ogura, 
1998). Similarly in automated summarization: 
when sentences or fragments are combined or 
reduced, it is possible that the form of a noun 
phrase (NP) is changed such that a change of 
the article associated with the NP's head be- 
comes necessary. For example, consider the sen- 
tences A talk will be given on Friday about NLP; 
The talk will last .for one hour which might get 
summarized as Friday's NLP talk will last one

hour. However, given the input sentences, it is 
not clear how to decide not to generate an arti- 
cle for the subject NP in the output sentence. 
Another important application is in the field 
known as augmentative and alternative com- 
munication (AAC). In particular, people who 
have lost the ability to speak sometimes use 
a text-to-speech generator as a prosthetic de- 
vice. But most disabilities which affect speech, 
such as stroke or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
(ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease), also cause some 
more general motor impairment, which means 
that prosthesis users cannot achieve a text in- 
put rate comparable to normal typing speeds 
even if they are able to use a keyboard. Many 
have to rely on a slower physical interface (head- 
stick, head-pointer, eye-tracker tc). We are at- 
tempting to use a range of NLP technology to 
improve text input speed for such users. Article 
choice is particularly important for this applica- 
tion: many AAC users drop articles and resort 
to a sort of telegraphese, but this causes degra- 
dation in comprehension f synthetic speech and 
contributes to its perception as unnatural and 
robot-like. Our particular goal is to be able to 
use an article generator in conjunction with a 
symbolic generator for AAC (Copestake, 1997; 
Carroll et al, 1999). 
In this paper we investigate the use of corpus 
data to collect statistical generalizations about 
article use in English so as to be able to gen- 
erate them automatically. We use data from 
the Penn Treebank as input to a memory-based 
learner (TiMBL 3.0; Daelemans et al, 2000) 
that is used to predict whether to generate the 
or alan or no article. 1 We discuss a variety 
of lexical, syntactic and semantic features that

generate a or an as  described in Minnen et al (2000).

play an important role in automated article gen- 
eration, and compare our results with other re- 
searchers'. 
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 
relates our work to that of others. Section 3 
introduces the features we use. Section 4 intro- 
duces the learning method we use. We discuss 
our results in Section 5 and suggest some di- 
rections for future research, then conclude with 
some final remarks in Section 6. 
2 Re la ted  Work  
There has been considerable research on gen- 
erating articles in machine translation sys- 
tems (Gawrofiska, 1990; Murata and Nagao, 
1993; Bond and Ogura, 1998; Heine, 1998). 
These systems use hand-written rules and lex- 
ical information to generate articles. The best 
cited results, 88% accuracy, are quoted by Heine 
(1998) which were obtained with respect o a 
very small corpus of 1,000 sentences in a re- 
stricted omain. 
Knight and Chander (1994) present an ap- 
proach that uses decision trees to determine 
whether to generate the or alan. They do not 
consider the possibility that no article should 
be generated. On the basis of a corpus of 400K 
NP instances derived from the Wall Street Jour- 
nal, they construct decision trees for the 1,600 
most frequent nouns by considering over 30,000 
lexical, syntactic and semantic features. They 
achieve an accuracy of 81% with respect to these 
nouns. By guessing the for the remainder of the 
nouns, they achieve an overall accuracy of 78%. 
3 Features  Determin ing  Automated  
Ar t i c le  Generat ion  
We have extracted 300K base noun phrases 
(NPs) from the Penn Treebank Wall Street 
Journal data (Bies et al, 1995) using the tgrep 
tool. The distribution of these NP instances 
with respect o articles is as follows: the 20.6%, 
a/an 9.4% and 70.0% with no article. 
We experimented with a range of features: 
1. Head of the NP: We consider as the head 
of the NP the rightmost noun in the NP. If an 
NP does not contain a noun, we take the last 
word in the NP as its head. 
2. Part-of-speech (PoS) tag of the head of 
the NP: PoS labels were taken from the Penn 
Treebank. We list the tags that occurred with 
(PP-DIR to/T0 
(NP the/DT problem/NN))

Street Journal data (300,744 NPs in all) 
3. Functional tag of the head of the NP: In 
the Penn Treebank each syntactic ategory can 
be associated with up to four functional tags as 
listed in Table 2. We consider the sequence of 
functional tags associated with the category of 
the NP as a feature; if a constituent has no func- 
tional tag, we give the feature the value NONE. 
4. Category of the constituent embedding the 
NP: We looked at the category of the embedding 
constituent. See Figure 1: The category of the 
constituent embedding the NP the problem is 
PP. 
5. Functional tag of the constituent 
embedding the NP: If the category of the con- 
stituent embedding the NP is associated with 
one or more functional tags, they are used as 
features. The functional tag of the constituent 
embedding the problem in Figure 1 is DIR. 
6. Other determiners of the NP: We looked 
at the presence of a determiner in the NP. By 
definition, an NP in the Penn Treebank can only

Table 2: Functional tags and their mean- 
ing (Santorini, 1990) 
have one determiner (Bies et al, 1995), so we 
expect it to be a good predictor of situations 
where we should not generate an article. 
7. Head countability preferences of the head 
of the NP: In case the head of an NP is a noun 
we also use its countability as a feature. We an- 
ticipate that this is a useful feature because sin- 
gular indefinite countable nouns normally take 
the article a/n, whereas singular indefinite un- 
countable nouns normally take no article: a dog 
vs water. We looked up the countability from 
the transfer lexicon used in the Japanese-to- 
English machine translation system ALT- J /E  
(Ikehara et al, 1991). We used six values for 
the countability feature: FC (fully countable) for 
nouns that have both singular and plural forms 
and can be directly modified by numerals and 
modifiers such as many; UC (uncountable) for 
nouns that have no plural form and can be mod- 
ified by much; SC (strongly countable) for nouns 
that are more often countable than uncount- 
able; WC (weakly countable) for nouns that are 
more often uncountable than countable; and PT 
(pluralia tantum) for nouns that only have plu- 
ral forms, such as for example, scissors (Bond 
et al, 1994). Finally, we used the value UNKNOWN 
if the lexicon did not provide countability infor- 
mation for a noun or if the head of the NP was 
not a noun. 41.4% of the NP instances received 
the value UNKNOWN for this feature. 
8. Semantic classes of the head of the NP: If 
the head of the NP is a noun we also take into 
account its semantic lassification in a large se- 
mantic hierarchy. The underlying idea is that 
the semantic lass of the noun can be used as a 
way to back off in case of unknown head nouns. 
The 2,710 node semantic hierarchy we used was 
also developed in the context of the ALT- J /E 
system (Ikehara et al, 1991). Edges in this hi- 
erarchy represent IS-A or HAS-A relationships. 
In case the semantic lasses associated with two 
nodes stand in the IS-A relation, the semantic 
class associated with the node highest in the hi- 
erarchy subsumes the semantic lass associated 
with the other node. 
Each of the nodes in this part of the hierarchy 
is represented by a boolean feature which is set 
to 1 if that node lies on the path from the root 
of the hierarchy to a particular semantic class. 
Thus, for example, the semantic features of a 
noun in the semantic class organization con- 
sists of a vector of 30 features where the features 
corresponding to the nodes noun, concrete ,  
agent and organization are set to I and all 
other features are set to 0. 2 
4 Memory-based  learn ing  
We used the Tilburg memory based learner 
TiMBL 3.0.1 (Daelemans et al, 2000) to learn 
from examples for generating articles using the 
features discussed above. Memory-based learn- 
ing reads all training instances into memory and 
classifies test instances by extrapolating a class 
from the most similar instance(s) in memory. 
Daelemans et al (1999) have shown that 
for typical natural language tasks, this ap- 
proach has the advantage that it also extrap- 
olates from exceptional and low-frequency in- 
stances. In addition, as a result of automat- 
ically weighing features in the similarity func- 
tion used to determine the class of a test in- 
stance, it allows the user to incorporate large 
2If a noun has multiple senses, we collapse them by 
taking the semantic lasses of a noun to be the union of 
the semantic lasses of all its senses.

numbers of features from heterogeneous sources: 
When data is sparse, feature weighing embod- 
ies a smoothing-by-similarity effect (Zavrel and 
Daelemans, 1997). 
5 Evaluat ion and Discuss ion 
We tested the features discussed in section 3 
with respect o a number of different memory- 
based learning methods as implemented in the 
TiMBL system (Daelemans et al, 2000). 
We considered two different learning algo- 
rithms. The first, IB1 is a k-nearest neighbour 
algorithm. 3 This can be used with two differ- 
ent metrics to judge the distance between the 
examples: overlap and modified value difference 
metric (MVDM). TiMBL automatically learns 
weights for the features, using one of five dif- 
ferent weighting methods: no weighting, gain 
ratio, information gain, chi-squared and shared 
variance. The second algorithm, IGTREE, stores 
examples in a tree which is pruned according 
to the weightings. This makes it much faster 
and of comparable accuracy. The results for 
these different methods, for k = 1, 4, 16 are dis- 
played in Table 3. IB1 is tested with leave-one- 
out cross-validation, IGTREE with ten-fold cross 
validation. 
The best results were (82.6%) for IB1 with 
the MVDM metric, and either no weighting or 
weighting by gain ratio. IGTREE did not per- 
form as well. We investigated more values of k, 
from 1 to 200, and found they had little influ- 
ence on the accuracy results with k = 4 or 5 
performing slightly better. 
We also tested each of the features described 
in Section 3 in isolation and then all together. 
We used the best performing algorithm from our 
earlier experiment: IB1 with MVDM, gain ratio 
and k = 4. The results of this are given in 
Table 4. 
When interpreting these results it is impor- 
tant to recall the figures provided in Table 1. 
The most common article, for any PoS, was no 
and for many PoS, including pronouns, gener- 
ating no article is always correct. There is more 
variation in NPs headed by common ouns and 
adjectives, and a little in NPs headed by proper 
nouns. Our baseline therefore consists of never

rithm, which looks at all examples in the nearest k dis- 
tances, the number of which may be greater than k.

Table 4: Accuracy results by feature 
generating an article: this will be right in 70.0% 
of all cases. 
Looking at the figures in Table 4, we see that 
many of the features investigated id not im- 
prove results above the baseline. Using the head 
of the NP itself to predict the article gave the 
best results of any single feature, raising the ac- 
curacy to 79.4%. The functional tag of the head 
of the NP itself improved results slightly. The 
use of the semantic lasses (72.1%) clearly im- 
proves the results over the baseline thereby indi- 
cating that they capture useful generalizations. 
The results from testing the features in com- 
bination are shown in Table 5. Interestingly, 
features which were not useful on their own, 
proved useful in combination with the head 
noun. The most useful features appear to be the 
category of the embedding constituent (81.1%) 
and the presence or absence of a determiner 
(80.9%). Combining all the features gave an 
accuracy of 82.9%.

Table 3: Accuracy results broken down with respect o memory-based learning methods used 
also improve significantly upon earlier esults of 
78% as reported by Knight and Chander (1994), 
which in any case is a simpler task since it only 
involved choice between the and alan. Further, 
our results are competitive with state of the art 
rule-based systems. Because different corpora 
are used to obtain the various results reported 
in the literature and the problem is often de- 
fined differently, detailed comparison is difficult. 
However, the accuracy achieved appears to ap- 
proach the accuracy results achieved with hand- 
written rules. 
In order to test the effect of the size of the 
training data, we tested used the best perform- 
ing algorithm from our earlier experiment (IB1 
with MVDM, gain ratio and k = 4) on various 
subsets of the corpus: the first 10%, the first 
20%, the first 30% and so on to the whole cor- 
pus. The results are given in Table 6.

90% 83.45% 
100% 83.58% 
(100% is 300,744 NPs) 
Table 6: Accuracy versus Size of Training Data 
The accuracy is still improving even with 
300,744 NPs, an even larger corpus should give 
even better results. It is important to keep in 
mind that we, like most other researchers, have 
been training and testing on a relatively homo- 
geneous corpus. Furthermore, we took as given 
information about the number of the NP. In 
many applications we will have neither a large 
amount of homogeneous training data nor infor- 
mation about number. 
5.1 Future  Work  
In the near future we intend to further ex- 
tend our approach in various directions. First, 
we plan to investigate other lexical and syn- 
tactic features that might further improve our 
results, such as the existence of pre-modifiers 
like superlative and comparative adjectives, and 
post-modifiers like prepositional phrases, rela- 
tive clauses, and so on. We would also like to in- 
vestigate the effect of additional discourse-based 
features uch as one that incorporates informa- 
tion about whether the referent of a noun phrase 
has been mentioned before. 
Second, we intend to make sure that the fea- 
tures we are using in training and testing will 
be available in the applications we consider. For 
example, in machine translation, the input noun 
phrase may be all dogs, whereas the output 
could be either all dogs or all the dogs. At 
present, words such as all, both, half in our in- 
put are tagged as pre-determiners if there is a 
following determiner (it can only be the or a 
possessive), and determiners if there is no arti- 
cle. To train for a realistic application we need 
to collapse the determiner and pre-determiner 
inputs together in our training data. 
Furthermore, we are interested in training 
on corpora with less markup, like the British 
National Corpus (Burnard, 1995) or even no 
markup at all. By running a PoS tagger and 
then an NP chunker, we should be able to get 
a lot more training data, and thus significantly 
improve our coverage. If we can use plain text 
47 
to train on, then it will be easier to adapt our 
tool quickly to new domains, for which there are 
unlikely to be fully marked up corpora. 
6 Conc lud ing  remarks  
We described a memory-based approach to au- 
tomated article generation that uses a variety of 
lexical, syntactic and semantic features as pro- 
vided by the Penn Treebank Wall Street Jour- 
nal data and a large hand-encoded MT dictio- 
nary. With this approach we achieve an accu- 
racy of 82.6%. We believe that this approach 
is an encouraging first step towards a statistical 
device for automated article generation that can 
be used in a range of applications uch as speech 
prosthesis, machine translation and automated 
summarization.
