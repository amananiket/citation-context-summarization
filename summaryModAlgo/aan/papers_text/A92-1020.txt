Abstract 
The paper eports on a new approach to automatic 
generation of back-of-book indexes for Chinese 
books. Parsing on the level of complete sentential 
analysis i  avoided because of the inefficiency and 
unavailability ofa Chinese Grammar with enough 
coverage. Instead, fundamental analysis particular 
to Chinese text called word segmentation is 
performed to break up characters into a sequence 
of lexical units equivalent to words in English. 
The sequence of words then goes through part-of- 
speech tagging and noun phrase analysis. All these 
analyses are done using a corpus-based statistical 
algorithm. Experimental results have shown 
satisfactory esults. 
I. Introduction 
Preparing back-of-book indexes is of vital importance to 
the publishing industry but is a very labor intensive task. 
Attempts have been made over the years to automate this 
procedure for the apparent benefits of cost saving, shorter 
preparation time, and possibility of producing more 
complete and consistent indexes. Early work involves 
using occurrence characteristics of contents words \[Borko, 
1970\]. Later people came to realize that indexes are often 
multi-word terms and their generation might involve more 
elaborated syntactic analysis on phrasal or sentential level 
\[Salton, 1988; Dillon and McDonald, 1983\]. However, a 
full syntactical pproach \[Salton, 1988\] to this task has real 
problem with efficiency and coverage for unrestricted text. 
No viable automatic solution is currently in use. 
Indexing Chinese books involves another severe 
obstacle, namely the word segmentation problem. Chinese 
text consists of a sequence of characters which roughly

Council under Contract NSC 81-0408-E-007-529. 
correspond to letters in English. However, there are no 
spaces to mark the beginning and end of a word as in 
English. Until recently, this problem has been considered 
difficult to solve without elaborated syntactical and 
semantic analyses \[Chen, 1988\]. 
Recent research advances may lead to the development 
of viable book indexing methods for Chinese books. These 
include the availability of efficient and high precision word 
segmentation methods for Chinese text \[Chang et al, 1991; 
Sproat and Shih, 1990; Wang et al, 1990\], the availability 
of statistical analysis of a Chinese corpus \[Liu et al, 1975\] 
and large-scale lectronic Chinese dictionaries with part- 
of-speech information \[Chang et al, 1988; BDC, 1992\], 
the corpus-based statistical part-of-speech tagger \[Church, 
1988; DeRose, 1988; Beale, 1988\], as well as phrasal and 
clausal analyzers \[Church 1988; Ejerhed 1990\] 
2. Problem description 
As being pointed out in \[Salton, 1988\], back-of-book 
indexes may consist of more than one word that are 
derived from a noun phrase. Given the text of a book, an 
indexing system, must perform some kind of phrasal and 
statistical analysis in order to produce a list of candidate 
indexes and their occurrence statistics in order to generate 
indexes as shown in Figure 1 which is an excerpt from the 
reconstruction of indexes of a book on transformational 
grammar for Mandarin Chinese \[Tang, 1977\]. 
Before phrasal analysis can be performed, the text must 
go through the more fundamental morphological nd part- 
of-speech analysis. The morphological analysis for 
Chinese text is mainly a so-called word segmentation 
process, which segments a sequence of Chinese character 
into a sequence of words. See Figure 2 for illustration. 
The noun phrase generation process described in this 
paper is based on a corpus-based statistical analysis and 
does not use an explicit syntactical representation. 
Examples of noun phrases found are underlined as shown 
in Figure 2.

The constraint satisfaction problem 
The constraint satisfaction problem involves the 
assignment of values to variables subject to a set of 
constraining relations. Examples of CSPs include map 
coloring, understanding line drawing, and scheduling 
\[Detcher and Pear, 1988\]. The CSP with binary constraints 
can be defined as follows: Given a set of n variables XI, 
X2 . . . .  , Xn and a set of binary constraints Kij, find all 
possible n-tuples (Xl, x2 ..... Xn) such that each n-tuple is 
an instantiation of the n variables atisfying 
(~, x\]) in Kij, for all Kij 
3.1. Word Segmentation 
Segmentation through Constraint Satisfaction 
The word segmentation problem for Chinese can be 
simply stated as follows: Given a Chinese sentence, 
segment the sentence into words. For example, given 
we are supposed to segment i into 
\[ba/liuxianzhong/de/queshi/xiendong/cuo/le/fenxi\] 
Xian-Zhong Liu's exact action was given an analysis. 
where ~q (Liu) is a surname and ~ (Xian-Zhong) is a 
last name. In the following, we will describe a method that 
extends our previous work on segmentation \[Chang et al, 
1991a\] to handle surname-names \[Chang et al, 1991b\]. 
Segmentation is solved as a constraint satisfaction 
problem. 
Segmentation as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem 
The word segmentation problem can be cast as a CSP as 
follows: Suppose that we are given a sequence of Chinese 
character (C1, C2 ...... Cn) and are to segment the sequence 
into subsequences of characters that are either words in the 
dictionary or surname-names. We can think of a solution to 
this segmentation problem as an assignment of 
break~continue (denoted by the symbols '>' and '=' 
respectively) to each place X i between two adjacent 
characters Ci and Ci+l: 
ICl  IC21 Ca ... I Cnl 
Xo x l  X2 ... Xn-l Xn 
subject o the constraint that the characters between two 
closest breaks correspond to either a Chinese word in the 
dictionary or surname-names. (For convenience, we add 
two more places; one at the beginning, the other at the 
end.) So the set of constraints can be constructed as 
follows: 
148
For each sequence of characters Ci ..... Cj, (j >= i) which 
are a Chinese word in the dictionary or a suruame-name, 
ifj = i, then put (>,>) in Ki-l,i. 
ifj > i, then put (>,=) in Ki-l,i, (=,=) in Ki,i+l ..... and 
(=,>) in Kj-1 ,j. 
For example, consider again the following: 
The corresponding CSP is 
since 
K0,1 = {(>,>)}, 
/(1,2 = {(>,=)}, 
K2,3 = {(=,>),(=,=)}, 
K3,4 = {(=,>)}, 
K4,5 = {(>,>)}, 
K5,6 = {(>,>)}, 
/<6,7 = {(>,>),(>,=)}, 
/(7,8 = {(>,>),(=,>),(>,=)}, 
/<8,9 = {(>,>),(=,>),(>,=)}, 
/ (9,10 = {(>,>),(=,>),(>,=)}, 
/(10,11 = {(>,>),(=,>),(>,=)}, 
/ (11,12 = {(>,>)}, 
/ (12,13 = {(>,>),(>,=)}, 
/ (13,14 = {(=,>)}, 
~?i~1~4~1~'~17 I lmsilTI 
are either words in the dictionary or probable surname- 
names (hypothesized words). 
Typically, there will be more than one solution to this 
CSP. So the most probable one with highest product of 
probability of hypothesized words is chosen to be the 
solution. Ordinary words are listed in the dictionary along 
with this kind of probability estimated from a general 
corpus \[Liu et al, 1975\]. As for proper names such as 
Chinese surname-names not listed in the dictionary, their 
probability are approximated by using another corpus 
containing more than 18,000 names as described in the 
following subsection. 
The Problem with Proper Names in Chinese Text 
Proper nouns account for only about 2% of average 
Chinese text. However, according to a recent study on 
word segmentation \[Chang et al, 1991a\], they account for 
at least 50% of errors made by a typical segmentation 
system. Moreover, proper names are oftentimes indexes. 
Therefore their correct segmentation is crucial to automatic 
generation of back-of-book indexes. 
The difficulties involved in handling proper names are 
due to the following: (1) No apparent punctuation marking 
is given like capitalization in English. (2). Most of 
characters in proper names have different usage. So this 
problem has been held impossible to solve in the 
segmentation process. And it was suggested that proper 
names are best left untouched in the segmentation process 
and rely on syntactical and semantic analysis to solve the 
problem when nothing can be made out of the characters 
representing them \[Chen, 1988\]. Using the corpus-based 
statistical approach, we have shown that it is possible to 
identify most Chinese surname-names (~ ~fi) without using 
explicit syntactical or semantic representation. 
Most surnames are single character and some rare ones 
are of two characters (single-surnames and double- 
surnames). Names can be either one or two characters 
(single-names and double-names). Some characters are 
more often used for names than others. Currently, there 
are more double-names than single-name in Taiwan. 
The formation of hypothesized surname-names i
triggered by the recognition of a surname. In the example 
above, ~r\] (Liu) is one of some 300 surnames. 
Subsequently, we will take one character and two 
characters after the surname as probable last names, in this 
case ~ (Xian) and ~ ~q~ (Xian-Zhong). A general corpus, 
G and a surname-name corpus N are used to evaluate the 
probability of a surname-name. For instance, the 
probability of a most common kind of 3-character name 
(single-surname/double-name) such as J\[IJ~ ~ is : 
p( ~rJ~ ~, ) = p( single-surname/double-names in G) x 
p(~rJ being a surname in N) x 
P (~ being 1 st character in names in N) x 
P({~ being 2nd character in names in N) 
Names of other combinations can be handled similarly. 
The Algorithm 
To sum up, the whole process of word segmentation with 
surname-name identification is as follows: 
1, Scan from left to right across the sentence 
2. Check to see if the prefix of what is being scanned 
is a hypothesize word, by 
2.1. dictionary lookup of an ordinary word and its 
probability 
2.2. checking for the existence of a surname 
2.2.1. forming possible combinations of the 
surname-name 
2.2.2. evaluating the probability of each combination 
3. Post the constraints of the CSP and probability for 
each hypothesized word 
4. Solve the CSP 
5. Find the most probable solution to CSP through 
dynamic programming 
3.2. Part-of-speech Tagging 
As far as we know, there has been only scarce research 
done on part-of-speech tagging for Chinese \[Chang et al, 
1988; Chen, 1991; Bai and Xia, 1991; BDC, 1992\]. As for 
English, there are at least three independently developed 
1Af~ 149
taggers \[Church 1988; DeRose 1988; Beale 1988\]. We 
started out using an electronic dictionary \[Chen; 1991; 
Chang et al, 1988\] with a very elaborated part-of-speech 
system based on Chao's work \[Chao, 1968\]. Because it is 
difficult o get sufficient manualy tagged ata for a large 
tag set, we have since switched to another electronic 
dictionary with some 90,000 entries and a much smaller 
tag set. The dictionary is actually abilingual one (Chinese- 
English) developed by Behavior Design Corporation 
\[BDC, 1992\]. The list of part-of-speeches is shown in 
Figure 3. The algorithm is essentially the same as 
\[DeRose, 1988\]. The BDC Chinese-English Dictionary is 
used to obtain the list of possible part-of-speeches for each 
segmented word. Currently, the collocation probabilities 
of part-of-speech are estimated from a manually tagged 
text of about 4,000 words. 
3.3. Finding Noun Phrases 
Instead of using a full-blown parser to find noun phrases, 
we first mark the noun phrases in the same text of about 
4,000 words and compute the statistical characteristics of
categoric patterns of noun phrase and then use the statistics 
in a stochastic algorithm for finding noun phrases in a 
manner similar to \[Church 1988; Ejerhed 1990\]. 
Extracting keywords from a noun phrase is somewhat 
heuristic unlike the rigorous approach of using the 
syntactical structure within the noun phrase in \[Salton, 
1988\]. 
4. The Experimental Results 
The algorithm described in Section 3 is currently under 
development and the programs are written in C and 
ProFox, and run on an IBM PC compatible machine. The 
segmentation, tagging, and NP identification parts are 
completed, while the statistical analysis of the occurrence 
of NPs is being implemented now. The statistics used in 
the system consists of four parts: 
(S1) Appearance counts of 40,032 distinct words 
from a corpus of 1,000,000 words of Chinese text 
\[Liu el al., 1975\]. 
($2) The BDC Chinese-English Dictionary \[BDC, 
1992\]. 
($3) A general corpus of 300,000 words. Some 
4,000 words of text from this corpus is tagged and 
marked with NP. 
($4) A name corpus of some 18,000 surname- 
names. 
The performance of the completed parts of the system is 
as follows: The hit rate of word segmentation is about 97% 
on the average. For the surname-names alone, we get 90% 
average hit rate which eliminate about 40% of errors 
produced by our previous egmentation system. About 98% 
of part-of-speeches are tagged correctly. And about 95% of 
the noun phrases are found successfully. 
5. Concluding Remarks 
The preliminary results that we have obtained seem very 
promising. The approach presented here does not rely on a 
fully developed Chinese grammar for syntactical nalysis 
on the sentential level. Thus the efficiency in system 
development and generation of indexes is reasonable and 
cost of building and maintaining such a system is 
acceptable. Currently, we are working on (1) handling 
translated names, (2) improving the hit rate of tagging and 
NP identification by using a larger and more correctly 
tagged and marked training corpus, and (3) completion of 
the statistical analysis of occurrence of noun phrases.
