Abstract 
This paper presents a constraint logic programming 
language cu-Prolog and introduces a simple Japanese 
parser based on Japanese Phrase Structure Grammar 
(JPSG) as a suitable application of cu-Prolog. 
cu-Prolog adopts constraint unification i stead of 
the normal Prolog unification. In cu-Prolog, con- 
straints in terms of user defined predicates can be 
directly added to the program clauses. Such a clause 
is called Constraint Added Horn Clause (CAHC}. 
Unlike conventional CLP systems, cu-Prolog deals 
with constraints about symbolic or combinatorial ob- 
jects. For natural anguage processing, such con- 
straints are more important than those on numeri- 
cal or boolean objects. In comparison with normal 
Prolog, cu-Prolog has more descriptive power, and is 
more declarative. It enables a natural implementa- 
tion of JPSG and other unification based grammar 
formalisms.

1 Introduction 
Prolog is frequently used in implementing natural 
language parsers or generators based on unification 
based grammars. This is because Prolog is also 
based on unification, and therefore has a declarative 
feature. One important characteristic of unification 
based grammar is also a declarative grammar formal- 
ization \[11\]. 
However, Prolog does not have sufficient power of 
expressing constraints because it executes every parts 
of its programs as procedures and because every vari- 
able of Prolog can be instantiated with any objects. 
Hence, the constraints in unification based grammar 
are forced to be implemented not declaratively but 
procedurally. 
We developed a new constraint logic programming 
language cu-Prolog which is free from this defect of 
traditional Prolog \[13\]. In cu-Prolog, user defined 
constraints can be directly added to a program clause 
(constraint added Horn clause), and the constraint 
unification \[12, 8\] 1 is adopted instead of the nor-

"conditioned unification."

mal unification. This paper discusses the outline of 
the cu-Prolog system, and presents a Japanese parser 
based on :IPSG (Japanese Phrase Structure Gram- 
mar) \[7\] as a suitable application of cu-Prolog. 
2 Const ra in t  Added Horn  
C lause  (CAHC)  
Most of the constraint logic programming language 
systems (CAL \[2\], PrologIII \[5\], etc.) deal with con- 
straints about algebraic equations, i.e., constraints 
about numerical domains, such as that of real num- 
bers etc. 
However, in the problems arising in Artificial In- 
telligence, constraints on symbolic or combinatorial 
objects are far more important han those on nu- 
merical objects, cu-Prolog handles constraints de- 
scribed in terms of sequence of atomic formulas of 
Prolog. The program clauses of cu-Prolog are fol- 
lowing type, which we call Constraint Added Horn 
Clauses (CAHCs): 
1. H : -  Bt ,B2, . . . ,Bn;C1,C2, . . . ,Cm. 
(H is called the head, B1, B2,... ,Bn is the 
body, C1, C2,. . . ,  Cm is the constraint. The 
body and the constraint can be empty.) 
C1,C2,.. . ,Cm comprise a set of constraints on 
the variables occurring in the rest of the clause. 
C1, C2,. . . ,  Crn must be, in the current implementa- 
tion, modular in the sense that it has the following 
canonical form. 
\[Def.\] 1 (modular)  A sequence of atomic formulas 
C1, C2,... ,  Cm is modular when 
1. every arguments of Ci is variable, and 
~. no variable occurs in two distinct places, and 
3. the predicate of Ci is modularly defined (1 < i < 
m). 
\[Def.\] 2 (modular ly defined) Predicate p is mod- 
ularly defined, when in every definition clause of p, 
PI : --D., 
D is empty, 
or  
1. every argument of D is variable, 
~. no variable occurs in two distinct space, and 
3. every predicate occurring in D is p or modularly 
defined. 
For example, 
member(X, Y), member(U, V) is modular, 
member(X, Y), member(Y, Z) is not modu- 
lar, and 
append(X, Y, \[a, b, e, a~) is not modular. 
Seen from the declarative semantics, the program 
clause of cu-Prolog is equivalent to the following pro- 
gram clause of Prolog: 
1. H : -  B1,B2,. . . ,B~,C1,C2,. . . ,Cm. 
3 cu-Pro log  
3.1 Const ra in t  Un i f i ca t ion  
cu-Prolog employs Constraint Unification \[12, 8\] 
which is the usual Prolog unification plus constraint 
transformation ( ormalization). 
Using constraint unification, the inference rule of 
cu-Prolog is as follows: 
Q, R; C. , Q' : -S ;  D., 
0 = mgu(Q, Q'), B = my(co,  DO) 
$0, R6; B 
(Q is an atomic formula. R, C, S, D, 
and B are sequences of atomic formulas. 
mgu(Q,Q I) is a most general unifier be- 
tween Q and Q'.) 
my(C1,...,Cm) is a modular constraint which is 
equivalent to C1,.. ?, Cm. If C1, . . . ,  Cm is inconsis- 
tent, my(C1,. . . ,  Cm) is not defined. In this case, the 
above inference rule is inapplicable. 
- 96 - 
For example, 
mr(member(X, \[a, b, d), member(X, \[b, c, d\]) ) 
returns a new constraint cO(X), where the definition 
of cO is 
cO(b). 
c0(c). 
and 
mr(member(X, \[a, b, 4), member(X, \[k, l, m\])) 
is not undefined. 
This transformation is done by repeating un- 
fold/fold transformations as described later. 
3.2 Compar i son  w i th  convent iona l  ap-  
p roaches  
In normal Prolog, constraints are inserted in a goal 
and processed as procedures. It is not desirable for a 
declarative programming language, and the execution 
can be ineffective when constraints are inserted in a 
insufficient place. 
As constraints are rewritten at every unification, 
cu-Prolog has more powerful descriptive ability than 
the bind-hook technique. For example, freeze in Pro- 
log II\[4\] can impose constraints on one variable, so 
that when the variable is instantiated, the constraints 
are executed as a procedure. Freeze has, however, 
two disadvantages. First, freeze cannot impose a con- 
straint on plural variables at one time. For example, 
it cannot express the following CAHC. 
f(X), g(Y, Z); append(X, Y, Z). 
Second, since the contradiction between constraints is 
not detected until the variable is instantiated, there 
is a possibility of executing useless computation i
constraints deadlocking. For example, X and Y are 
unifiable ven after executing 
and 
f reeze(X,  member(X, \[a, hi)) 
freeze(Y, member(Y, \[u, v\])) 
In cu-Prolog, 
and 
f(x); member(X, \[a, hi). 2 
I(Y); member(Y, \[u, \]). 
are not unifiable. 
3.3 Const ra in t  T rans format ion  
This subsection explains the mechanism ofconstraint 
transformation in cu-Prolog. 
Let 7" be definition clauses of modularly defined 
constraints, ~ be a set of constraints {C1,..., Cn} 
that contains variables zl, ... ,zm, and p be a new 
m-ary predicate. 
Let D be definition clauses of new predicates, and 
~o = TU~)  
is initially 
{p(xl, . . . ,  xm): -C1 , . . . ,  C,.} 
and other new predicates are included through the 
constraint normalization. 
Then, mf(~) returns p(zl,..., zm), if there exists 
a sequence of program clauses 
:P0, Pl,... ,~', 
and :Pn is modularly defined, where Pi+1 is derived 
from Pi (0 < i < n) by one of the following three 
types of transformations. 
1. unfold transformation 
Select one clause C from Pi and one atomic for- 
mulaA from the body of C. Let C1, . . . ,  Cn be all 
the clauses whose heads unify with A, and C~ be 
the result of applying Cj to A of C (j = 1,..., n). 
7~+x is obtained by replacing C in :Pi with 
q, . . . , c - .  
:~rnember(X,\[a,b D is not modular, but is equivalent to 
pI(X), where 
pl(~). 
p2(b). 
- 97 - 
2. fold transformation 
Let C(A : -K&L.) be a clause in Pi, and D(B : 
-K ' . )  be a clause in :D, and 0 be mgu(K, K') 
that meets the following conditions. 
(a) No variables occur in both K and L, and 
(b) C is not contained in 7). 
Then, 7~i+t is obtained by replacing C in :Pi with 
AO :-BO&L. 
. integration 
Let C (H : -B&R.) be a clause in :Pi, where B 
is not modular and contains variables z l , . . . ,  zm 
and there are no common variables between B
and R. Let p be a new m-ary predicate and the 
following clause E: 
p(z l , . . . ,  z~)  : -B .  
be the definition ofp. Then, :Pi+l is obtained by 
replacing C in :Pi with 
H : -p (X l  . . . .  , zm)~R.  
and adding E. E is also added to :D. 
The third transformation can be seen as a special 
case of fold transformation. Hence, these three trans- 
formations preserve the semantics of programs be- 
cause unfold/fold transformation has been proved as 
valid \[6\]. ' 
The following example shows a transformation f 
member(A, Z), append(X, Y, Z). 
Here, T is { T1,T2,T3,T4 }, where 
T1 = member(X,\[X\[Y\]). 
T2 = member(X,\[Y\[Z\]):-member(X,Z). 
T3 = append(\[\],X,X). 
T4 = append(\[AIX\],Y,\[AIZ\]):-append(X,Y,Z). 
and E is {member(A, Z), append(X, Y, Z)}. The new 
predicate pl is defined as 
DI: p1(A,X,Y,Z):-member(A,Z),append(X,Y,Z). 
and 
P0 = {T I ,T2 ,Z3 ,T4 ,D1},~ = {D1} 
Unfolding the first formula of Dl's body, we get 
T5 = pI(A,X,Y, \[AIZ\]) :-append(X,Y, \[AIZ\]). 
T6 = pI(A,X,Y, \[BJZ\]) :-member,(A,Z), 
append (X, Y, \[B J Z/). 
So 
~Pl -- {T1,T2,T3,T4,TS,T6} 
By integration, 
T6' = pI(A,X,Y,\[AJZ3):-p2(X,Y,A,Z). 
T6' = pI(A.X,Y,\[BIZ3):-p3(A,Z,X,Y,B). 
D2 = p2(X,Y,A,Z):-append(X,Y, \[AIZ\]). 
D3 = p3(A,Z,X,Y,B):- 
member (A, Z), append (X, Y, \[B \[ Z/). 
and 
~)2 -- {TI, T2, T3, T4, TS', T6', D2, D3} 
~) = {D1,D2,D3} 
By unfolding D2, 
T7 = p2(\[\],\[AIZ\],A,Z). 
T8 = p2(\[BIX\] ,Y,A,Z) :-append(X,Y,Z). 
These clauses comprise the modular definition of p2. 
Thus 
"P3 = {T1, T2, T3, T4, T5', T6', TT, T8, D3}. 
Unfold the second definition of D3, and we have 
T9 = p3(A,Z, \[ \ ] ,  \[B\[Z\] ,B) :-member(k,Z). 
TIO = p3(A,Z, \[BIX\],Y,B):- 
member (A, Z) ,append(X,Y,Z). 
~9 4 = {T1, T2, T3, T4, T5 I, T6', TT, T8, Tg, TIO}. 
Folding TIO by D1 will generate 
TIO' = p3(A,Z,EBIX3,Y,B):-pI(A,X,Y,Z). 
Accordingly 
"P5 = {T1, T2, T3, T4, TS', T6', T7, T8, T9, TIO'}. 
- 9S  - 
As a result, 
member(A, Z), append(X, Y, Z) 
has been transformed to pl(A,X,Y,Z) preserving 
equivalefice, and the following new clauses have been 
defined. 
{T4, T5 I, T6 I, T7, T8, T9, TlOI}. 
3.4 Imp lementat ion  
The source code of cu-Prolog is, at present (Vet 2.0), 
composed o f  4,500 lines of language C on UNIX sys- 
tem. Its precise computation speed is under evalua- 
tion, but is sufficient for practical use. 
Implementation of the effective constraint rans- 
formation shown in above subsection requires ome 
heuristics in the application of three transformation. 
Especially, in unfold transformation, one atomic for- 
mula A is selected in the following heuristic rules 
1. The atomic formula of the finite predicate. 
2. The atomic formula that has constants or \[ \] in 
its arguments. 
3. The atomic formula that has lists in its argu- 
ment. 
4. The atomic formula that has plural dependen- 
cies. 
Here, 
\[Def.\] 3 (finite predicate) A predicate p is finite, 
when the body of every definition clause of p is 
.

4 A JPSG parser  
As an application of cu-Prolog, a natural language 
parser based on unification based grammar has been 
considered first of all. Since constraints can be added 
directly to the program clause representing a lexi- 
cal entry or a phrase structure rule, the grammar is 
implemented more naturally and declaratively than 
with ordinary Prolog. Here we describe a simple 
Japanese parser of JPSG in cu-Prolog. CAHC plays 
an important role in two respects. 
First, CAHC is used in the lexicon of homonyms 
or polysemic words. For example, a Japanese noun 
"hasi" is 3-way ambiguous, it means a bridge, chop- 
sticks, or an edge. This polysemic word can be sub- 
sumed in the following single lexical entry. 
lezieon(\[hasilX\], X, \[... semS EM\]); 
hasi_sem( S E M ). 
where hasi_sem is defined as follows. 
hasi.sem( bridge ). 
hasi.sem( ehopst icks ). 
hasi.sem(edge). 
The value of the semantic feature is a vari- 
able (SEM), and the constraint on SEM is 
hasi_sem(SEM). Note that predicate hasi_sem is 
modularly defined. According to CAHC, such ambi- 
guity may be considered at one time, instead of being 
divided in separate lexical entries. Japanese has such 
an ambiguity is also shown in conjugation, post po- 
sitions, etc. They can be treated in this manner. 
Second, a phrase structure rule is written naturally 
in a CAHC. In JPSG \[7\], FFP(FOOT Feature Prin- 
ciple) is: 
The value of a FOOT feature of the mother 
unifies with the union of those of her daugh- 
ters. 
This principle is embedded in a phrase structure 
rule as follows: 
psr(\[slashM S\], \[slashLDb~, \[slashRDS\]); 
union( LD S, RD S, MS). 
However, this cannot be described in this manner in 
traditional Prolog. 
- 99 - 
.member(I,\[IIY\]). 
.member(I,\[YlZ\]):-member(I,Z). 
.append(\[ \ ] , I , I ) .  
.append(\[lll\],Y,\[AIZ\]):-append(X,Y,Z). 
.@ member(I,\[ga,eo,nt\]),member(X,\[no,eo,nt\]). 
so lu t ion  = cO(I) 
cl( .o) .  
c l (n i ) .  
cO(lO):-cl(IO). 
.@ member(A,l),append(I,Y,l). 
so lu t ion  = cT(&, Z, I ,  Y) 
?8(12, I2, IO, Yl, Y3):-append(IO, YI, Y3). 
c8(I2, Y3, IO, Y1, Z4):-c7(I2, Z4, XO, YI). 
cT(AO, Xl, D, II):-member(AO, I1). 
cT(Ao, \[A%lz4\], \[A%lx2\], Y3):-cB(AO, A1, I2, Y3, Z4). 
The first four lines are definitions of member and append. The lines that begin with "(~" are user's input atomic formulas 
(constraints). The system returns the constraint (cO(X)) that is equivalent to the input constraint, and its definitions. 
Figure 1: Demonstration of the constraint transformation routine 
Figure 2 shows a simple demonstration of our 
JPSG parser, and Figure 3 shows an example of 
treating ambiguity as constraint. The current parser 
treats a few feature and has little lexicon. However, 
the expansion is easy. It parses about ten to twenty 
words sentences within a second on VAX8600. Since 
JPSG is a declarative grammar formalism and cu- 
Prolog describes JPSG also declaratively, the parser 
needs parsing algorithms independently. In the cur- 
rent implementation, we adopt he left corner parsing 
algorithm \[1\]. Furthermore, we would even be able 
to abandon parsing algorithm altogether \[10\]. 
5 Final  Remarks  
ular. So the most difficult problem one must tackle 
concerns itself with heuristics about how to control 
computation.

The further study of cu-Prolog has many prospects. \[2\] 
For example, to expand descriptive ability of con- 
straints, the negative operator or the universal quan- 
tifier can be added. The constraint-based, alias par- 
tial, aspects of Situation Semantics\[3\] are naturally \[3\] 
implemented in terms of an extended version of cu- 
Prolog \[9\]. For practical applications in Artificial In- \[4\] 
telligence in general and natural language process- 
ing in particular, one needs a mechanism for carrying 
out computation partially, instead of totally as de- 
scribed above, where constraint transformation halts 
only when the constraint in question is entirely mod-
