Pronolninalization has been related to tile idea 
of a local focus - a set of discourse entities in 
the speaker's centre of attention, for exmnple ill 
Gundel et al (1993)'s givenness hierarchy or 
in centering theory. Both accounts ay that the 
determination of tile tbcus depends on syntac- 
tic as well as pragmatic factors, but have not 
been able to pin those factors down. In this 
paper, we uncover the major factors which de- 
termine the focus set in descriptive texts. This 
new tbcus definition has been ew, luated with re- 
spect to two corporm museum exhibit labels, 
mid newspaper mtieles. It provides an opera- 
tionalizable basis for pronoun production, and 
has been implemented as the reusable module 
gnome-np. The algorithm l)ehind gnome-np is 
conlpared with the most recent pronoun gener- 
ation algorithm of McCoy and Strube (1999). 
1 In t roduct ion  
Besides the well established problem of ln'onoun 
resolution, pronoun generation is now attract- 
ing renewed attention. In the past, generation 
systelns generated pronouns without attaching 
much importance to the problem, one notable 
exception being the classical algorithm of Dale 
(1990), loosely based on centering theory. With 
the emergence of corpus based studies in comtm- 
rational linguistics, the question arises whether 
it is possible to refine known standard algo- 
rithms, or whether an improvement is only to 
be achieved with the hell) of world knowledge 
reasoning - a matter too complex to be dealt 
with reliably at this time. Tile Ibrlner direction 
is represented by tile pioneering work of McCoy 
and Strube (1999). They propose a refined algo- 
rithm for tile choice between definite description 
on the one hand and pronoun on the other for

animate referents I , which is based on distancG 
time structure mid ambiguity constraints. 
Here we introduce a more general algoritlnn 
for the pronominalization decision that is valid 
not only for animate but for inanimate referents 
as well. In conformity with McCoy and Strube, 
we group noun phrases with definite determiner 
and proper nalnes together under tile term "det'- 
inite description". The algorithm proposes a 
new pronominalization strategy, which beyond 
McCoy and Strube (1999)'s criteria makes use 
of the discom'se status of the antecedent and 
parallelism effects. 
The algorithm has been implemented as the 
reusable module gnome-np. It has been re-used 
in tile web hypertext generation system ILEX 
(see Oberlander el; al. (1998)). It shows ml 
accuracy over 87% with respect o two corpora 
(each 5000 words) of difl'erent genres. 
2 Accounts  of  p ronomina l i za t ion  
In previous ace(rants pronominalization has 
been related to the idea of a local focus of ~d;- 
tention: a set of discourse referents who/wlfich 
is in the center of attention of the speaker (e.g. 
Sidner (1979), givenness hierarchy (Gun(lel et 
al., 1993), centering theory (Grosz et al, 1995), 
RAFT/RAPId. (Suri, 1993)). Whereas (Gundel 
el; al., 1993) do not atteml)t to make their fo- 
cus notion operationalizable, this has been at- 
tempted by fllrther develolmlents of centering. 
However these have mostly been applied to the 
pronoun resolution problem. In the following 
we discuss three versions of centering and show 
that their application to the pronoun generation 
problem is nevertheless linfited. 
Center ing .  Centering was developed to ex- 
plain local discourse coherence; the extent to 
which it benefits pronoun generation is how- 
ever not immediately clear, hi centering,

would have been realized by 1)ronouns using 
known algorithms, are in fact not, realized as 
pronomls in real text. They suggest that such 
NPs serve to mark ~time changes' in the dis- 
course. Their algorithm aecordingly makes use 
of distance, context ambiguity mid telnl)ora\] 
discourse structure to decide about 1)ronolni- 
nalization. In our work, we have considered a

that significantly simplifies the problem of pro- 
noun choice. It is based on a new definition of 
the local focus, which views the discourse status 
of the antecedent as the major motivation be- 
hind focusing. The algorithm performs equally 
well when applied to McCoy and Strube's cor- 
pus of newspaper articles. 
3 Corpus  ana lys is  
The algorithm we will present below has been 
developed in close relation to the MUSE corpus -
a corpus of museum exhibit labels a. The corpus 
is a collection of web pages of the Paul Getty 
Museum, pages from an exhibition catalogue, 
and pages froln a jewellery book. Typical char- 
acteristics are tile central role of inanimate ref- 
erents in these texts, and the lack of temporal 
change thus providing an interesting counter- 
t)art to the newst)aper genre investigated by Mc- 
Coy and Strube. 
With an overall set of around 5000 words, tile 
cortms contains 1450 NPs. Each NP has been 
annotated with respect o, among others, gram- 
matical function, discourse status, gender, num- 
ber, countability, and antecedent relationships. 
23% of the NPs form reference chains (i.e. at 
least two mentions of one and the same referent 
in one text), the other 77% are only mentioned 
once. We have 101 different reference chains; 
the chain-fbrming NPs fall into 10\] discourse- 
new and 213 anaphoric NPs. In the following, 
we will only discuss the anaphoric NPs. 50% of 
the anaphoric NPs are realized as definite de- 
scriptions, 50% as pronouns. We distinguish be- 
tween locally bound pronouns, which are deter- 
mined syntactically (Binding Theory, (Chore- 
sky, 1981)), and which we expect the tacti- 
cal generator to handle correctly, and pronouns 
which are not locally bound so-called dis- 
course pronouns. We investigated possible co l  
relations between the discourse 1)ronouns and 
semantic/pragmatic features of their context. 
The basic notions that we found were dis- 
tance, discourse status of the antecedent, and 
grammatical function of the antecedent. All 
three notions need a precise definition. 
D is tance .  ~lb be able to determine the dis- 
tance between a discourse entity and its an- 
tecedent, a precise determination f what counts 
3UI{L: h t tp  ://www. hcrc.  ed. ac. uk/ 'gnome/corpora 
as utterance unit is necessary. Following 
Kameyama (1998), we take as u t te rance  unit 
the finite clause, l{elative clauses and con> 
plenmnt clauses are not counted as utterances 
on their own. This means that we count 
clauses containing complement clauses or rel- 
ative clauses as single utterances. 4,a The pre- 
v ious u t te rance  is the preceding utterance at 
the same level of embedding. 
Note that we allow the treatment of clauses 
with VP coordination (subject ellipsis) as com- 
plex coordinated clauses as done in Kameyalna 
(1998), thus handling subject ellipsis as a dis- 
course pronoun; our algorithm does not; insist 
on this view however. 
The following correlation between pronoun 
use and distance was tbund in our corpus: 97% 
of the pronouns have an antecedent in the same 
or the previous utterance. 
D iscourse s tatus .  The information status of 
a discourse ntity in an utterance is either given 
or new. We use these terms with an identi- 
cal Lneaning as g~vn'nd and focus in Vallduvi 
(1993). Discourse status, as introduced by 
Prince (1992), is a similar but different notion: 
A discourse ntity is d iscourse-o ld,  if it has 
been mentioned before in the same discourse; 
it is d i scourse -new otherwise. All cases of 
givenness by indirect means like part-whole, 
set-member relationships, other bridging rela- 
tions, inferences (Prince's inferrables, anchored 
and situationally evoked entities) are judged as 
discourse-new, thus taking into account only 
tile identity antecedent relationship. We share 
Prince's opinion that pronominalization has to 
do with discourse status, whereas definiteness 
has to do with information status. 
66% of all short-distance discourse pronouns 
in the MUSE corpus refer to an antecedent which 
is in itself discourse-old. 
Sub jec thood .  The third strong correlation is
the relation between pronoun use and the grmn- 
matical function of the antecedent. 63% of dis- 
course pronouns have a subject as antecedent. 
The following table shows the overall distribu- 
tion of antecedent properties for short-distance

\] ~ased on these corpus  s{,ndy resnl|;s, we {lefhle a 
new notion of the local focus -- the set of refer- 
ents which arc awfilal)le for prononfilmlization. 
The local focus is ut}dated at each utterance 
boundary, and is defined as the set of referents 
of the 1)revious utterance which are: 
(a) d iscourse-o ld ,  or 
(b) rea l ized as sub jec t .

discourse structure signalling. 
Ambigu i ty .  Along with McCoy and Strube 
we argue that ambiguity with respect to gen- 
der/number influences the pronominalization 
decision: members of the local fbcus which have 
a competing referent (refbrent with similar gen- 
der/number) in some span to the left of the ref- 
erent to be generated should not be realized as 
t)ronouns o as to minimize the inference load 
for the reader. However, not to allow pronom- 
inalization in all ambiguous context situations 
does not ~I)t)ear to be consistent with real texts 
(McCoy and Strube, 1999). In the MUSE cortms 
one third of all focal NPs occur in ambiguous 
contexts, one half of them is pronominalized, 
the other half is not. Two questions require a 
precise answer to use the ambiguity constraint 
in a generation algorithm: 
? Which set of 1)reviously mentioned refer- 
ents or text st)an is taken into account br 
referents to be in competition? 
? Which referents are pronominalizcd despite 
an alnbiguous context? 
The answer is surprisingly simple: I/.eferents 
of the previous utterance which are not in the lo- 
cal fbcus do not disturb pronominalization, even 
if they have the stone gender/nmnber. Only if 
the actual referent has a competitor in the local 
fbcus, is pronominalization blocked. This is il- 
lustrated in Figure 1 with exmnples (3) and (4), 
respectively. In (3) the microscope is discourse- 
old and the only member in the local focus for 
(u2); the competing referents ocular micrvmc- 
tcr" mid technology are new and hence not local 
fbr utterance (u2). In (4), the local focus for 
(u2) is {the  at, th,  tl, e l,.o'asc} 
A slight improvement of the performance of 
the algorithm can be achieved by regarding 
the role of "heavy" nonrestrictive modification. 
hm\]uding the referents of discom'se-new NPs 
which are amplified by appositions or nonre- 
strictive relative clauses into the set; of' possible 
competitors improves accuracy slightly. 
D iscourse  s t ructure  signall ing. It is now 
known that detinite descriptions (or more gen- 
eral overspecified NPs) signal the start of a new 
discourse segment (Passommau, 1996; Vonk et 
al., 1992). For most generation systems gener- 
ate from an I/ST-like text; plan, discourse seg- 
ments are naturally given. The only question 
fl'om the generation perspective is the degree of 
detail provided by the segmentation. 
Our algorithm gnome-up assumes that the 
discourse segmentation has already been speci- 
fied. At each segment boundary, the local focus 
is set to n i l ,  thereby disallowing pronominal- 
ization for all discourse ntities of the first ut- 
terance in the segment onset. 
It is also well known that plmmed discourse 
with repeated phrases at the begimfing of a 
clause are seen as 'bad style'. Identical repeated 
pronouns at the clause onset are rarely found 
in expository and descriptive texts (2.6% of all 
discourse pronouns in our corpus). Hmnan writ- 
ers usually avoid possibly dull lack of variation 
by employing various aggregation techniques.

repetit ion blocking rule could still improve the 
result fllrther.

This  paper  has presented a new a lgor i thm tbr 
the pronomina l izat ion of third person discourse 
entit ies. The  Mgorithm, first, is imp lemented  
as a reusable module tbr generat ion systenls 
and, second, provides a theoret ical  account of 
pronomina l i zat ion  i general. 
The  proposed a lgor i thm provides a solution 
for quest ion \ [~  above by widening the defini- 
t ion of local Ibcus to be a set with possibly more 
than  one referent. The Mgor i thm also oilers a 
new solution fbr prob lem \ [ ~  above, aml)igu- 
ous pronoun generat ion.  Discom'se s t ructur ing 
(~\ ] )  is assumed as given. A sufficiently fine- 
grained discourse structur ing has been explored, 
for example,  by McCoy and Strube fbr their  do- 
n lmn of newspaper  articles, but  remMns an issue 
fbr future research fbr other domains.  We have 
shown that  next to 1)roxilnity, the discourse sta- 
tus of the mltecedcnt is a main cr iter ion for trig- 
gering pronomilml izat ion.  
The  suggested a lgor i thm general izes known 
fbcusing accounts. Gundel  et al (1993)'s cog- 
nit ive slat, us of being "in fbcus" is now approxi-  
mated  by the set of all discourse-old entit ies and 
the subject  of the previous utterance.  The  new 
focus determinat ion  is also a general izat ion of 
center ing's  Cb. The  focus so defined serves two 
funct ions s imultaneously:  to tr igger 1)ronomi- 
nMization, and to provide the set; of compet i tors  
for pronoun generat ion in ambiguous  contexts.  
A l though our t ra in ing corpus is too small  to jus- 
t i fy general  clMms, the ewduat ion with respect 
to tile newspaper  genre provides evidence that  
this f inding is valid for p lanned discourse ill gen- 
erM, independent  of the concrete genre.
