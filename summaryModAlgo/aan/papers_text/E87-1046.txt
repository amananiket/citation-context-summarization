FINITE STATE PROCESSING OF TONE SYSTEMS 
Dafydd Gibbon 
(U Bielefeld) 
ABSTRACT 
It is suggested in this paper that two- leve l  
morphology theory (Kay, Koskenniemi) can be ex- 
tended to include morphological tone. This exten- 
sion treats phonological features as I/O tapes for 
Finite State Transducers in a parallel sequential 
incrementation (PSI) architecture; phonological 
processes (e.g. assimilation) are seen as variants of 
an elementary unification operation over feature 
tapes (linear unification phonology, LUP). The 
phenomena analysed are tone terracing with 
tone-spreading (horizontal assimilation), down- 
step, upstep, downdrift, upsweep in two West Afri- 
can languages, Tem (Togo) and Baule (C6te 
d'Ivoire). It is shown that an FST acccount leads 
to more insightful definitions of the basic pheno- 
mena than other approaches (e.g. phonological 
rules or metrical systems). 
1. Descriptive context 
The topic of this paper is tone sandhi in two 
West African tone languages and suitable formal 
models for it. The languages investigated are Tern 
(Gur/Voltaic family, Togo) and Baule (Akan fami- 
ly, C6te d'Ivoire). Tone languages of other types, 
in particular the Sino-Tibetan languages, will not 
be discussed. 
The specific concern of this paper is with the 
way in which certain quite wel l -known morpho- 
phonological (lexical) tone patterns are realized in 
sequence in terms of phonetic pitch patterns. There 
are three interacting factors involved: i. tone- text  
association rules; ii. tone-sandhi  rules; iii. phone- 
tic interpretation rules. 
Tone- text  association rules are concerned with 
the association of tones with syllables (primary 
associations and a form of tone spreading) as well 
as floating tones and compound tones. Floating 
tones are not associated with syllables, but are po- 
stulated to explain appparent irregularities in pho- 
netic patterning in terms of regular tone sandhi 
properties. 
The tone sandhi rules define how tones affect 
their neighbours. The example to be treated here is 
a kind of tonal assimilation known as tonal sprea- 
ding in which low tones are phonetically raised 
following a high tone or, more frequently, high 
tones are lowered after a low tone, either to the 
level of the low tone (total downstep) or to a mid 
level (partial downstep). The newly defined tone is 
then the reference point for following tones. 
The latter kind of assimilation produces a cha- 
racteristic perceptual, and experimentally measu- 
rable, effect known as tone terracing. Tone se- 
quences are realized at a fairly high level at the 
beginning of a sequence, and at certain we l l -  
defined points the whole pitch register appears "to 
be downstepped to a new level. The process may 
be iterated several times. It is often represented in 
the literature in the following way (partial down- 
step); it can be seen that a later high tone may be 
as high as or lower than an earlier low tone: 
hhh l lhh l lhh  
In particular, it will be seen that the two ter- 
raced tone languages, Tem and Baule, involve si- 
milar processes in detail and have similar basic 
FST architectures, but differ systematically at cer- 
tain wel l -def ined points involving sandhi generali- 
ty, and scope of sandhi context.

Detailed phonetic interpretation i volves pitch 
patterns between neighbouring tones of the same 
type within terraces. These are processses of 
downdrift (neighbouring tones fall) or upsweep 
(neighbouring tones, usually high tones, rise). 
They will not be dealt with here. 
2. Theoretical context 
The view is developing, based on work by Kay 
and Kaplan, Koskenniemi, Church, and others, 
that in phonology it is sufficient o use finite state 
transducers which are not allowed to apply to their 
own output. Kay and Kaplan have shown that it is 
possible to reduce conventional, so-cal led 
"context-sensitive" phonological rules to finite- 
state relations, and to apply the FSTs thus pro- 
duced in sequential order (Kay 1986). 
Koskenniemi developed a somewhat different 
concept for Finnish morphology, in which the 
FSTs operate as parallel filters over the input: they 
must all agree in their output. A careful analysis 
also shows that Church's allophonic parser, in his 
actual implementation using matrix operations to 
simulate bottom up chart parsing, can also be seen 
as a system of parallel finite state filters. The PSI 
(Parallel Sequential Incrementation) system of pro- 
sodic analysis being developed by myself in the 
DFG Forschergruppe "Koh~renz" in Bielefeid in- 
corporates a similar concept of FSTs used as a pa- 
rallel filter bank (Gibbon & al. 1986). 
The context within descriptive phonology is 
that of theories which postulate interreelated but 
structurally autonomous parallel levels of organi- 
zation in phonology. The four major classical di- 
rections in this area are traditional intonation ana- 
lysis (surveyed and developed in Gibbon 1976), 
Firthian "prosodic phonology", Pike's simul- 
taneous hierarchies, and the non-linear (autoseg- 
mental and metrical) phonologies of the last thir- 
teen years. 
Parallel FST systems are used in order to ex- 
plicate both traditional phonological rules, so long 
as they do not apply to their own output, and also, 
with appropriate synchronization measures, the 
parallel tiers which figure in autosegmental phono- 
logy, the mappings between these tiers, and the 
mappings between abstract and concrete phonolo- 
gical and phonetic levels of representation. FST 
systems are conceptually bidirectional; they may 
easily be processed in either direction with the 
same finite state mechanism; the problem of the 
recoverability of underlying structure (short of am- 
biguity through genuine neutralization) loses its 
importance. 
The idea of formulating prosodic patterns in 
English intonation in FS terms was originated and 
developed by Pierrehumbert (1980), though FS 
intonation models had been developed much ear- 
lier by 't Hart and others for DutcL intonation. 
These existing FS intonation descriptions are 
straightforward finite state automata (FSAs; for 
Dutch, probabilistic FSAs). The problem of map- 
ping such patterns at one level on to patterns at 
another, the traditional problem in descriptive lin- 
guistics as well as in computational parsing and 
translation, has not been formulated in finite state 
terms for this domain. This mapping question is a 
different one from the question of recognition, and 
the finite state devices required for an answer to 
the question are different. Additionally, the tone 
language application constitutes a different domain. 
The input and output languages for FSTs are 
both regular sets (Type 3 languages). FSTs have 
various interesting properties which are in part 
similar to those of FSAs. The reversibility property 
shown in the simulations is one of the most inter- 
esting. Any FST which is deterministic n one di- 
rection is not necessarily deterministic n the other, 
as the neutralization facts in Tern and Baule show. 
Furthermore, it is not true for FSTs, as it is for 
FSAs, that for any non--deterministic FST there is 
a deterministic one which is weakly equivalent re- 
lative to the input language. This only holds if the 
paired input and output symbols are interpreted 
as compound (relational) input symbols, and the 
input and output apes are seen as a single tape of 
pairs. This is an abstraction which formally redu- 
ces FSTs to FSAs. Kay has suggested this perspec- 
tive on FSTs as an explication for relations be- 
tween linguistic levels, where FSTs define relations 
between linguistic levels of representation i an 
essentially declarative fashion, though with a pro- 
cedural interpretation. For a slightly different FST 
definition cf. Aho & Ullman (1972). In current 
computational theories of language (FUG, GPSG, 
292 
LFG), the standard treatment for concord restric- 
tion, to which phonological assimilation and neu- 
tralization may be compared, is in terms of a class 
of operations related to unification. The situation 
in autosegmental phonology is simpler than in syn- 
tax, in that each feature or tier can be modelled by 
a finite state device. The elementary unification 
operator equired is, correspondingly, restricted to 
non-recursive, adjacent feature specification on a 
given tier, as in the present analysis. In a 
non--parallel architecture, the operation would be 
embedded in a more complex, perhaps 
context-free-style,  context. 
3.The Tern and Baule data 
The essential tonal properties of Tern are: 
downstep, downdrift, phonetically constant 
(non-terraced) low tone, high tone spreading over 
a following low; only terracing and sandhi are 
dealt with here. The Tern data and the inter-level 
relations are taken from Tchagbale (1984). The 
following shows a simulation using a bidirectional 
FST interpreter, with runs in each direction.

The essential tonal properties of Baule are: 
partial or total downstep (style-determined), up- 
step, upsweep, downdrift, tone spreading of both 
low and high over the first tone of an appositely 
specified sequence, compound tone. Again, only 
terracing and sanditi are dealt with. The Baule 
sandhi data are from Ahoua (1987a), simulated by 
the same interpreter, with an FST designed for 
Baule.

The underlying morphophonological tones are 
annotated as follows: 
L = low 
H = high 
*L = low with an additional morphological 
feature (Tem only). 
294 
The surface phonetic tones are: 
LC = low constant (in Baule, only initial) 
HC = high constant (only initial) 
H = high relative to currently defined level 
L = low relative to currently defined level 
(Bade) 
!H = mid (=downstepped high) tone. 
The simulations how the properties of the tone 
sandhi systems of Tern and Bade very clearly, in 
particular the contextual dependencies (sandhi). 
The reverse (recognition) simulations how the ef- 
fects of tone neutralization: in the reverse direc- 
tion, non-deterministic analyses are required, 
which means in the present context hat more than 
one underlying form may be found. 
The tone systems of Tern and Baule can be 
seen to differ in several important respects, which 
are summarized in the transition network represen- 
tations given in Figures 1 and 2, respectively.

Another interesting point pertains to local 
vs. global pitch relations. The relations described 
here are clearly local, if they are formalizable in 
finite state terms. But this is not to say that there 
is not a global factor involved in addition to these 
local factors. On the contrary, Ahoua(1987b) has 
demonstrated the presence of global intonational 
factors in Baule which are superimposed on the 
local tonal relations and partly suppress them in 
fast speech styles. 
4.Conclusion 
It is immediately obvious that the transition 
diagramme representations show similar iterative 
cyclical processes for Tem and for Bade; the Bau- 
le system has an "inner" and an "outer" cycle, 
which may be accessed and left at well-defined 
points. At corresponding points in the diagrammes, 
295 
both systems show "epicycles", i.e. transitions 
which start and end at the same node, and the tone 
assimilation transitions also occur at similar points 
in the systems relative to the epicycles. 
The suggested interpretation for these interre- 
lated iterative process types, three in Tem and five 
in Baule, is that they are immediately plausible 
explications for the concept of linguistic rhythm 
and interlocking rhythmic patternings. This is the 
same explicandum, fundamentally, as in metrical 
phonology, but it is associated here with the claim 
that an explicit concept of iteration is a more ade- 
quate expl:.~'ation for rhythm than a tree-based, 
implicitly context-free notation, which is not only 
over-powerful but also i l l-suited to the problem, 
or traditional phonological rules, whose formal 
properties are unclear. 
The formal properties of Tem and Baule as ter- 
raced tone languages can be defined in terms of 
the topology of the FST transition diagrammes: 
i. The fundamental notion of "terrace" or 
"tonal unit" is defined as one 
cycle (iteration, oscillation) between ma- 
jor nodes of the system. 
ii. A major node is a node which has unlike 
input symbols on non-epicyclic input and 
output transitions and can also be a final 
node. 
iii. Terrace-internal monotone sequences are 
defined as epicycles; in Baule, epicyclic 
sequences tart not on the second but on 
the third item of the sequence, and a 
non-epicyclic sub-system is required. 
iv. Stepping and spreading occurs on any 
non-epicyclic transition leaving a ma- 
jor node; in languages with downstep only 
(Tem), this only applies to high tones, in 
those with downstep and upstep, upstep 
occurs with low tones in these positions. 
These definitions how that the FST formalism 
is not just another "notational variant", but pre- 
cise, highly suggestive, and useful in that it is a 
formally clear and simple system with wel l -un- 
derstood computational properties which make it 
easy to implement tools for testing the consistency 
and completeness of a given description. 
In current non-l inear approaches in descrip- 
tive phonology it is not clear that the basic 
explicanda-types of iteration or rhythm, the cha- 
racter of terracing as a particular kind of iteration 
or oscillation, and the relative complexity of dif- 
ferent tone systems - are captured by the nota- 
tion, in contrast o the clarity and immediate inter- 
pretability of the FST model. In one current model 
(Clements, communicated by Ahoua), complex 
constructive definitions are given; they may be 
characterized in terms of conventional parsing 
techniques as follows: 
i. analyze the input suing into "islands" 
which define the borders between tone ter- 
races; 
ii. proceed "bottom up" to make constituents 
(feet, in general to the left) of these is- 
lands; 
iii. proceed either bottom up or top down to 
create a right-branching tree over these 
constituents. 
iv. (implicit) perform tonal assimilation on the 
left--most one on each left branch. 
This is an unnecessarily complex system, whose 
formal properties (context-free? bottom up? 
right-left'?) are not clear. 
A complete evaluation of different approaches 
will clearly require prior elaboration of the 
tone-text association rules and the phonetic inter- 
pretation rules. The former will follow the prin- 
ciples laid down in Goldsmith's well -- formedness 
condition on tone alignment, which also point to 
the applicability of FST systems. 
In summary, the prospects for a comprehensive 
FST based account of morphophonological tone 
phenomena ppear to be good. The prospects are 
all the more interesting in view of the develop- 
ments in FS morphology and phonology over the 
past four years, suggesting that an overall model 
for all aspects of sublexical processing may be fea- 
sible using an overall parallel sequential incremen- 
tation (PSI) architecture with FST components for 
inter-level mapping. It may be predicted with 
some hope of success that components which are 
296 
more powerful than Finite State will turn out to be 
unnecessary, at least for the sublexical domain, 
even outside the conventional area of Western 
European languages.
