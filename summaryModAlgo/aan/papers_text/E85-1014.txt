We single out a class of prototypes i.e., 
a class of constructions forcing the obligatory 
coreference or obligatory noncoreference.  An  
essential feature of prototypes is their 
undistinctiveness. In this sense  they are the 
most natural and  efficient mearis of 
communicat ion  in discourse. 
The  non-application of prototype should be 
well motivated. This  leads to the rule of 
res t r i c ted  cho ice  s ta t ing  that  whenever  it is  
poss ib le  the  app l i ca t ion  of a p ro to type  shou ld  
be  pre fer red .  
The  ru le  of the  res t r i c ted  cho ice  suggests  
the  genera l  out l ine  of in terpret ing  ambiguous  
sentences ,  s t r i c t ly  speak ing ,  the  method  of  
o rder ing  admiss ib le  in terpreta t ions :  those  wh ich  
can  be  equ iva lent ly  expressed  by  means  of  
a p ro to type  are  less  probab le .  In o ther  words ,  
the  ru le  of  the  res t r i c ted  cho ice  can  be  
regarded  as  some k ind  of  mechan ism order ing

INTRODUCTION 
The  crucial prob lem in d iscourse analysis 
is the appropriate transposition of all 
express ions  occurr ing in it, into reality (see, 
for instance, the f ramework  provided by Kemp 
in (Kamp,  1981)).  Even  pre l iminary  analysis 
shows  that one  real object can  be identified 
by var ious surface constructions. Th is  forces 
the necessity of dividing surface express ions  
into c lasses denoting ident ical  individuals. 
The  above  prob lem can  formally be stated 
as follows. To  each  d iscourse D we assign 
some reality wh ich  can  be understood as 
a set ID of individuals (semantic d iscourse 
domain) together with a set of relat ions 
defined on ID. The semantic d iscourse domain 
can be interpreted twofold: 
1.o as a set of real  objects i.e., objects 
exist ing in actual wor ld;  
2 ? as a set of mental objects i.e., objects 
existing in language user ' s  mind. 
Al though the  f i r s t  in terpreta t ion  is  more  
natura l ,  it l eads  to some onto log ica l  p rob lems,  
concern ing  the  d i s t inc t ion  of f i c t i t ious  and  
non- f i c t i t ious  ent i t ies .  S ince  there  is  no  such  
d i s t inc t ion  f rom l ingu is t i c  perspect ive  the  
second in terpreta t ion  seems bet ter  mot ivated .  
" /he  next  s tep  is  to de f ine  syntact i c  
d i scourse  domain ,  denoted  by  S_ ,  i .e. ,  a se t  
L) of d i scourse  express ions  re fer r ing  to 
ind iv idua ls  ( se t  of ind iv idua ls ) .  The  mapp ing  
ass ign ing  ind iv idua ls  to syntact i c  express ions  
w i l l  be  ca / led  the  re ference  funct ion  and  
denoted  by  R. F 'o rma/ ly ,  R : S D 2 ID. 
Example  
(D I )  John and  Peter admire winter. They  
are  o f ten  sk i ing  together .  
SDI" - {"John", "Peter", "winter", "they ''~ 
ID 1 - ~John, Peter, winter~ 
( " John" )  - {John} 
R ("Peter") - {Peterl 
R ( " they" )  ,, {John, Peter\]"  
R ( "w inter" )  - {winter}  
We say  that d iscourse  express ions  x and  
y a.re coreferencial, what  we  denote by  xCy,  
if and  only if they refer to the same set of 
individuals. 
Formally, 
for each  x,y ~ S u xCy  iff R(x)= R(y)  
It is readily verified that C is an 
equivalence relation. Obv ious ly  each  
equivalence class of C contains coreferentia/ 
expressions.  The  set of equivalence c lasses  
of C will be  ca/led the reference sta~te of 
d iscourse and  denoted by  RSD.  
Example  
(D2)  John took a knife. 
( RSD 2 ) " "~ knife '~-. John 5~ ~"a 
(D3)  John took a knife. He  hurt himself. 
(RSD3)  ~"JOhn:', "he",  "himself'.~ 
knife"}. 
We can  observe  here that adding new 
utterance to the discour.~;e changes  its 
93 
reference state. In this sense  RSD is a 
dynamic  notion Let us note also that the 
prob lem of anaphora  solution can  be regarded  
as defining the relation C for  the who le  
discourse. 
Both the speaker,  while constructin~ 
a discourse, and the hearer, while eunalysing 
it, try to achieve the identity of RSD at  each 
step of the discourse. We argue in this 
paper that to accomplish this effect, the 
speaker has at his disposal (at each moment) 
a more restricted set of l inguistic 
constructions than it seems intuitively. Let 
us notice that express ions  belonging to one  
equivalence class have  var ious syntactic 
shapes  at different steps of discourse. It ca/'* 
be shown that the syntactic form of 
express ions  at particular moments  is not 
accidential, i.e., e lements of indicated 
equivalence class are not interchangeable. 
P R O'I'O'I'YP E S 
Recent  d iscourse  theories provide several  
levels of larlguage analysis: morphological, 
syntactic, semantic and  somet imes  pragmatic. 
Each  of these levels determines a 
characteristic set of notions and  mechan isms.  
It is assumed here that the analysis of 82", 
utterance on each  levels of language should 
yield complete information obtainable by  tools 
available on this level 
Classical anaphor  resolvers act on 
semantic level on d iscourse  analysis. ~Are take 
the position that for inflexion al l anguages  the 
coreference relation can  be partially descr ibed 
on the syntactic level An  essential feature of 
this par t ia l  characteristic is defining the 
coreference relation quite apart from Peal 
individuals, i.e. without specyfing the reference 
funct ion .  
"Po fix some ideas let us cons ider  an 
utterance containing the noun phrases  NP l ,  
..., NP . If there  i s  no  in fo rmat ion  regard ing  n core ference ,  a l l  we  can  do  i s  to  asser t  that  
the  core ference  re la t ion  i s  inc luded between 
the  "min imal "  re la t ion ,  i .e . ,  re la t ion  ident i f ied  
by  the  un i t  equ iva lence  c lasses  NP~ , ..., 
NP and the mcLximal one, i.e. adm,Ring in 
one nclass all number -gender  agreeable  
phrases.  
We very  se ldom deal with such  a situation 
in practice. A lmost  a /ways  we can  ass ign to 
an utterance a syntactic level information 
stating obligatory- coreference or obliqatory 
noncore ference  of some expressions. 
The  surface constructions carrying this 
kind of information with respect to p ronouns  
and  zero pronouns  (in the case  of elided 
subject) will be called prototypes. Ln other 
words  proto types  can  be regarded  as  
syntactic means  forcing obligatory coreference 
or obligatory noncore ference  between pronouns  
or zero pronouns  and  other surface 
expressions. 
Let us cons ider  few instances of 
prototypes. Because  the ideas presented here 
are implemented for the Pol ish language, the 
not ion  o f  p ro to type  w i l l  be  i l l us t ra ted  w i th  
a number  of Polish sentences.  An  elided 
subject specific for inflexional languages  can  
be observed  here. It is clenoted by  (~ 
Because  elided subject expresses  some 
aspects  of thematic continuity, its 
i n te rpretat ion  seems to  be  an  impor tant  s tep  
dur ing  d i scourse  ana lys i s .  Eng l i sh  
t rans la t ions  o f  p resented  examples  preserve  
the i r  syntact i c  shape .  Unfor tunate ly  they  are  
somet imes  incorrect as  Engl ish sentences.  
(1.) Piotr obudzit si~1 ~)3.. podszec?~ do okna, 
~2 ot~vorzy~ je  i ~)3 wyskoczy{ .  
Peter woke  up, ~I  came to the w indow,  
2 opened it and  ~)3 jumped out. 
Express ions :  
Peter, #I, ~2, ~)3 are coreferentiaL Another  
interpretation is unadm,ssible, in (I) we  deal 
with obligatory coreference of express ions  
(denoted by a - -- b).  
(2) ~ I ~ 2  podszeci% do okna, 
4 ~ 4  ~skoczy~ 
~)1. Woke up, q)2 came to the  w indow,  
q)3 opened i t  and  #4 jumped out .  
in (2), similarly as in (a) (co-ordinate 
c lauses)  and  in (3), (4) (subordinate 
c lauses)  the only acceptable interpretation 
is explicitely showed.  
(3) Z~im Ca ,~s~ea~2 zgasi~ ~wiat~o. 
Before  911 left, 912 turned  the  l ight  off. 
(4 )  ~\].~_Z_gasi~ wiat~o, zanim....w~2 wyszedL  
911 Turned  the L~ght off, before ~2 left. 
The  next examples  concern  the obligatory 
noncore ference  of express ions  (denoted by  a+-b) 
(5) Ona  lubi ja~ 
She  likes her. 
(6 )  (~ zapyta~ P io t ra , '~czy  Jan  p6 jdz ie

? Asked  Peter, whether  John wou ld  
go to the theatre. 
94 
(7) ? Usiad~ do stc~u, a .Tan naleuI: mu wina. 
Sat  at the tab le ,  und John poured  
him out  some wine .  
The  above  examples  pose  the quest ion  of 
how the c lass  of p ro to types  shou ld  be s ing led  
out. Th is  p rob lem can  be  so lved  by  
spec i fy ing  a co l lec t ion  of ru les  concern ing  
the ob l igatory  core ference  and  ob l igatory  
noncore ference .  The  exact  format  of these  
ru les  is  beyond the scope  of th is  paper .  
For  in f lex iona l  languages  they  depend on the 
type  of cons idered  sentence ,  the sentence-  
- leve l  funct ions  of cons idered  phrases  
and  the i r  syntact i c  shape .  As  a s imple  
example  of such  a ru le  let us  cons ider  the 
bas ic  c r i te r ion  of exc lud ing  core ference :  
If the ob jec t  is  expressed  by  means  of 
a re f lex ive  pronoum,  then it is  core ferent ia l  
w i th  the sub jec t ;  in o ther  cases  the 
re fe rent ia l  ident i l y  of the sub jec t  and  ob jec t  
is excluded. 
Th is  criterion can  be  applied both for 
deterrninig coreferents of objects - blocking 
the subject, and  in tesf/n~ the possible 
antecedents  of the subject - blocking the 
objects. Th is  is exactly the case  we have  in 
(5 ) .  
THE RULE OF' RESTRICTED CHOICE  
A conclus ive criterion of being a prototype 
results from analysing a given sentence  it% 
isolation. If it is possible to assert or to 
exc lude the referential identity of some 
express ions  of the sentence, indepedent ly of 
its context then  the sentence  can  be  regarded  
as  an instance of prototype. An  essential 
feature  of p ro to types  is that they  are  
complete ly  ind is t inc t ive  and  in th is  sense  they  
are  the most p roper  too l  fo r  express ing  
a cer ta in  re la t ionsh ip  in the u t te rance .  Th is  
s t rong  re la t ionsh ip  makes  it poss ib le  to 
e l iminate  some in terpreta t ions ,  wh ich  in o ther  
cases  shou ld  be regarded  as  probab le  too. 
If we agree  that ach iev ing  unambigu i ty  of 
d i scourse  is  the major  goa l  both  for  the 
speaker  and  the hearer ,  then  the non-  
-app l i ca t ion  of prototype, as  the most  natural 
and  efficient mea/qs of communicat ion  should 
be well motivated. When such  a special reason  
is lacking, the speaker  should  apply a 
a prototype. Under  this assumpt ion  the set of 
linguistic tools available to the speaker  is 
restricted. 
The  notion of prototype can  be  natural/y 
applied on the syntactic level of d iscourse  
anadysis to limit the number  of hypotheses  for 
further consideration. 13ut it can  also be useful 
on the hi~her levels to interpret ambiguous  
discourses. Strictly speak in~ the properties 
of prototype suggest  the genera l  outline of 
i n te rpret ing  ambiguous  sentences ,  more  
prec i se ly  a method of o rder in~ poss ib le  
in terpreta t ions  w i th  respect  to the i r  p laus ib i l i ty .  
F rom the set  of poss ib le  in terpreta t ions  of 
a sentence ,  those  that  can  be  equ iva lent ly  
expressed  by  means  of p ro to type ,  shou ld  be  
regarded  as  less plausible. The  justification 
of this cho ice  is clear: if the speaker  wanted  
to point out such  an  interpretation, he wou ld  
naturally ach ieve  it by  applying a prototype. 
In v iew of the obove  we can  formulate 
the rule of restricted choice. It states that 
whenever  it is possible the application of 
a proto type  shou ld  be pre fer red .  
It i s  i r rpor tant  to not i ce  that  the ru le  of 
res t r i c ted  cho ice  can  be v iewed from the 
perspect ive  both  of the speaker  cont ruct ing  
the d i scourse  and  the hearer  mode l l ing  it. 
The  speaker  should apply  prototypes 
whenever  it is possible. The  hearer  should  
take this fact into consideration. 
Let us try to interpret the concrete 
sentences with the help of the rule of 
restricted choice. 
(8) Zanim ~)I wyszed~, .Tan zgasi~ ~wiat{o. 
Before ~I  leftmasc, .Tohn tumedmasc 
the light off. 
There  are two interpretations here: 
(9) Zanim zgasi   wia o 
Before ~ I  left, J ohn  turned the light off. 
l 
(1.0) Zan im ~I  w3zszed2, Jan zgasi{ ~wiat~o. 
Before ~ll left, John turned the light off. 
(~ denotes  the reference to the context). 
But  the first interpretation can  be  expressed  
by  means  of prototypes. 
(P l )  Zan im ~I  ~Aryszed{, @2 zgasit ~wiat~o. 
Before ~1 left, ~2 turned the Light off. 
(P2)  Jan zan im wyszedt ,  ~1 zgasit gwiatto. 
John before left, ~1  turned the light off. 
Accord ing  to the rule of restricted choice 
the first interpretation should  be  regarded  as  
less probable  (note that it can  be  expressed  
by  prototype). Hence  the second interpretation 
should be  chosen.  
9S 
Another  example  i s  more  complicated. 
(11)  Zan im o__.nn wyszed~,  ~I  zapy~ak ~eo, 
czy  #2 p6jdzie do kina. 
Before he leftmasc , @I, had  asked  him, 
whether  ~2 wou ld  have  gone  to the 
cinema. 
In the embedded c lause 
03. zapy%a~ gO 
there acts the rule of obligatory noncore ference  
excluding the referentia/ identily of subject and  
ob ject  in this sentence: 
Zan im on wyszed~,  @~zapytak j~o,  
czy  ~2 p6jdzie do kina. 
Accord ing  to our  definition the above  sentence  
is an instance of a prototype. 
Exc luding the coreference of pointed 
express ions  decreases  the numer  of possible 
interpretations, but does  not clear up all 
referential relationships in this ambiguous  
sentence. A l though there are no further 
syntactic p remises  to resolve this ambiguity 
we  can  specify the less probable interpretation 
by appying the rule of restricted choice. If the 
speaker  wanted  to express  the fo l low ing  
sense: 
(12) Zan im X wyszeck%, X zapy%a.% go, 
czy  @1. p6jdzie do kineu . 
he should have  used  the following (structural) 
prototype: 
(13) Z~im ? ~ 1  ~apyt~ go, 
czy  ~2 p6 jdz ie  do  k ina .  
( In  such  a sequence  of c lauses  in the  
sentence the rule of ob l igatory  coreference 
demandes  that ? and  @1. shou/d be identified). 
It follows there fore  that the interpretation: 
(3.4) Zan im on wyszedku .~ l  zap vta~ go, 
czy  ~2 p6jdzie do kina. 
is the less probable and  should be computed  
as the last one. 
NONMONOTONIC ITY  OF  THE RULE 
05 '  lqESTRICTED CHOICE 
Cons ider  the following example:  
(15) I<iedy @I podszed~ do Piotra, 
by~ on zdenerwowany.  
When ? I  came near  Peter, 
he was  nervous.  
There  are two possible interpretations 
(3.6) K iedy  ? I  podszed{ do Piofra, by~ on 
zden  erwowany.  
( 1,7 ) K iedy  ~p.odszed~ do P io t ra ,  by~A, on 
zden  erwowany.  
2ecause  the second interpretation can  
unambiguous ly  be expressed  by  the prototypical 
c on struction: 
(3.8) K iedy  ~I podszed{ do Piotra, by~ ~)2 
zden  er%vowalny. 
When ~)I came near  Peter Q2 was  
nervous.  
accord ing to the rule of restricted cho ice the 
first interpretaf/on should be preferred. 
The  rule of resfx'icted cho ice is based  on 
the assumpt /on  that whenever  it is possible 
people  use  unambiguous  constructions. 
A l though usually va/id this assumpt ion  cannot  
be regarded  as  genera@ truth. Th is  meeuns that 
the rule of restricted cho ice enab les  one to 
jump to plausible but not ironclad conclusions. 
"l~pically, such  conc lus ions  can  be invalidated 
when new information i s  available. In our 
example  the preferred intezq0retation might he 
overturned when we extend our d iscourse  as  
follows: 
(1.9) I<iedy ~I  podszed~ do Piotra, 
by~ on zdener-vvowany. 
BM~ tc wyn ik  wcze~nie jsze j  k~6tni 
z Piotrem. 
?I  came near  Peter  he was  When 
nervous.  
That  was the result of an earlier 
quarrel with Peter. 
96 
The neoess i ty  of chang ing  the  pre fer red  
interpretation follcws from the fact that new 
information is available. The  property of 
drawing plausible but defeasible inferences 
characterizes non-monoton ic  reasoning. 
Various forms of this kind of reasoning are 
now being deve loped  (see (~AI -84) ) .  
It is now widely recogn ized  that d iscourse  
unders tand ing  regu l res  nonmonoton ic  
mechan isms in many aspects .  The  ru le  of 
res t r i c ted  cho ice  is  an  example  of such  
a nonmonoton ic  too l  
C ONCLUSIONS 
(1.) Wh i le  const ruct ing  d i scourse  the  
speaker  wants  the  hearer  to unders tand  him 
correctly. Even  if he  uses  ambiguous  
constructions he intends to cemrr, unicate the 
unique interpretations, and  not to create in 
heater 's  mind a set of a/l possible hypotheses.  
It follows that constructhag NLU systems, wh ich  
~enerate all admissible interpretations, 
contradicts common sense  reasonln~. So  the 
essential prob lem is to determine methods  o/ 
choos ing  the most  appropriate interpretation. 
If this plausible interpretation fails, i t  should 
be revised. 
(2) Employ ing  the rule of  restricted cho ice 
assumes  the existence of some mechan ism 
wh ich  determines whether  a given construction 
can  be regarded  as a prototype. 'l~bis can  be  
ach ieved  by  specifyins a set of rules quali~j'ing 
the obUgatory  coreference and  noncore ference  
of referrins expressions. A partied set of such  
rules for the l::ollsh language has been  
presented in (Dunin-K~plicz,  1983).
