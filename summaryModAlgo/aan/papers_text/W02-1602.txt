Abstract
Coedition of a natural language text and its representation in some interlingual form seems the best and simplest way to
share text revision across languages. For various reasons, UNL graphs are the best candidates in this context. We are
developing a prototype where, in the simplest sharing scenario, naive users interact directly with the text in their
language (L0), and indirectly with the associated graph. The modified graph is then sent to the UNL-L0 deconverter and
the result shown. If is is satisfactory, the errors were probably due to the graph, not to the deconverter, and the graph is
sent to deconverters in other languages. Versions in some other languages known by the user may be displayed, so that
improvement sharing is visible and encouraging. As new versions are added with appropriate tags and attributes in the
original multilingual document, nothing is ever lost, and cooperative working on a document is rendered feasible. On the
internal side, liaisons are established between elements of the text and the graph by using broadly available resources
such as a L0-English or better a L0-UNL dictionary, a morphosyntactic parser of L0, and a canonical graph2tree
transformation. Establishing a "best" correspondence between the "UNL-tree+L0" and the "MS-L0 structure", a lattice,
may be done using the dictionary and trying to align the tree and the selected trajectory with as few crossing liaisons as
possible. A central goal of this research is to merge approaches from pivot MT, interactive MT, and multilingual text
authoring.

La co?dition d'un texte en langue naturelle et de sa repr?sentation dans une forme interlingue semble le moyen le
meilleur et le plus simple de partager la r?vision du texte vers plusieurs langues. Pour diverses raisons, les graphes UNL
sont les meilleurs candidats dans ce contexte. Nous d?veloppons un prototype o?, dans le sc?nario avec partage le plus

graphe associ?. Le graphe modifi? est ensuite envoy? au d?convertisseur UNL-L0 et le r?sultat est affich?. S'il est
satisfaisant, les erreurs ?taient probablement dues au graphe et non au d?convertisseur, et le graphe est envoy? aux
d?convertisseurs vers d'autres langues. Les versions dans certaines autres langues connues de l'utilisateur peuvent ?tre

Introduction
Creating and maintaining aligned multilingual
documents is a growing necessity. In the current
practice, a multilingual document consists in many
parallel monolingual files, which may be technical
documentation as well as help files, message files,
or simply thematic information put on the web and
intended for a multilingual audience (medicine,
cooking, travel?). The task is difficult even for a
document managed in a centralized manner.
Ususally, it is first created in a unique source
language, and translated into several target
languages. There must be a way to keep trak of
modifications, possibly done at various places on
different linguistic versions. From time to time,
somebody has to decide which modifications to
integrate in the next release of the document. For
that, modifications done in target languages have to
be translated back into the source language. The
new and the old source versions are then compared
using (fuzzy) matching techniques, so that only
really new segments are sent for translation.
The problem arises even more if the documents are
not managed centrally, so that the monolingual files
are often in various formats (Word, EgWord,
Interleaf, FileMaker, DBMS formats, etc.).
A. Assimi [1, 2] has shown how to "realign"
parallel decentralized documents and apply the
methodology sketched above. However, in both
cases, human translators have to retranslate the
modified or new source segments, or to revise them
if they are retranslated by a quality MT system.
Contrary to what is often said, quality MT exists,
but for specific contexts only. (See [14]).
What we would like to do is to make it possible to
share the revision work across languages, whatever
the domain and the context. It is clearly impossible
to reflect changes on a file in language L0 into files
in L1,? Ln automatically and faithfully, without
any intermediate structure to bridge the gap,
because that would necessitate at least a perfect
fine-grained aligner in case of changing articles or
common nouns (provided the gender and number
stay the ame in each Li version). In case of
replacing a verb by another with a different valency
frame in a target Li, the sentence in Li would have
to be reanalyzed, transformed accordingly, and
regenerated without introducing any new error or
imprecision, thereby keeping the manual
improvements coming from previous manual
revisions. Or we would need a more than perfect
MT system, namely one which would be able to
analyze the changed utterance in L0, and to transfer
and generate it into a sentence of Li as close as
possible as the previous sentence in Li, which again
could have been improved manually before.
The best and simplest way to go seems to use some
formalized interlingua IL and to
(1) reflect the modifications from L0 to the IL,
(2) regenerate into L1,? Ln from the IL.
We should also allow for direct manual
improvements, considering that the IL form will not
always be present, or not always improvable
enough for lack of expressivity, or that generators
will never be perfect. We choose UNL [3, 4, 10,
11] as our IL of choice for various reasons:
(1) it is specifically designed for linguistic and
semantic machine processing,
(2) it derives with many improvements from
H.Uchida's pivot used in ATLAS-II (Fujitsu)
[13], still evaluated as the best quality MT system
for English-Japanese, with a large coverage
(586,000 lexical entries in each language),
(3) participants of the UNL project1 have built
"deconverters" from UNL into about 12
languages, and at least the Arabic, Indonesian,
Italian, French, Russian, Spanish, and Thai

 http://unl.ias.unu.edu
deconverters were accessible for experimentation
through a web interface at the time of writing,
(4) although formal, UNL graphs (see below) are
quite easy to understand with little training and
may be presented in a "localized" way to naive
users by translating UNL symbols (semantic
relations, attributes) and lexemes (UWs) into
symbols and lexemes of their language,
(5) the UNL project has defined a format embed-
ded in html for files containing a complete
multilingual document aligned at the level of
utterances, and produced a "visualizer" trans-
forming a UNL file into as many html files as
languages, and sending them to any web browser.
The UNL representation of a text is a list of
"semantic graphs", each expressing the meaning of
a natural language utterance. Nodes contain lexical
units and attributes, arcs bear semantic relations.
Connex subgraphs may be defined as "scopes", so
that a UNL graph may be a hypergraph.
The lexical units, called Universal Words (UW),
represent (sets of) word meanings, something less
ambitious than concepts. Their denotations are built
to be intuitively understood by developers knowing
English, that is, by all developers in NLP. AUW is
an English term or special symbol (number?)
possibly completed by semantic restrictions : the
UW "process" represents all word meanings of that
lemma, seen as citation form (verb or noun here),
and "process(icl>do, agt>person)" covers only the
meanings of processing, working on, etc.
The attributes are the (semantic) number, genre,
time, aspect, modality, etc., and the 40 or so
semantic relations are traditional "deep cases" such
as agent, (deep) object, location, goal, time, etc.
One way of looking at a UNL graph corresponding
to an utterance in language L is to say that it
represents the abstract structure of an equivalent
English utterance "seen from L", that is, where
semantic attributes not necessarily expressed in L
may be absent (e.g., aspect coming from French,
determination or number from Japanese, etc.).
We will first present scenarios of increasing internal
complexity for the situation where somebody reads
a UNL document in her language, corrects it, and
wants the corrections to carry over to the corres-
ponding fragment in other languages. We will then
study more precisely the correspondence between a
text in language L0 and its representation in UNL,
and show the advantage of breaking it into 3 parts:
text ? morpho-syntactic lattice or chart ? abstract
"UNL-tree" ? UNL graph. Finally, we present the
current status of this work: an experimentation web
site, a method to establish the second part of the
correspondence, and related research.
1 .  Scenarios for sharing revision across
languages
Suppose a collection of multilingual documents is
stored on a server as multilingual files in UNL-html
format, or in any other form, e.g. in a data base,
provided (1) it is possible to easily produce the
version in any language contained in the document,
(2) the versions are aligned at the level of utterance-
like segments (a segment may contain more than 1
utterance), (3) UNL-graphs may be stored and
aligned with the segments. Here is a slightly
simplified example of a file in UNL-html format.
<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Example 1  El/UNL

</BODY></HTML>
The French versions have been produced
automatically, the German and Chinese manually.
The output of the UNL viewer for French is:
<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>
Example 1  El/UNL
</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>
J?ai couru dans le parc hier.
Mon chien aboya pour moi.
</BODY></HTML>
and will probably be displayed by a browser as:
Example 1  El/UNL
J?ai couru dans le parc hier. Mon chien aboya pour
moi.
and similarly for all other languages. In all
scenarios, the user is reading the text in the normal
display, not seing any tags, and wants to make some
modification, such as moving "hier" after "couru"
and changing "pour" to "vers". Activating some
button or menu item, she enters a revision interface.
1.1 Multiple revision without sharing
In this first scenario, we don't suppose that there are
UNL graphs associated with the segments. The
problem is to transmit and add the user's modifi-
cations to the original form of the multilingual
document. That is impossible by editing the html
documents displayed, because they have no links to
the original form. The UNL-html format predates
XML, hence the special tags like [S] and {unl}, but
we may transform it into an equivalent "UNL-xml"
format. Then, using DOM and javaScript, it is
possible to produce various views: that of a viewer,
a bilingual or multilingual editable presentation,
and a revision (coedition) interface.
This is an example from an experiment performed
for the "Forum Barcelona 2004" on Spanish,
Italian, Russian, French and Hindi.
Hindi and Russian are not shown, but
Japanese has been added by hand. The
XML form is simplified.
Correct sentences are produced by the
deconverters from correct and
complete UNL graphs. We suppose
here that the UNL graph has been
produced from a Chinese version, and
does not countain definiteness and
aspectual information. Now all results
are wrong wrt articles, and some wrt
aspect.

The following interface, designed to be used with sharing, may also be used by a reader knowing several
languages, displayed on demand.
For example, a
nat ive  Spanish
speaker knowing
French and English
would put the
correct articles ("La
ciudad", "La cit?",
"The city", etc.) and
the perfective as-
pect ("habra reco-
brado", "will have
recovered"), but a
native French spea-
ker would probably
not correct the
aspect in English

1.2 Transparent revision with sharing
In the second scenario, there is a UNL graph
associated with the modified segment. In order to
share the revisions across languages, we should
reflect them on the UNL graph, e.g.
? add ".@def" on the nodes "city" & "Forum".
? replace "retrieve" by "recover" and add
".@complete" on the node containing it.
It is not possible in principle to deduce the
modification on the graph from a modification on
the text. For example, replacing "un" ("a") by "le"
("the") does not entail that the following noun is
determined (.@def), because it can also be generic
("il aime la montagne" = "he likes mountains").
Hence, the technique envisaged is that:
? revision is not done by modifying directly the
text, but by using a menu system,
? the menu items have a "language side" and a
hidden "UNL side",
? when a menu item is chosen, only the graph is
transformed, and the action to be done on the text
is stored and shown next to its focus.
? at any time, the new graph may be sent to the
L0 deconverter and the result shown. If is is
satisfactory, that shows that errors were due to the
graph and not to the deconverter, and the graph
may be sent to deconverters in other languages.
Versions in some other languages known by the
user may be displayed, so that improvement
sharing is visible and encouraging.
New versions will be added with appropriate tags
and attributes in the multilingual document in UNL-
xml format, or in a DBMS, so that nothing is lost,
and cooperative working on a document is feasible.
1.3 Revision on more than the texts
For the above method to work, the text has to be
preprocessed, at least by computing morpho-
syntactic classes (POS & actualization attributes) to
avoid many spurious menus, segmenting, and
lemmatizing. Because we want our technique to be
widely applicable, this preprocessing should be
such that it can be performed by large coverage
tools freely available for many languages. That is
the case for morphosyntactic analyzers (MSA), but
not yet for full or even shallow parsers.
We also propose that the revision interface should
allow access not only to the texts, but to editable
representations of the UNL graph, of the result of
the MSA, and of any other available structure such
as a tree derived from the UNL graph.

For users not wanting to see anything else than text,
the previous scenario will always be usable. But
there are good reasons to "open the black box":
(1) the UNL Spanish group has successfully
experimented with an interface for interactive
UNL graph creation using a MSA and a graph
editor showing the UNL graph in a "localized"
way (symbols & lexemes appear in Spanish),
(2) it is sometimes much quicker to change
something on another representation than on a
text: for example, to merge two nodes in order to
change "Mary likes Mary's daughter" into "Mary
likes her daughter",
(3) it may even be necessary, if the correspondence
is faulty and can not be improved because the text
is very far from any reasonable deconversion
obtainable from the graph,
(4) user interface technology has made much
progress, and offers tools to build user-friendly
direct manipulation environments,
(5) last but not least, the younger generation
manipulates complex interfaces very naturally and
expertly, far better than its elders!
1.4 What can and cannot be done
We identify 4 common types of errors in the corpus
we have analysed so far:
(1) graphs containing false information: wrong
attachment, wrong choice of UW, wrong
attribute, wrong semantic relation?
(2) graphs with missing information, as above,
(3) absence of text because the UNL graph is
formally incorrect (due to some wrong human
manipulation, some bug in a deconverter?):
missing parenthesis, missing entry node in a
scope, disconnected graph?,
(4) deconversion errors.
Our method can be used for correcting the first 2
types of errors only. If a graph is formally incorrect,
it may displayable or not. In the first case, it should
be possible to manipulate and correct it graphically,
e.g. by connecting 2 disconnected parts or choosing
an entry node. In the second case, it is necessary to
work on a textual representation. If errors come
from the deconverter, the user may still correct the
text by hand (last zone).
2. Establishing a text?graph correspondence
2.1 The nature of correspondences
The correspondence between a text and a UNL
graph may be decomposed into less complex
liaisons, which are often not simple links, even
between words and nodes. We found the following
types in this case.
MS level UNL graph
lemma
arbre (French)
UW headword
"tree"

2.2 Division in 3 subcorrespondences
We have already begun to break down the
correspondence in 2 parts: text ? MS-structure ?
UNL graph. The MS structure may always be
embedded in a loop-free graph with information on
the nodes (lattice) or on the arcs (charts), so that the
first part of the correspondence is made of liaisons
between substrings of the text (not necessarily
always connex) and elements (nodes or arcs) on the
trajectory corresponding to the preferred
interpretation (in case of ambiguity).
It is perhaps possible to compute a direct
correspondence between the MS lattice and the
UNL graph, but it is not clear how to represent the
liaisons between phrases and subgraphs. For that
purpose, a tree structure is far better. Because there
is no available large-scale and free syntactico-
semantic analyzer for the vast majority of
languages, we can not use even a tree produced by a
shallow parser. But it is possible to associate a
"standard UNL-tree" to any UNL graph by a
reversible algorithmic transformation [3, 4, 10]:
start at the outer entry node, and traverse the graph
and its scopes (subgraphs) recursively, thereby
creating auxiliary nodes for scopes, "inverse"
semantic relations for arcs in the "wrong" direction,
and coindexing symbols to represent reentrancy
without duplication.
We can also take advantage of having one more
structure by enriching it with lexical units of L0.
Now the correspondence is broken into 3 parts:
? text ? MS-L0 (a lattice or a chart),
?  MS-L0 ? UNL-tree+L0 (an unordered
abstract quasi-dependency tree), and
?  UNL-tree+L0 ? UNL-graph (liaisons may be
produced by modifying the standard reversible
graph2tree transformation).
Another advantage of introducing this tree structure
is that the correspondences between strings and
abstract trees have been much studied [5, 15, 16].
They can be encoded within the trees by 2 attributes
expressing what a node covers lexically (SNODE)
and as root of a subtree (STREE).
3. Current status and related research
3.1 Experimental platform
We have implemented a web site called SWIIVRE-
UNL2 (Site on the Web for the Initiation,
Information, Validation, Research and Experi-
mentation on UNL [12]) as an experimental basis
for our research. It currently allows to:
? get dynamic information on UNL sites,
?  access a collection of documents (specs,
articles) on UNL,
?  browse a collection of aligned sentences and
UNL graphs in many languages
? experiment multilingual deconversion,
?  try the first version of a Web and XML-
oriented UNL graph editor, limited to simple
graphs (trees), and programmed using more tags
(UNL-xml-ed), DOM, and javaScript [9].
3.2 Building the lattice-tree correspondence
Let us outline the method (currently under
implementation) to compute a "best" corres-
pondence. We start with an MS-L0 lattice linked to
the text and a UNL-tree produced in a standard way
and linked to the UNL graph. The goal is to
establish liaisons between the lattice and the tree,
and to order the tree so that it is maximally aligned
with the lattice, hence with the text. Suppose we
have only an L0-English dictionary.
First, we enrich the lattice with English lemmas
and the UNL-tree with lemmas of L0, producing
MS-L0+EN and UNL-tree+L0. Then, we establish
links between nodes of the lattice and of the tree
having lemmas in common (in L0 or in English),
and compute a score for each trajectory in the
lattice. The best trajectory is chosen.
The next phase consists in aligning the tree with
that trajectory, using "sure" links as the point of
departure, and constraints on the STREE and
SNODE liaisons: if there are crossing links, which
is possible if two words in the text have similar
meanings, preference is given to the link
maximizing the proximity in the tree and in the
string. Then, liaisons of other types are established:

3.3 Related research
Sending feedback automatically to developers is
already done in some MT systems, notably in
Taiwan (EKS) and at PAHO [14], but should be
much more used than it is. The idea of coedition is
also not new: UPM in Madrid uses it to create UNL
graphs, Y. Lepage at ATR and Tang E. K. at USM
(Penang)  have developed editors of string-tree
correspondences, Watanabe at IBM-Japan has a
very nice interface to edit from a text its underlying
dependency structure, the MULTIMETEO system
[8] is in effect a coedition system for weather
forecasts and their underlying semantic structure, in
6 languages, and there is a project at Xerox working
on multilingual generation and free text
normalization in restricted domains and typologies
(pharmaceutical notices).
In our case, by contrast, coedition is to happen at
the consumer side, not (like at UPM) at the produ-
cer side, and there is no specific domain or
typology. The idea to derive an abstract semantic
tree from an IL representation using alignment
techniques and not a rule system embedded in a
generator seems also to be new.
Conclusion
Coedition of a natural language text and its
representation in some interlingual form seems the
best way to share text revision across languages.
UNL graphs seem to be the best candidates in this
context. We have described an approach where, in
the simplest sharing scenario, naive users interact
directly with the text in their language (L0), and
indirectly with the associated graph. It should also
be possible to view and directly manipulate the
given UNL graph, a lattice or chart produced by
some available free morphosyntactic analyzer, and
an abstract tree produced not by analysis, but by a
standard transformation from the UNL graph,
followed by lexical enrichment in L0, and
alignment with the text. When completed, our
implementation will make it possible to share
revision across languages. We will then have
progressed towards merging pivot MT, interactive
MT, and multilingual text authoring.
