The two-level model of Koskenniemi which relates 
graphemlc to  morpho log ica l  s t ruc ture  has been

Xn EUROTRA a so lu t ion  which combines 
morpho log ica l  and sur face  syntact i c  p rocess ing  in 
one CFG implemented in a un i f i ca t ion  grammar 
framework has been tried out. This article

O. INTRODUCTION 
The deve lopment  of  soph is t i ca ted  NLP 
app l i ca t ions  has c reated  a need for spec i f i c  
p rocess ing  in o rder  to  be ab le  to  cope w i th  la rge  
vocabu lar ies  w i thout  c reat ing  monst ruous  
d ic t ionar ies .  Ear l ie r  approaches  o f ten  avo ided 
morphology more or less  by l i s t ing  fu l l  wordforms 
in the d ic t ionary  or by s imply  segment ing  some 
in f lec t iona l  end ings  w i th  a few genera l  ru les .  
Much recent  work i s  based on the  Two- leve l  Model 
(Koskenniemi ,  1983) and re la tes  d i rec t ly  or 
ind i rec t ly  to  the  or ig ina l  imp lementat ion  of  th i s  
model in the  form of f in i te  s ta te  t ransducers  
(FST). The or ig ina l  nota t ion  and imp lementat ion  
have been fu r ther  deve loped and re f ined  (c f .  e .g .  
B lack,  1986 and Bear,  1986) in o rder  to improve 
compi la t ion  and runt ime,  debugging and 
ru le -wr i t ing  fac i l i t i es .  
S t i l l  some problems pers i s t  and o thers  have not  
been touched yet .  Th is  paper  p resents  an 
a l te rnat ive ,  but  not  cont rad ic tory ,  so lu t ion  
which has to  some extent  been t r ied  out  in the  
EUROTRA Machine Trans la t ion  P ro jec t  and argues  
that  the two- leve l  approach may not  be ent i re ly  
v iab le  in a decent ra l i sed  R&D pro jec t  which aims 
at  ~he c reat ion  of a b ig mul t i l i ngua l  HT sys tem.  
I. THE TWO-LEVEL MODEL 
The or ig ina l  p resentat ion  of  the  model 
(Koskenniemi ,  1983) shows that  i t  i s  poss ib le  to  
t reat  the  in f lec t iona l  morphology ( inc lud ing  
spe l l ing  ru les )  of a h igh ly  in f lec ted  language 
l i ke  F inn ish  by es tab l i sh ing  cor respondences  
between a surface alphabet and a lexical alphabet 
(the two levels) and using a lexicon to determine 
which combinations of characters and morphemes 
are legal. Moreover, this is done by means of 
declarative rules, thereby avoiding the 
procedural problems of generative phonology, and 
the algorithm used is language independent. 
Together with the fact that the model may bc used 
for synthesis as well as for analysis this is a 
strong argument in favour of employing a 
two-level approach to morphology. 
Later  work po in ts  to some impor tant  shor tcomings  
of the  o r ig ina l  imp lementat ion  of  the  model in 
the loom of FST's (Black, 1986). Especially 
compi la t ion  and runt ime requ i rements  and 
debugging are  seen to pose severe  prob lems.  In 
B lack ' s  words :"Debugging automata  i s  remin iscent  
of  debugging assembly  language progranuuing in 
hex" .  Cons ider ing  that  the  ( l ingu is t i c )  user  is  
interested in the rules rather than in the 
low-level implementation of them, Black et al 
have proceeded to develop high-level notations in 
the form of rules which are interpreted directly, 
instead of being compiled into FST's. 
Nonetheless, they entirely respect the two-level 
approach in their notation. Their rules still 
establish correspondences between, on one side, 
elements of a lexical alphabet (the characters of 
the natural language alphabet plus the empty 
character  (if), the  morpheme boundary (+) ,  and 
arch iphonemes (noted  as cap i ta l  l e t te rs ) )  and, on 
the  o ther  s ide ,  the  e lements  of a sur face  
a lphabet  (the characters  of the natura l  language 
p lus  the empty character ) ,  and they  use a lex icon  
to determine  which combinat ions  of characters  
make up lega l  morphemes. The i r  work shows the 
re la t ive  independence of  the  ru le  fo rmal i sm from 
its implementation - accepting the two-level 
model by no means forces one to accept FST's as 
an implementation vehicle - and it shows that the 
rules for combination of characters (spelling 
rules or morpho-graphemics) are best treated in 
i so la t ion  from the  ru les  fo r  combinat ion  of  
morphemes (morpho-syntax) .  
Th is  l a t te r  approach has been fu r ther  deve loped 
by Bear (Bear ,  1986).  He combines a two- leve l  
approach to morpho-graphemics  wi th  a un i f i ca t ion  
grammar approach (a mod i f ied  PATE  ru le  
interpreter) to morpho-syntax. The resulting 
19 
imp lementat ion  preserves  the genera l i ty  and 
f lex ib i l i ty  of  the  t reatment  of  morpho-graphemic  
phenomena l i ke  a l lomorphy wh i le ,  a t  the  same 
t ime,  avo id ing  the problems of t reat ing  
morpho-syntax  in the  lex icon ,  which in rea l i ty  i s  
what happens in Koskenn iemi ' s  o r ig ina l  model 
where the lex ica l  ent r ies  fo r  root  morphemes are 
marked fo r  "cont inuat ion  c lasses"  ( re fe rences  to 
sub- lex icons  which determine  the  lega l  
combinat ions  of  morphemes).  
Furthermore, by t reat ing  morpho-syntax  in a 
un i f i ca t ion  grammar framework, Bear obta ins  an 
e f fec t  which i s  very  impor tant  p rov ided  that  
morpho log ica l  ana lys i s  and synthes i s  are normal ly  
regarded  as e lements  or modules of  sys tems which 
a l so  do o ther  k inds  of  language  process ing ,  e .g .  
syntact i c  pars ing :  He reaches  a s tage  where the  
output  of  the  morpho log ica l  ana lyser  i s  someth ing  
which can eas i l y  be used by a parsee  or some 
other  program (Bear ,  1986, p. 275).  
S t i l l ,  one must  admit  that  on ly  subsets  of  
morphology have been t reated  w i th in  the  two- leve l  
framework and i t s  successors .  Most of  the  work 
seems to have cent red  on in f lec t iona l  morphology 
w i th  a few excurs ions  in to  der ivat ion  and a to ta l  
exc lus ion  of compounding which i s  a very  
impor tant  phenomenon in languages  l i ke  German, 
Dutch and Danish .  I t  i s  a l so  notewor thy  that  none 
of  the  imp lementat ions  ment ioned  above cou ld  be 
used fo r  the  ana lys i s  (or  synthes i s )  of  runn ing  
text  because  they  know no cap i ta l  l e t te rs ,  no 
numbers ,  no punctuat ion  marks or spec ia l  
characters ,  nor  fo rmat t ing  in fo rmat ion .  Th is  does 
not  mean that  such th ings  cou ld  not  be taken  care  
of  in combinat ion  w i th  a two- leve l  framework ( fo r  
ins tance  by a pre -processor  of  some k ind) ,  i t  
jus t  means that  in o rder  to  cater  fo r  them one 
needs new k inds  of  nota t ions  and imp lementat ions  
(as numbers could  hard ly  be ana lysed  as lex icon  
ent r ies )  w i th  the cor respond ing  in ter fac ing  
problems (cf. Bear's motivation for using a 
un i f i ca t ion  grammar fo r  morpho-syntax) .  
IT. THE EUROTRA BASE LEVEL 
I .  BackKround 
EUROTRA i s  a decent ra l i sed  R & D pro jec t  
a iming at  the  deve lopment  of  a mul t i l i nEua l  
machine translation system. Thus, on top of the 
c lass ica l  coder cons is tency  problems known from 
the  deve lopment  of  b ig  )ST sys tems l i ke  SYSTRAN, 
EUROTRA has to ensure  cons is tency  of  work done in 
some 20 geograph ica l ly  d i spersed  s i tes .  Th is  
ca l l s  fo r  a s t rong ,  coherent ,  unders tandab le ,  
problem or iented  and comprehens ive  framework.  
Cons ider ing  a l so  that  the  so f tware  deve lopment  in 
the  pro jec t  i s  supposed to be based on rap id  
pro to typ ing ,  i t  becomes c lear  that  the  pro jec t  
has to bu i ld  on some genera l  idea about  how 
th ings  w i l l  f i t  together  in the  end.  We cannot  
a f fo rd  to bu i ld  independent  modules (e .g .  an FST 
imp lementat ion  of  a morpho log ica l  component ,  a 
PATR-II grammar for our syntactic component 
implemented in PROLOG, some SNOBOL programming 
for the treatment of text formatting, special 
characters  e tc ,  and a re la t iona l  database  fo r  our 
d ic t ionar ies )  and then  s tar t  car ing  about  the  
compat ib i l i ty  of  these  modules a f te rwards .  
Consequently, the EUROTRA base level which treats 
all kinds of characters (alpha-numeric, special, 
control etc.) and morphemes and words has been 
conceived as a part of the general EUROTRA 
framework and described in the same notation as 
the syntactic and semantic components. 
In  the  absence of  a ded icated  user  language 
(which i s  be in  E deve loped now) the  EUROTRA 
notation is the language of the virtual EUROTRA 
machine. This virtual machine stipulates a series 
Of so-called generators (G's) linked by sets of 
translation rules (t-rules). Each generator 
builds a representation of the source text (in 
analysis) or the target text (in synthesis) and 
it is the job of the linguists who are building 
the translation system to use these generators in 
such a way that they construct linguistically 
relevant levels of representation (e.g. 
morphological, syntactic constituent, syntatic 
relation and semantic representations). The 
individual generators are unification grammars 
consisting of const ruc tors  which are basically 
functions with a fixed number of arguments and 
atoms which are constructors with no arguments. 
An atom has the form 
(name,~feature descr ip t ion~)  
The feature  descr ip t ion  i s  a se t  of  
a t t r ibute -va lue  pa i rs  ( features )  wi th one 
d i s t ingu ished  feature ,  ca l led  the  name, which i s  
caracter i s t i c  fo r  each generator  (e .g . ,  fo r  the  
sur face  syntact i c  generator  i t  would be syntact i c  
ca tegory) .  The name i s  p laced  outs ide  the cur ly  
b rackets ,  and on ly  the  va lue  i s  g iven .  
A constructor has the form 
HEAD A R G U M E N T S  
where the n=name and fd=feature  descr ip t ion .  In 
functional terms this represents a function 
(descr ibed  by the head) over  n a rguments .  
The t-rules relate the representation built by a 
generator to the atoms and constructors of the 
subsequent G, thereby making it possible for this 
G to build a new representation of the 
translation of the elements of the preceding one 
in a compositional way (cf. EUROTRA literature 
(2,3 and 4) in the reference list). 
The v i r tua l  machine has been implemented in 
PROLOG and an Ear ly - type  parser  has been used to 
bu i ld  the  f i r s t  representat ion  in ana lys i s  
(viewed as a tree-structure over the input 
strins). This implementation, of course, 
20 
represents  a cho ice .  Other programming  languages  
and parsers  might  have  been used .  The sys tem 
implemented  by Bear ,  e .g .  ind icates  that  a 
two- leve l  approach  to  morpho-graphemica  may be 
combined w i th  a un i f i ca t ion  granuuar approach  to  
morpho-syntax .  For  var ious  reasons ,  though we 
have  not  chosen  th i s  so lu t ion .  
2. Text  s t ruc ture  and lex ico~raph ic  
cons is tency  
The f i r s t  ser ious  prob lems encountered  in  
choos ing  a two- leve l  approach  to  morpho logy  in  an 
MT sys tem i s  the  quest ion  o f  what  to  do w i th  a l l  
those  characters  wh ich  are  not  le t te rs .  I f  we 
f ind  a p iece  o f  text  l i ke  
A. Th is  quest ion  w i l l  be d i scussed  w i th  the  
D i rec tor  Genera l  on Apr i l  25th .  
we do not  want  an ana lys i s  wh ich  te l l s  us  that  
the  sys tem has  found  4 nouns  (one be ing  a 
'p roper '  noun), 3 verbs  (one f in i te ,  two 
i n f in i tes ) ,  two determiners ,  two prepos i t ions  and 
some unintell igible elements which another 
machine wil l  have to take care of. We want to 
know that "Director General" is a compound which, 
syntact i ca l l y ,  behaves  l i ke  a s ing le  noun ,  that  
"Apr i l  25th"  i s  a date  (because  i t  may be a 
t ime-mod i f ie r  o f  a sentence) ,  that  "A" i s  an 
index  wh ich  ind icates  some enumerat ive  s t ruc ture  
o f  the  text ,  that  " . "  i s  a punctuat ion  mark  wh ich  
may ind icate  that  a sentence  ends  here ,  and 
probab ly  more in fo rmat ion  wh ich  we need i f  we 
want  to  bu i ld  a representat ion  o f  the  who le  text  
and not  jus t  o f  some se lec ted  words  o r  s imp le  
sentences .  
I t  seems d i f f i cu l t  to  see  how the  two- leve l  
approach  cou ld  cope w i th  compounds ,  apar t  f rom 
enter ing  them a l l  in to  the  lex icon ,  and th i s  
would rea l ly  he a heavy  burden  on the  lex icon  o f  
compounding languages .  S ing le  le t te rs  l l ke  "A . "  
and even punctuat ion  marks  might  be inc luded  in  
the  lex icon ,  but  numbers  cou ld  not  fo r  obv ious  
reasons .  
Fur thermore ,  cont ro l  and escape  sequences  wh ich  
determine  most  o f  the  text  s t ruc ture  ( font ,  
d iv i s ion  into chapters ,  sec t ions ,  paragraphs  
e tc . )  in  any ed i to r  or  word processor  might  be 
entered  in to  the  lex icon ,  but  the  two- leve l  
approach  does  not  p rov ide  any so lu t ion  to  the  
prob lem of g iv ing  these  sequences  an 
in terpreta t ion  wh ich  i s  use fu l  in  bu i ld ing  a 
representat ion  o f  the  text  s t ruc ture .  
In  o rder  to  cope w i th  these  prob lems,  we have  
chosen ,  in  EUROTRA, to  de f ine  the  input  and the  
output  o f  the  sys tem as extended ASCII f i l es .  The 
ASCII characters ,  inc lud ing  numbers ,  spec ia l  and 
cont ro l  characters ,  a re  de f ined  as the  atoms o f  
the  f i r s t  leve l  o f  representat ion  and thereby  
prov ided  w i th  an in terpreta t ion  wh ich  makes i t  
poss ib le  fo r  them to  serve  as a rguments  o f  
const ruc tors  wh ich  bu i ld  a t ree -s t ruc ture  
represent ing  the  text  and a l l  i t s  e lements ,  a l so  
those  e lements  which  are  not  words .  
The second prob lem in  the  two- leve l  approach  i s  
that ,  apar t  f rom the  fac t  that  some textua l  
e lements  seem to  be to ta l l y  outs ide  the  scope  o f  
the  lex icon ,  even  those  e lements  wh ich  go in to  
the  lex icon  pose  a ser ies  o f  p rob lems in  our  
context .  
For MT to  be o f  any use  and e f f i c iency  we need 
la rge  d ic t ionar ies  wh ich  cover  a substant ia l  par t  
o f  the  vocabu lar ies  o f  those  languages  t reated  by 
the MT system. It is known from a lot of MT 
systems that the coding of large dictionaries (or 
l ex ica )  cannot  be le f t  to  a smal l  g roup  o f  peop le  
work ing  together  in  c lose  contact  fo r  a l im i ted  
per iod  o f  t ime.  Many coders  work ing  over  long  
per iods  a re  needed,  and they  w i l l  constant ly  be 
mainta in ing ,  rev i s ing  and up-dat ing  the  work o f  
one another .  For  such  an enterpr i se  to  succeed  
one needs  ext remely  s t rong  and deta i led  
gu ide l ines  fo r  cod ing ,  and the  cod ing  language 
shou ld  be as s imp le  and t ransparent  as  poss ib le  
and conta in  no content ious  e lements  f rom a 
theoret i ca l  po in t  o f  v iew.  Morpheme boundar ies ,  
a rch iphonemes  and nu l l - characters  a re  hard ly  
uncontent ious  in  the  sense  that ,  e .g .  everybody  
agrees  on the  root  fo rm to  employ  in ' reduct ion '  
( ' reduce '  or  ' reduc '  ? ) ,  and even  the  s l ightes t  
d i sagreement  w i l l  i nvar iab ly  jeopard ize  the  
in tercoder  cons is tency  wh ich  i s  abso lu te ly  
necessary  fo r  an MT pro jec t  to  succeed .  
3. Character  normal i za t ion  and morpheme 
ident i f i ca t ion  
The atoms of the base level identify and 
interpret the characters of the input file in 
that the name of the atom unifies with the input 
character  ( fo r  non-pr ln tab le  characters  
hexadec ima l  nota t ion  in  quotes  i s  used) :  
( A, { type  = le t te r ,  subtype  = vowe l ,  char=a,  
case  = upper~)  
( k, ~ type  = le t te r ,  subtype  = vowe l ,  char=a,  
case  lower ,  accent  = grave~)  
( ' IB ' ,  ~type  = cont ro l _char ,  subtype  = escape~ ) 
In  a un i f i ca t ion  granuuar wh ich  a l lows  the  use  o f  
named and anonymous var iab les ,  i t  i s  easy  to  jo in  
all variants of the letter 'a' under one heading 
(a constructor in EUROTRA terms) and percolate 
all relevant features to this beading by means of 
feature-passing. This is called normalisatlon in 
our tet~us, and it simply means that all 
typographical variants of a character are 
collapsed so that the dictionary will only have 
to contain one character type. A normalizing 
const ruc tor  fo r  'a  t cou ld  be:  
21 
(a ,  ~type  = le t te r ,  subtype  = vowe l ,  case  = X, 
accent  = Y~)  
( ' ? ,  ~char  = a,  case  = X, accent  = Y})~ 
where  ' ? '  i s  the  anonymous var iab le .  The argument  
o f  th i s  const ruc tor  w i l l  un i fy  w i th  any a tom 
conta in ing  the  feature  ' char  = a '  and accept  the  
va lues  fo r  ' case '  and 'accent '  found  in  these  
a toms.  By feature -pass ing  these  va lues  w i l l  then  
be perco la ted  to  the  head .  
At th i s  s tage  the  representat ion  o f  the  input  
f i l e  i s  a sequence  o f  normal i sed  characters .  Th is  
sequence  i s  now matched  aga ins t  the  d ic t ionary  o r  
lex icon  wh ich  i s  Jus t  another  se t  o f  const ruc tors  
o f  the  fo rm

I f ,  O ,  r~ 
( fo r ,  ~ c lass  = bas ic  word,  type  = pre f ix ,  
parad igm = der ivat ion  ~ ) 
I f ,  o , r J  
Match ing  here  means the  k ind  o f  match ing  wh ich  
occurs  in  un i f i ca t ion .  Th is  means ,  o f  course ,  
that  the  overgenerat ion  may be severe  in  some 
case ,  e .g .  each  o f  the  ' s '  appear ing  in  
M iss i ss ipp i  w i l l  i . a .  be in terpreted  as  a p lu ra l  
morpheme.  Th is  overgenerat ion  must  be 
const ra ined .  We are  work ing  w i th  th i s  p rob lem and 
some resu l t s  a re  ready ,  wh ich  conf i rm that  our  
approach  to  character  normal i sa t ion  and 
d ic t ionary  look -up ,  i .e .  the  one descr ibed  above ,  
p rov ides  fo r  a s t ra ight - fo rward ,  s t r i c t  and yet  
per fec t ly  unders tandab le  and uncont rovers ia l

features  and the  co -occur r rence  const ra in ts  
ho ld ing  between those  features  a re  de f ined  in  
advance .  What the  d ic t ionary  coder  has  to  do i s  
to  choose  the  re levant  features  fo r  each  lex ica l  
i tem (bas ic  word in  our  te rmino logy)  and wr i te  
them in to  the  re levant  const ruc tor  wh ich  w i l l  
operate  in  to ta l  independence  o f  any o ther  
const ruc tor .  There  w i l l  be no prob lems w i th  
l ink ing  sub- lex icons  o r  d i scuss ing  morpheme 
boundar ies ,  because  each  const ruc tor  operates  
d i rec t ly  on the  sequence  o f  sur face  characters ,  
i . e .  the  prob lem o f  whether  the  sur face  fo rm o f  
'ab i l i ty '  i s  a b i 1 ~ ' i  t y o r  
a b i 1 ~ ~ i t y does  not  ex i s t  ( c f .  B lack  
1986,  p. 16) .  The ensu ing  prob lems in  re la t ion  to  
the  t reatment  o f  a l lomorphy  are  exposed  be low.  
4. Imp lementat ion  
The EUROTRA Base Leve l  has  been imp lemented  
by means  o f  a p ro to type  vers ion  o f  the  v i r tua l  
mach ine  imp lemented  in  PEOLOG wi th  an Ear ly - type  
parser .  Th is  p ro to type  was const ruc ted  in  such  a 
way that  the  parser  would  on ly  work in  one o f  the  
generators ,  i . e .  the  f i r s t  generator  employed  in  
ana lys i s ,  wh i le  the  o ther  generators  wou ld  
produce  t rans forms o f  the  t ree -s t ruc ture  bu i l t  by 
the  f i r s t  generator .  
Due to  th i s  const ra in t ,  we had to  co l lapse  
morpho-syntax  and sur face  syntax  in to  one 
generator  wh ich  bu i l t  a t ree  over  the  sequence  o f  
characters  o f  the  input  f i l e  v ia  normal i zed  
characters ,  bas ic  words ,  complex  words  
( in f lec ted ,  der ived  and compound word forms) ,  
phrasa l  nodes  (NP, VP, PP e tc . )  and end ing  a t  an 
S top  node .  The resu l t ing  grannnars  became very  
b ig ,  and tes t ing  in  most  cases  had to  be done 
w i th  sub-grammars  in  o rder  to  p revent  load ing  and 
pars ing  t imes  f rom becoming  proh ib i t i ve .  
Ac tua l  imp lementat ion  work was done in  5 
languages  (Eng l i sh ,  German,  Dutch ,  Dan ish  and 
Greek) ,  and severa l  sub-grammars  were 
success fu l l y  imp lemented  and tes ted .  The most  
impor tant  exper ience  was that  the  d i f fe rent

5. The base  leve ls  
The l ingu is t i c  spec i f i ca t ions  o f  th i s  
sys tem,  wh ich  i s  to  be imp lemented  in  the  present  
phase  o f  the  pro jec t ,  have  been  e laborated  in  
some deta i l .  The input  to  the  sys tem wi l l  be 
f i l es  conta in ing  characters  in  a 7 o r ,  
p re ferab ly ,  8 b i t  code ( in  o rder  to  cover  the  
mul t i l i ngua l  EOROTRA env i ronment ) .  The characters  
un i fy  w i th  atoms o f  the  type  descr ibed  above .  The 
atoms then  un i fy  with abst rac t  word form,  
sentence, paragraph etc. constructors of the 
following kind: 
22 
(wordform) /~+(?, { type  = le t te r}  )~ 
(sentence)  \[ + wordform, (?,  
~type  = punctuat ion_mark~ )1
(paragraph) \[ + sentenc_e, ( f in  paragraph,  
? ~char ffi double CR} ) 
where ? is  s t i l l  the anonymous var iab le ,  '+ '  is  
the Kleene plus s ign i fy ing  one or more of the 
fo l lowing argument and 'double car r iage  re turn '  
is  assumed to be the character  (or sequence) 
ind icat ing  te rminat ion  of a paragraph in the text .  
These abst rac t  const ruc tors  w i l l  bu i ld  a 
t ree -s t ruc ture  represent ing  the fu l l  input  text  
from the characters  v ia  the words, the sentences ,  
the paragraphs, the sections etc. to a top T(ext) 
node, of course with some overgeneration, e.g. 
some punctuation marks do not terminate a 
sentence, but the overgeneration will be filtered 
out by subsequent generators  us ing morpho log ica l ,  
syntact i c  and semantic information. 
The generator  fo l low ing  the f i r s t  ( text  
s t ruc ture)  leve l  w i l l  normal ise the characters  by 
a many-to-one mapping of ,  e .g .  var iants  of 'a ' ,  
and a l l  the bas ic  words of the system component 
(e .g .  the Engl ish ana lys i s  component), i . e .  the 
major part  of the monol ingual  d ic t ionary ,  w i l l  be 
present in this generator in the form of 
constructors (cf. the 'for' constructor mentioned 
above). This will cause some overgeneration as 
illustrated above with the example 'M iss i ss ipp i '  
but an abst rac t  wordform const ruc tor  which is  
connected by a t - ru le  to the representat ions  
bu i l t  by the abst rac t  wordform const ruc tor  of the 
previous (text structure) level will filter out 
spurious results: 
(wordform) ~ +(?, \ [ c lass  = bas ic_word~)~ 
Given that  'm i ' ,  ' i '  and ' ipp i '  are not a l l  bas ic  
words of English, no interpretation of the 's' as 
plural or third person singular markers will be 
al lowed, because each wordform has to cover  
exact ly  one sequence of bas ic  words exhaust ive ly  
without over lapp ing .  
Assuming that  'M iss i ss ipp i '  is  a bas ic  word of 
Engl ish present  in the d ic t ionary  (as a 
constructor of this level), the sequence of 
normalised characters 'mississippi' will receive 
at least one legal interpretation which is then 
translated into the subsequent (morpho-syntactlc) 
level by a t-rule. 
The t reatment  of a l lomorphic  var ia t ion  in th i s  
approach w i l l  re ly  on a l te rnat ing  arguments in 
the bas ic  word const ruc tors .  In order  to cover 
the a l te rnat ion  y - ie  found in,  e .g . ,  c i ty  - -~  
c i t ies '  we sha l l  have to use a bas ic  word 
constructor of the following form: 
(c i ty ,  ~ ~)  ~c ,  i ,  t ,  ( i ; y ) \ ]  
where ';' is the alternation operator. This 
constructor will unify with any of the two 
sequences ' c i t i '  and ' c i ty ' ,  and i f  we c reate  two 
bas ic  word const ruc tors  over  the p lu ra l  ending of 
nouns (cover ing  at  the same time the th i rd  person 
s ingu lar  of the present  tense of verbs ) ,  i . e .  (s) 
and (es ) ,  e .g .  
we may cover the wordform 'c i t ies '  by (c i t i )  and 
(es ) .  A de f in i te  advantage of us ing th i s  approach 
is that  i t  covers a l lomorphic  var ia t ion  ins ide  
the root  form l i ke  in German p lura l  of nouns: 
Mann - -> M~nner 
by (mann,{ ~) I ra ,  (a, ~), n, n J  
The only way of cover ing th i s  phenomenon in the 
two- leve l  approach seems to be by enter ing  both 
'Mann' and 'M~nn' in to  the d ic t ionary  as poss ib le  
roots. 
The generator  fo l low ing  the leve l  where bas ic  
word ident i f i ca t ion  takes p lace conta ins ,  as i t s  
atoms, the bas ic  words t rans la ted  by t - ru les  from 
the representations built by the basic word 
constructors. The characters, which are the atoms 
of the previous level, are cut off by receiving a 
0 translation. 
The constructors of this generator are wordform 
(or complex word) constructors covering the 
var ious  inflectional paradigms, the different 
classes of derivation and compounding. The 
following constructor would build representations 
of all French verbs of the regular er-paradigm in 
the infinitive, including the information that 
these representations may be used as arguments of 
constructors over future and conditional forms 
(which include the infinitive): 
(V, Jclass = wordform, cat = v, lexical unit = X, 
verbfomu = infinitive, 
inflectional_class = regu lar_verb  er ,  
inflectlonal_paradigm = inf_cond_fut ~ ) 
iX ,  ~c lass  = bas ic  word, type = lex ,  
--inflectional_~lass = reg_verb_er~)  
(e r ,{c lass  = bas ic  word, type = in f lec t ion ,  
in f lec t iona l  c lass  = reg_verb_er ,  ~)  
in f lec t iona l _parad igm = in f_cond_ fut~ J 
23 
The const ruc tor  over cond i t iona l  forms w i l l  take 
th i s  representat ion  p lus  a bas ic  word 
represent ing  a cond i t iona l  end ing as i t s  
a rguments ,  and the f ina l  representat ion  o f ,  e .g .  
' a imera is '  w i l l  be equ iva lent  to a t ree  wi th  a l l  
re levant  in fo rmat ion  perco la ted  to the  top node: 
v / \  
v a i s  / \  
aim er  
The morpho-syntact i c  generator  bu i lds  the  same 
k ind of  representat ions  of  der ivat ions  and 
compounds. The leaves  of  the  t rees  always 
cor respond to bas ic  words,  and consequent ly ,  th i s  
generator  w i l l  bu i ld  representat ions  o f ,  e .g .  a l l  
compounds the e lements  of  which are present  in 
the  bas ic  word ident i f i ca t ion  generator :  
hand ba l l  n,  der ivat ion  / \  
mann schaf t  
The morpho-syntaet i c  representat ions  are  
t rans la ted  in to  the fo l low ing  (sur face  syntact i c )  
leve l  in such a way that  wordforms which are 
exhaust ive ly  descr ibed  by the i r  top node 
( invar iant  words,  in f lec t ions  and some 
der ivat ions  l i ke  the  agent ive  (e .g .  ' sw immer ' ) )  
appear  as atoms,  wh i le  a l l  o thers  (a l l  o ther  
der ivat ions  and compounds) appear  as s t ruc ture  
(const ruc tors )  wi th  the re levant  categor ia l  
in fo rmat ion  in the  top node: 
n, der ivat ion  a t ion(n ,  der ivat ion)  
inv i te  a t ion  inv i te  Iv) 
At subsequent  deep syntact i c  or semant ic  leve ls  
in fo rmat ion  from other  nodes of  the  word t ree  may 
be needed.  Th is  can be prov ided  by le t t ing  
t - ru les  t rans form the t ree  in such a way that  the  
re levant  in fo rmat ion  goes to the  top node (e .g .  
i f  the frame of the root  of  a der ivat ion  i s  
needed fo r  semant ic  purposes ,  the  root  features  
are moved to  the top of  the t ree) .  In th i s  way 
re levant  morpho log ica l  in fo rmat ion  w i l l  a lways be 
ava i lab le  when i t  i s  needed:  
a t ion  (n,  der ivat ion)  inv i te  (v) 
! > I 
i nv i te  Iv) a t ion  (n,  der ivat ion)  
The resu l t ing  t ree  i s  used in a deep syntact i c  or 
semant ic  generator  where the  in fomuat ion  that  
th i s  e lement  was or ig ina l ly  a der ived  noun i s  
i r re levant ,  because  the e lement  has  a l ready  been 
p laced in the  overa l l  s t ruc ture  on the  bas i s  of  
th i s  in fo rmat ion .  Nonethe less ,  the  'a t ion ' -node  
i s  not cut  o f f ,  because  i t  i s  re levant  fo r  
t rans fer  to  know that  a verb -noun der ivat ion  and 
not  jus t  a verb i s  be ing  t rans la ted .  
I I I .  CONCLUSION 
The EUROTRA base  leve ls  bu i ld  a fu l l  
representat ion  of  the  text  s t ruc ture  by t reat ing  
a l l  characters  of  the  input  f i l e  inc lud ing  
spec ia l  and cont ro l  characters .  They normal i se  
the  characters  in such a way that  the  sys tem 
d ic t ionary  may funct ion  independent ly  of  lay -out ,  
font  and o ther  typograph ic  var ia t ions .  They 
prov ide  separate  t reatments  of  morpho-graphemics  
and morpho-syntax ,  and the  representat ions  of  the  
words are  of  such a k ind that  they  may be used 
not  on ly  fo r  syntact i c ,  but  a l so  fo r  semant ic  
p rocess ing .  
At the  same t ime,  the  d ic t ionary  ent r ies  are 
s imple  bas ic  word const ruc tors  over  sequences  of  
characters .  No spec i f i c  phono log ica l  knowledge i s  
requ i red  fo r  the cod ing of  these  ent r ies ,  and so 
a poss ib le  source  of  incons is tency  among coders  
i s  avo ided.  
The fac t  that  EUROTRA const ruc tors  c lose ly  
resemble  t rad i t iona l  rewr i te  ru les  tosether  w i th  
the coocur rence  res t r i c t ions  imposed by the 
EUROTRA feature  theory  a l lev ia tes  the debugg ing  
of  grammars and d ic t ionar ies .  No rea l  prograr~nin$ 
exper ience  in the c lass ica l  sense  i s  needed.  The 
const ruc tors ,  however,  do not  imply 
und i rec t iona l i ty  l i ke  the ru les  of generat ive  
phonology.  They work equa l ly  we l l  both ways, and 
consequent ly ,  they  serve  fo r  ana lys i s  as we l l  as 
fo r  synthes i s .  The const ruc tors  of  a generator  
a l l  apply  in para l le l ,  thereby  avo id ing  the  k ind 
of  in te rac t ion  which i s  typ ica l  of  o rdered sets  
of  ru les .  
Th is  des ign ,  in our  op in ion ,  p rov ides  a good set  
of  too l s  fo r  ensur ing  cons is tent  imp lementat ion  
of grantnars and d ic t ionar ies  across  a 
decent ra l i sed  and mul t i l i nsua l  MT pro jec t .
