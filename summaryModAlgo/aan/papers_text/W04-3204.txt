Abstract
This paper explores the large-scale acquisition of
sense-tagged examples for Word Sense Disam-
biguation (WSD). We have applied the ?WordNet
monosemous relatives? method to construct auto-
matically a web corpus that we have used to train
disambiguation systems. The corpus-building pro-
cess has highlighted important factors, such as the
distribution of senses (bias). The corpus has been
used to train WSD algorithms that include super-
vised methods (combining automatic and manually-
tagged examples), minimally supervised (requiring
sense bias information from hand-tagged corpora),
and fully unsupervised. These methods were tested
on the Senseval-2 lexical sample test set, and com-
pared successfully to other systems with minimum
or no supervision.
1 Introduction
The results of recent WSD exercises, e.g. Senseval-
21 (Edmonds and Cotton, 2001) show clearly that
WSD methods based on hand-tagged examples are
the ones performing best. However, the main draw-
back for supervised WSD is the knowledge acqui-
sition bottleneck: the systems need large amounts
of costly hand-tagged data. The situation is more
dramatic for lesser studied languages. In order to
overcome this problem, different research lines have
been explored: automatic acquisition of training ex-
amples (Mihalcea, 2002), bootstrapping techniques
(Yarowsky, 1995), or active learning (Argamon-
Engelson and Dagan, 1999). In this work, we have
focused on the automatic acquisition of examples.
When supervised systems have no specific train-
ing examples for a target word, they need to rely on
publicly available all-words sense-tagged corpora
like Semcor (Miller et al, 1993), which is tagged
with WordNet word senses. The systems perform-
ing best in the English all-words task in Senseval-2
were basically supervised systems trained on Sem-
cor. Unfortunately, for most of the words, this cor-
1http://www.senseval.org.
pus only provides a handful of tagged examples. In
fact, only a few systems could overcome the Most
Frequent Sense (MFS) baseline, which would tag
each word with the sense occurring most frequently
in Semcor. In our approach, we will also rely on
Semcor as the basic resource, both for training ex-
amples and as an indicator of the distribution of the
senses of the target word.
The goal of our experiment is to evaluate up to
which point we can automatically acquire examples
for word senses and train accurate supervised WSD
systems on them. This is a very promising line of
research, but one which remains relatively under-
studied (cf. Section 2). The method we applied
is based on the monosemous relatives of the target
words (Leacock et al, 1998), and we studied some
parameters that affect the quality of the acquired
corpus, such as the distribution of the number of
training instances per each word sense (bias), and
the type of features used for disambiguation (local
vs. topical).
Basically, we built three systems, one fully su-
pervised (using examples from both Semcor and au-
tomatically acquired examples), one minimally su-
pervised (using the distribution of senses in Semcor
and automatically acquired examples) and another
fully unsupervised (using an automatically acquired
sense rank (McCarthy et al, 2004) and automati-
cally acquired examples).
This paper is structured as follows. First, Section
2 describes previous work on the field. Section 3 in-
troduces the experimental setting for evaluating the
acquired corpus. Section 4 is devoted to the process
of building the corpus, which is evaluated in Section
5. Finally, the conclusions are given in Section 6.
2 Previous work
As we have already mentioned, there is little work
on this very promising area. In (Leacock et al,
1998), the method to obtain sense-tagged examples
using monosemous relatives is presented. In this
work, they retrieve the same number of examples
per each sense, and they give preference to monose-
mous relatives that consist in a multiword contain-
ing the target word. Their experiment is evaluated
on 3 words (a noun, a verb, and an adjective) with
coarse sense-granularity and few senses. The results
showed that the monosemous corpus provided pre-
cision comparable to hand-tagged data.
In another related work, (Mihalcea, 2002) gener-
ated a sense tagged corpus (GenCor) by using a set
of seeds consisting of sense-tagged examples from
four sources: SemCor, WordNet, examples created
using the method above, and hand-tagged examples
from other sources (e.g., the Senseval-2 corpus). By
means of an iterative process, the system obtained
new seeds from the retrieved examples. An exper-
iment in the lexical-sample task showed that the
method was useful for a subset of the Senseval-2
testing words (results for 5 words are provided).
3 Experimental Setting for Evaluation
In this section we will present the Decision List
method, the features used to represent the context,
the two hand-tagged corpora used in the experiment
and the word-set used for evaluation.
3.1 Decision Lists
The learning method used to measure the quality of
the corpus is Decision Lists (DL). This algorithm is
described in (Yarowsky, 1994). In this method, the
sense s
k
with the highest weighted feature f
i
is se-
lected, according to its log-likelihood (see Formula
1). For our implementation, we applied a simple
smoothing method: the cases where the denomina-
tor is zero are smoothed by the constant 0.1 .
weight(s

, f
i
) = log(
Pr(s
k
|f
i
)
?
j =k
Pr(s
j
|f
i
)
) (1)
3.2 Features
In order to represent the context, we used a basic set
of features frequently used in the literature for WSD
tasks (Agirre and Martinez, 2000). We distinguish
two types of features:
 Local features: Bigrams and trigrams, formed
by the word-form, lemma, and part-of-speech2
of the surrounding words. Also the content
lemmas in a ?4 word window around the tar-
get.
 Topical features: All the content lemmas in the
context.
2The PoS tagging was performed using TnT (Brants, 2000)
We have analyzed the results using local and top-
ical features separately, and also using both types
together (combination).
3.3 Hand-tagged corpora
Semcor was used as training data for our supervised
system. This corpus offers tagged examples for
many words, and has been widely used for WSD.
It was necessary to use an automatic mapping be-
tween the WordNet 1.6 senses in Semcor and the
WordNet 1.7 senses in testing (Daude et al, 2000).
For evaluation, the test part of the Senseval-2 En-
glish lexical-sample task was chosen. The advan-
tage of this corpus was that we could focus on a
word-set with enough examples for testing. Be-
sides, it is a different corpus, so the evaluation is
more realistic than that made using cross-validation.
The test examples whose senses were multiwords
or phrasal verbs were removed, because they can be
efficiently detected with other methods in a prepro-
cess.
It is important to note that the training part of
Senseval-2 lexical-sample was not used in the con-
struction of the systems, as our goal was to test
the performance we could achieve with minimal re-
sources (i.e. those available for any word). We only
relied on the Senseval-2 training bias in preliminary
experiments on local/topical features (cf. Table 4),
and to serve as a reference for unsupervised perfor-
mance (cf. Table 5).
3.4 Word-set
The experiments were performed on the 29 nouns
available for the Senseval-2 lexical-sample task. We
separated these nouns in 2 sets, depending on the
number of examples they have in Semcor: Set A
contained the 16 nouns with more than 10 examples
in Semcor, and Set B the remaining low-frequency
words.
4 Building the monosemous relatives web
corpus
In order to build this corpus3, we have acquired
1000 Google snippets for each monosemous word
in WordNet 1.7. Then, for each word sense of the
ambiguous words, we gathered the examples of its
monosemous relatives (see below). This method is
inspired in (Leacock et al, 1998), and has shown to
be effective in experiments of topic signature acqui-
sition (Agirre and Lopez, 2004). This last paper also
shows that it is possible to gather examples based on
3The automatically acquired corpus will be referred indis-
tinctly as web-corpus, or monosemous-corpus
monosemous relatives for nearly all noun senses in
WordNet4.
The basic assumption is that for a given word
sense of the target word, if we had a monosemous
synonym of the word sense, then the examples of
the synonym should be very similar to the target
word sense, and could therefore be used to train a
classifier of the target word sense. The same, but
in a lesser extent, can be applied to other monose-
mous relatives, such as direct hyponyms, direct hy-
pernyms, siblings, indirect hyponyms, etc. The ex-
pected reliability decreases with the distance in the
hierarchy from the monosemous relative to the tar-
get word sense.
The monosemous-corpus was built using the sim-
plest technique: we collected examples from the
web for each of the monosemous relatives. The rel-
atives have an associated number (type), which cor-
relates roughly with the distance to the target word,
and indicates their relevance: the higher the type,
the less reliable the relative. A sample of monose-
mous relatives for different senses of church, to-
gether with its sense inventory in WordNet 1.7 is
shown in Figure 1.
Distant hyponyms receive a type number equal
to the distance to the target sense. Note that we
assigned a higher type value to direct hypernyms
than to direct hyponyms, as the latter are more use-
ful for disambiguation. We also decided to include
siblings, but with a high type value (3).
In the following subsections we will describe step
by step the method to construct the corpus. First we
will explain the acquisition of the highest possible
amount of examples per sense; then we will explain
different ways to limit the number of examples per
sense for a better performance; finally we will see
the effect of training on local or topical features on
this kind of corpora.
4.1 Collecting the examples
The examples are collected following these steps
1: We query Google5 with the monosemous rel-
atives for each sense, and we extract the snippets as
returned by the search engine. All snippets returned
by Google are used (up to 1000). The list of snippets
is sorted in reverse order. This is done because the
top hits usually are titles and incomplete sentences
that are not so useful.
2: We extract the sentences (or fragments of sen-
tences) around the target search term. Some of the

sentences are discarded, according to the following
criteria: length shorter than 6 words, having more
non-alphanumeric characters than words divided by
two, or having more words in uppercase than in low-
ercase.
3: The automatically acquired examples contain
a monosemous relative of the target word. In or-
der to use these examples to train the classifiers,
the monosemous relative (which can be a multi-
word term) is substituted by the target word. In
the case of the monosemous relative being a mul-
tiword that contains the target word (e.g. Protestant
Church for church) we can choose not to substitute,
because Protestant, for instance, can be a useful fea-
ture for the first sense of church. In these cases, we
decided not to substitute and keep the original sen-
tence, as our preliminary experiments on this corpus
suggested (although the differences were not signif-
icant).
4: For a given word sense, we collect the desired
number of examples (see following section) in or-
der of type: we first retrieve all examples of type
0, then type 1, etc. up to type 3 until the necessary
examples are obtained. We did not collect exam-
ples from type 4 upwards. We did not make any
distinctions between the relatives from each type.
(Leacock et al, 1998) give preference to multiword
relatives containing the target word, which could be
an improvement in future work.
On average, we have acquired roughly 24,000 ex-
amples for each of the target words used in this ex-
periment.
4.2 Number of examples per sense (bias)
Previous work (Agirre and Martinez, 2000) has re-
ported that the distribution of the number of exam-
ples per word sense (bias for short) has a strong
influence in the quality of the results. That is, the
results degrade significantly whenever the training
and testing samples have different distributions of
the senses.
As we are extracting examples automatically, we
have to decide how many examples we will use for
Sense 1
church, Christian church, Christianity -- (a group of Christians; any group professing
Christian doctrine or belief)
Sense 2
church, church building -- (a place for public (especially Christian) worship)
Sense 3
church service, church -- (a service conducted in a church)
Monosemous relatives for different senses of church
Synonyms (Type 0): church building (sense 2), church service (sense 3) ...
Direct hyponyms (Type 1): Protestant Church (sense 1), Coptic Church (sense 1) ...
Direct hypernyms (Type 2): house of prayer (sense 2), religious service (sense 3) ...
Distant hyponyms (Type 2,3,4...): Greek Church (sense 1), Western Church (sense 1)...
Siblings (Type 3): Hebraism (sense 2), synagogue (sense 2) ...

each sense. In order to test the impact of bias, dif-
ferent settings have been tried:
 No bias: we take an equal amount of examples
for each sense.
 Web bias: we take all examples gathered from
the web.
 Automatic ranking: the number of examples
is given by a ranking obtained following the
method described in (McCarthy et al, 2004).
They used a thesaurus automatically created
from the BNC corpus with the method from
(Lin, 1998), coupled with WordNet-based sim-
ilarity measures.
 Semcor bias: we take a number of examples
proportional to the bias of the word senses in
Semcor.
For example, Table 1 shows the number of exam-
ples per type (0,1,...) that are acquired for church
following the Semcor bias. The last column gives
the number of examples in Semcor.
We have to note that the 3 first methods do not
require any hand-labeled data, and that the fourth
relies in Semcor.
The way to apply the bias is not straightforward
in some cases. In our first approach for Semcor-
bias, we assigned 1,000 examples to the major sense
in Semcor, and gave the other senses their propor-
tion of examples (when available). But in some
cases the distribution of the Semcor bias and that
of the actual examples in the web would not fit. The
problem is caused when there are not enough exam-
ples in the web to fill the expectations of a certain
word sense.
We therefore tried another distribution. We com-
puted, for each word, the minimum ratio of exam-
ples that were available for a given target bias and a
given number of examples extracted from the web.
We observed that this last approach would reflect
better the original bias, at the cost of having less ex-
amples.
Table 2 presents the different distributions of
examples for authority. There we can see the
Senseval-testing and Semcor distributions, together
with the total number of examples in the web; the
Semcor proportional distribution (Pr) and minimum
ratio (MR); and the automatic distribution. The

the senses is different from that in Semcor, e.g. the
first sense only gets 33.7% of the examples, in con-
trast to the 60% it had in Semcor.
We can also see how the distributions of senses
in Semcor and Senseval-test have important differ-
ences, although the main sense is the same. For the
web and automatic distributions, the first sense is
different; and in the case of the web distribution, the
first hand-tagged sense only accounts for 0.5% of
the examples retrieved from the web. Similar distri-
bution discrepancies can be observed for most of the
words in the test set. The Semcor MR column shows
how using minimum ratio we get a better reflection
of the proportion of examples in Semcor, compared
to the simpler proportional approach (Semcor Pr) .
For the automatic bias we only used the minimum
ratio.
To conclude this section, Table 3 shows the num-
ber of examples acquired automatically following
the web bias, the Semcor bias with minimum ratio,
and the Automatic bias with minimum ratio.
4.3 Local vs. topical features
Previous work on automatic acquisition of examples
(Leacock et al, 1998) has reported lower perfor-
mance when using local collocations formed by PoS
tags or closed-class words. We performed an early
experiment comparing the results using local fea-
tures, topical features, and a combination of both.
In this case we used the web corpus with Senseval
training bias, distributed according to the MR ap-
proach, and always substituting the target word. The
recall (per word and overall) is given in Table 4.
In this setting, we observed that local collocations
achieved the best precision overall, but the combina-
tion of all features obtained the best recall. The table
does not show the precision/coverage figures due to
space constraints, but local features achieve 58.5%
precision for 96.7% coverage overall, while topical
and combination of features have full-coverage.
There were clear differences in the results per
word, showing that estimating the best feature-set
per word would improve the performance. For the
corpus-evaluation experiments, we chose to work
with the combination of all features.
5 Evaluation
In all experiments, the recall of the systems is pre-
sented as evaluation measure. There is total cover-
age (because of the high overlap of topical features)
and the recall and precision are the same6.
In order to evaluate the acquired corpus, our first
task was to analyze the impact of bias. The results
are shown in Table 5. There are 2 figures for each
distribution: (1) simply assign the first ranked sense,
and (2) use the monosemous corpus following the
predetermined bias. As we described in Section 3,
the testing part of the Senseval-2 lexical sample data
was used for evaluation. We also include the results
using Senseval2 bias, which is taken from the train-
ing part. The recall per word for some distributions
can be seen in Table 4.
The results show clearly that when bias informa-
tion from a hand-tagged corpora is used the recall
improves significantly, even when the bias comes
from a corpus -Semcor- different from the target
corpus -Senseval-. The bias is useful by itself, and
we see that the higher the performance of the 1st
ranked sense heuristic, the lower the gain using the
monosemous corpus. We want to note that in fully
unsupervised mode we attain a recall of 43.2% with
the automatic ranking. Using the minimally su-
pervised information of bias, we get 49.8% if we
have the bias from an external corpus (Semcor) and

features the coverage is only partial.

57.5% if we have access to the bias of the target
corpus (Senseval7). This results show clearly that
the acquired corpus has useful information about the
word senses, and that bias is extremely important.
We will present two further experiments per-
formed with the monosemous corpus resource. The
goal of the first will be to measure the WSD per-
formance that we achieve using Semcor as the only
supervised data source. In our second experiment,
we will compare the performance of our totally un-
supervised approach (monosemous corpus and au-
tomatic bias) with other unsupervised approaches in
the Senseval-2 English lexical task.
5.1 Monosemous corpus and Semcor bias
In this experiment we compared the performance
using the monosemous corpus (with Semcor bias
and minimum ratio), and the examples from Sem-
cor. We noted that there were clear differences
depending on the number of training examples for
7Bias obtained from the training-set.
each word, therefore we studied each word-set de-
scribed in Section 3.4 separately. The results per
word-set are shown in Table 6. The figures cor-
respond to the recall training in Semcor, the web-
corpus, and the combination of both.
If we focus on set B (words with less than 10 ex-
amples in Semcor), we see that the MFS figure is
very low (40.1%). There are some words that do not
have any occurrence in Semcor, and thus the sense
is chosen at random. It made no sense to train the
DL for this set, therefore this result is not in the ta-
ble. For this set, the bias information from Semcor
is also scarce, but the DLs trained on the web-corpus
raise the performance to 47.8%.
For set A, the average number of examples is
higher, and this raises the results for Semcor MFS
(51.9%). We see that the recall for DL training
in Semcor is lower that the MFS baseline (50.5%).
The main reasons for these low results are the dif-
ferences between the training and testing corpora
(Semcor and Senseval). There have been previous
works on portability of hand-tagged corpora that
show how some constraints, like the genre or topic
of the corpus, affect heavily the results (Martinez
and Agirre, 2000). If we train on the web-corpus
the results improve, and the best results are ob-
tained with the combination of both corpora, reach-
ing 51.6%. We need to note, however, that this is
still lower than the Semcor MFS.
Finally, we will examine the results for the whole
set of nouns in the Senseval-2 lexical-sample (last
row in Table 6), where we see that the best approach
relies on the web-corpus. In order to disambiguate
the 29 nouns using only Semcor, we apply MFS
when there are less than 10 examples (set B), and
train the DLs for the rest.
The results in Table 6 show that the web-corpus
raises recall, and the best results are obtained com-
bining the Semcor data and the web examples
(50.3%). As we noted, the web-corpus is specially
useful when there are few examples in Semcor (set
B), therefore we made another test, using the web-
corpus only for set B, and applying MFS for set A.
The recall was slightly better (50.5%), as is shown
in the last column.
5.2 Monosemous corpus and Automatic bias
(unsupervised method)
In this experiment we compared the performance
of our unsupervised system with other approaches.
For this goal, we used the resources available from
the Senseval-2 competition8, where the answers of
the participating systems in the different tasks were

available. This made possible to compare our re-
sults and those of other systems deemed unsuper-
vised by the organizers on the same test data and set
of nouns.
From the 5 unsupervised systems presented in
the Senseval-2 lexical-sample task as unsupervised,
the WASP-Bench system relied on lexicographers
to hand-code information semi-automatically (Tug-
well and Kilgarriff, 2001). This system does not
use the training data, but as it uses manually coded
knowledge we think it falls clearly in the supervised
category.
The results for the other 4 systems and our own
are shown in Table 7. We show the results for the
totally unsupervised system and the minimally un-
supervised system (Semcor bias). We classified the
UNED system (Fernandez-Amoros et al, 2001) as
minimally supervised. It does not use hand-tagged
examples for training, but some of the heuristics that
are applied by the system rely on the bias informa-
tion available in Semcor. The distribution of senses
is used to discard low-frequency senses, and also to
choose the first sense as a back-off strategy. On the
same conditions, our minimally supervised system
attains 49.8 recall, nearly 5 points more.
The rest of the systems are fully unsupervised,
and they perform significantly worse than our sys-
tem.

promising line of research, but remains relatively
under-studied. We have applied the ?monosemous
relatives? method to construct automatically a web
corpus which we have used to train three systems
based on Decision Lists: one fully supervised (ap-
plying examples from Semcor and the web corpus),
one minimally supervised (relying on the distribu-
tion of senses in Semcor and the web corpus) and
another fully unsupervised (using an automatically
acquired sense rank and the web corpus). Those
systems were tested on the Senseval-2 lexical sam-
ple test set.
We have shown that the fully supervised system
combining our web corpus with the examples in
Semcor improves over the same system trained on
Semcor alone. This improvement is specially no-
ticeable in the nouns that have less than 10 examples
in Semcor. Regarding the minimally supervised
and fully unsupervised systems, we have shown
that they perform well better than the other systems
of the same category presented in the Senseval-2
lexical-sample competition.
The system can be trained for all nouns
in WordNet, using the data available at
http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/pub/sensecorpus.
The research also highlights the importance of
bias. Knowing how many examples are to be fed
into the machine learning system is a key issue. We
have explored several possibilities, and shown that
the learning system (DL) is able to learn from the
web corpus in all the cases, beating the respective
heuristic for sense distribution.
We think that this research opens the opportu-
nity for further improvements. We have to note that
the MFS heuristic and the supervised systems based
on the Senseval-2 training data are well ahead of
our results, and our research aims at investigating
ideas to close this gap. Some experiments on the
line of adding automatically retrieved examples to
available hand-tagged data (Semcor and Senseval-
2) have been explored. The preliminary results indi-
cate that this process has to be performed carefully,
taking into account the bias of the senses and apply-
ing a quality-check of the examples before they are
included in the training data.
For the future we also want to test the perfor-
mance of more powerful Machine Learning meth-
ods, explore feature selection methods for each in-
dividual word, and more sophisticated ways to com-
bine the examples from the web corpus with those
of Semcor or Senseval. Now that the monosemous
corpus is available for all nouns, we would also like
to test the system on the all-words task. In addition,
we will give preference to multiwords that contain
the target word when choosing the relatives. Finally,
more sophisticated methods to acquire examples are
now available, like ExRetriever (Fernandez et al,
2004), and they could open the way to better exam-
ples and performance.
