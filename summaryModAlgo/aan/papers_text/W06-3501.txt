Pragmatic information extraction from subject ellipsis in informal English  Shigeko Nariyama Asia Institute University of Melbourne Melbourne Australia shigeko@unimelb.edu.au     Abstract Subject ellipsis is one of the characteris-tics of informal English. The investigation of subject ellipsis in corpora thus reveals an abundance of pragmatic and extra-linguistic information associated with subject ellipsis that enhances natural lan-guage understanding. In essence, the presence of subject ellipsis conveys an ?informal? conversation involving 1) an informal ?Topic? as well as familiar/close ?Participants?, 2) specific ?Connotations? that are different from the corresponding full sentences: interruptive (ending dis-course coherence), polite, intimate, friendly, and less determinate implica-tures. This paper also construes linguistic environments that trigger the use of sub-ject ellipsis and resolve subject ellipsis. 1 Introduction The interpretation of pragmatic information, such as intention, implicature1, underspecified reference, as well as extra-linguistic information, is a prohibi-tively difficult task in natural language understand-ing (NLU) at present. This paper demonstrates that this kind of information can be extracted from a small linguistic phenomenon; that is, subject ellip-sis observed in informal English.                                                             1  An implicature can be defined as anything that is inferred from an utterance but that is not a condition for the truth of the utterance (Levinson 1983:127). 
Ellipsis has a part in the study of anaphora, as it is often referred to as ?zero anaphora?. Anaphora resolution in English (pronominal resolution in particular, and to lesser extent bridging anaphora) has been a challenging topic for some decades both in NLU and linguistics. In contrast, the study of ellipsis in English centers around VP ellipsis and little discussion has been made on subject of nomi-nal ellipsis (naturally because of its infrequent oc-currence in formal written texts), and much less still on pragmatic effects generated from subject ellipsis. The study in NLU has approached the top-ics (VP ellipsis and pronominal anaphors) with the interest of resolving its referent and coreferencing, while linguistics has more concerned with the or-ganization of discourse coherence. The goal of this paper is to amalgamate both approaches and interests, and more importantly, to draw implicatures that are generated by subject ellipsis, by delineating various types of pragmatic information associated with subject ellipsis. First, it refutes some of the commonly held misconcep-tions regarding subject ellipsis (Section 2). Section 3 examines the linguistic environments (types of texts, elided subjects and predicates) that trigger subject ellipsis. It also accounts for resolving the referent of subject ellipsis, as this can cause a prob-lem in English for not having extensive subject-verb agreement. Section 4 construes the type of implicatures that subject ellipsis gives rise to. Sec-tion 5 suggests a preliminary procedure. 2 Misconceptions about subject ellipsis Ellipsis, and anaphora more generally, are said to play a major part in the organisation of conversa-tion and narrative for reasons of economy, dis-
1
course coherence, and style (e.g. Halliday and Has-san, 1976). However, subject ellipsis seems to op-erate rather differently from anaphor and general ellipsis. The findings of this paper dispute or com-plement ?economy? and ?discourse coherence? as reasons for its use, in particular, the following commonly believed characteristics on subject el-lipsis. They are that subject ellipsis is used for:  1) Economy, for speaking fast  2) Coherence 3) Conversation (i.e. spoken dialogue) 4) Spontaneous (unplanned) speech 5) First person pronoun elided in a declarative and second person in an interrogative   1) Regarding economy, subject ellipsis happens for more than simple reasons of economy. In fact, it is suspected that the speakers of English con-sciously resort to subject ellipsis when they wish to economize their utterance. If the view of economy is maintained, all subject ellipses would be spoken fast and be observed in every hasty utterance, which is not the case in the corpora. Some subject-less sentences, such as ?(It?s) been a long time? is often spoken slowly with underling emotions. Rather, subject ellipsis seems to be employed more for conveying different implicatures (see ?4) that underlie them, that are different from the corre-sponding full sentences with overt subject.  2) Regarding discourse coherence, one of the implicatures given rise to by the use of subject el-lipsis is ?interruptive? and hence it connotes the speaker?s intention to end the current topic or con-versation itself (see ?4.1), by which in effect dis-course coherence is discontinued. 3) The perception that subject ellipsis is found in conversation is inaccurate, as it is also found in many informal written texts, such as diaries, post-cards, emails, logs and blogs on the internet. 4) Subject ellipsis is believed to be a result of informal spontaneous utterances without planning and editing, but in fact it is not limited to this type. For example, the automated teller machine of a bank in New Zealand gives out this message at the end of inputting instructions, ?OK. Got that.? This is by no means an unplanned message; in fact it is a prudently planned message for a particular impli-cature, i.e. to make the response sound friendly. 5) The last misconception, which relates to el-lipsis resolution, is that subject ellipsis in English 
operates on the principle that first person pronoun is elided in a declarative and second person in an interrogative with a rising interrogative intonation, as in "(I) got in late." versus "(You) got in late?" This certainly plays a part in the mechanism of subject ellipsis, and is probably true across lan-guages. However, the corpus analyses found that while first person subject ellipsis is prominent, second person subject ellipsis is rare (see ?3.2) 3 Linguistic conditions for subject ellipsis A missing subject in English 2  is syntactically prominent and hence is relatively easy to mechani-cally detect. However, for speech data it poses an issue. Some subject ellipses can be marginal be-tween ellipsis and phonetic erosion (e.g. inaudible subject word being spoken sotto voce and quickly), and an appropriate heuristically oriented threshold based on instrumental analysis (e.g. the use of spectrography) must be set up as a criterion for determining ellipsis, although across-the-board ?acoustic correlates? of the subject ellipsis may remain as an equivocal issue. For simplicity and reasons that the main theme of this paper is not the determination of ellipsis itself, this paper considers the transcriptions of spoken texts. Moreover, not-withstanding that the role of prosodic features plays a significant part in determining implicatures, given the scope of this paper, it is basically put aside for future study. Nonetheless, the findings are still meaningful for analyzing informal utter-ances in the internet domains, such as emails, logs and blogs, the type of text that is increasing expo-nentially in quantity and importance in NLU par-ticularly for being able to process mechanically. It is conceded that the description of subject el-lipsis in this paper is drawn from small corpora in NLU standards, although covering various types of texts and studies in the literature, so that the find-ings from this analysis are intended to provide a starting point in the study of the pragmatic infor-mation that subject ellipsis prevails.                                                             2  Subject ellipsis refers to those unexpressed subjects occur-ring in the sentence initial position, hence excluding subject ellipsis in coordinate structures and non-finite clauses (adver-bial clauses, gerundive clauses, and prepositional clauses). This is drawn from the claim that non-syntactically motivated subject ellipsis only occurs in the sentence initial position (McShane 2005, Nariyama 2004, Swales 2002, Cote 1996), except that Haegeman and Ihsane (1999) claim that a diary may exhibit some use of subject ellipsis in embedded clauses.

3.1 Type of texts Undoubtedly subject ellipsis is a feature of infor-mal register. We would not expect to hear subject-less sentences, for example, at court hearings. Indeed, Swales (2002) examined a corpus of aca-demic speech (MICASE), consisting of 36 speech-events, covering such texts as colloquia, disserta-tion defenses and lab meetings. He reports that subject ellipsis is rare in formal speech; the highest ratio was found for DEPENDS at 14%, followed by LOOKS at 8.1%.  Swales also notes the dialectal aspect that sub-ject ellipsis is a more prominent feature for British English (also by Cote 1996); the rate of subject ellipsis before DEPENDS is 60% in British Eng-lish conversation and 30% in American English. Comparing these with 14% in MICASE, subject ellipsis is indeed a character of informal speech.  Further evidence is found in Taylor (2002) in analysing Australian English Corpus (Monash University 1996~1998) that Gotta often occurred without an overt subject, all with first person sub-jects. The contracted forms of lexicon, such gonna, gotta and hafta (so called ?the quasi-modals?), are undoubtedly representative of casual speech.3 However, what may not be so obvious is that an informal register does not license the use of subject ellipsis at all times. The corpus analysis on TV drama scripts (?3.2) found that subject ellipsis had a propensity to emerge at particular scenes and topics where the atmosphere of the scenes is both casual and friendly, while it did not occur with the same speech participants at other scenes and topics. This is plausible from the fact that when asking a favour or showing gratitude, more formal language (i.e. without ellipsis) tends to be used even to close participants. Or colleagues may frequently say ?Dunno? and ?Doesn?t matter? to each other. However, in a situation where one lost his job, he is unlikely to use subjectless sentences in response to a question ?What happened??  3.2 Type of elided referents Table 1 shows the results of the referent distribu-tion of subject ellipsis from analyzing three cor-                                                           3 The use of subject ellipsis in non-informal texts is also found (Cote 1996). Recipe and instruction texts constantly elide subject (as well as object). This usage is domain specific and the referent is fixed as a second person subject.

This is attributed to the fact that the data were drawn from conversations with particular topics rather than a free conversation. Hence many utterances relate to the past mentions of descriptions where the anaphoric use of ?it/he/she? is more relevant (see Table 2 ?3.4.1 for the ratio). Nonetheless, what is common among the three is that 1) first person pronoun ellipsis is fre-quent, 2) second person ellipsis is rare, although the corpora are a collection of dialogues (?3.3).  3.3 Informativeness  Semantic informativeness of a sentence plays a major part in enabling subject ellipsis. It is mani-fested in two ways: type of verbs & adjectives and the amount of information expressed in a sentence.  3.3.1 Type of verbs and adjectives Subject ellipsis has a strong association with, and hence is triggered by, particular verbs and adjec-tives (with or without auxiliary). Swales (2002) found the following verbs to be of such types in MICASE (academic speech corpus): DEPENDS, SEEMS, SOUNDS, LOOKS, TURNS OUT, WANNA, HEARD, SEEN, and GOT.  This does not, however, explain the frequency of first person subject ellipsis and rareness of second person subject ellipsis seen in Table 1. Nariyama 
3
(2004) claims that it is fundamentally an epistemic reasoning (having sufficient knowledge about a statement) that has substantial controls on the appllication of subject ellipsis. The most of the verbs above that come with subject ellipsis require epistemic knowledge and hence first person subject ellipsis. Even when the subject is ?it?, the agent (psychological subject) is still first person.  Because of epistemic reasoning, semantically rich and private verbal lexicon can only be used for first person subject, as in the (a) examples, and this makes second person subjectless sentences unac-ceptable even in an interrogative, as in the (b)s.  (1a)   (I?d) love a coffee.   (1b)  * (Would you) love a coffee? (2a)   (I?m) feeling fantastic.  (2b)  (*) (Are you) feeling fantastic? (3a)   (I) wouldn?t mind a coffee.  (3b) (*)(You) wouldn?t mind a coffee?  ?Love? conveys high degree of preference as well as a request, which is privy and subjective to the speaker. Thus, the speaker can state his own feel-ing, as well as make a request, but cannot do so for others;4 hence (1b) is unacceptable; analogously for (2b) and (3b), or ?hate?, ?thought?, and ?hope?. This unacceptability of sentences with second per-son subject often remains even with overt subjects. 3.3.2 Amount of information Analogous to the richness and privy of lexicon, informativeness in terms of amount of information (number of phrases) governs the acceptability of subject ellipsis. It is less restricted for sentences with first person subject as in the (a) examples than non-first person subject as in the (b)s.   (4a)    (I) had a good time. (4b)   (Did you) have a good time? (5a)  (I) had a wonderful time.   (5b) (?) (Did you) have a wonderful time? (6a) (I) had a good time visiting my family in Syd-ney last week. (6b) (*) (Did you) have a good time visiting your family in Sydney last week?                                                             4 Japanese is well documented for having rigid constraints on subjective statements (Nariyama 2003, Aoki 1986, inter alia). 
3.4 Referent resolution The recoverability of referent is the imperative condition on the employment of ellipsis, but Eng-lish has limited subject-verb agreement. So, how is the referent of elided subject retrieved? 3.4.1 Locational constraint The results in Table 1 are further examined by the type of subject ellipsis, and are summarized as fol-lows (mostly drawn on the TV corpus):  1) Anaphoric (23/53) 2) Deictic (21/53) 3) Idiomatic (conventionalised usage) (8/53) 4)   Expletive ?it? (1/17, c.f. FaCon:2/30)  The corpus analysis concludes that 2) Deictic, 3) Idiomatic (?3.4.2) and 4) Expletive subject ellipses can occur freely, but 1) Anaphoric has a locational restriction to occur immediately after the sentence with the referent, for example:  A: Where?s dad? B: [TV33]  (He?s) birthday shopping, I bet.     [TV34]  (He?s) so bad at pretending.  Where the referent is not found in the immedi-ately proceeding sentence, quasi-right dislocation was used to express the subject at the end of the sentence, presumably to ensure that no ambiguity of reference would occur, for instance:   Quasi-right dislocation  A:  He?s going to do a Thorpey after today. B:  Why?  What happened? A: [TV24] Won the year 7 freestyle, he did.  Although the use of ?it? was frequent in Table 1, the expletive use was rare (See Lappin and Leass (1994) for identifying the expletive use of ?it?.) As mentioned, this is attributed to the type of corpora having specific topics of conversation.

3.4.2 Complementary distribution The constraints on informativeness described in ?3.3 often produce complementary distribution with regard to the type referent for subject ellipsis, and hence they in turn signal the referent of ellipsis. For example, ?love? is associated with first person subject (7a) and ?like? with second (8a):  (7a)  (I?d) love a coffee. (7b)  *(I?d) like a coffee. (8a)  (Would you) like a coffee? (8b)  *(Would you) love a coffee? Likewise, idiomatic subjectless expressions are essentially set phrases whose meanings are self-contained in their own right, so that elements in the expressions tend to be fixed in terms of person, the declarative/interrogative, polarity, and verbs. Hence, these constraints resolves the referent of subject ellipsis. For example, ?gonna be long? is strongly associated with second person subject and therefore occurs in interrogatives as in (9a). It sounds odd to be used for first person subject even in a declarative (9b) or with the full sentence (9c). Instead (10a) is likely to be used for the proposi-tion, which in turn is awkward for a second person subject (10b). Thus, it creates complementary distribution.    (9a)     (Are you) gonna be long? (9b)   *(I?m) gonna to be long.  (9c)   ? I?m gonna to be long.  (10a)     (I?m) gonna be a while. (10b)  (*) (Are you) gonna be a while?  Analogously, ?won?t be a minute? is strongly associated with first person in declarative (11a), so that the same with second person (11b) is unac-ceptable unless it is quoting or parodying the ear-lier statement. The same goes for ?just be a minute? in (12a) and (12b).   (11a)    (I) won?t be a minute.   (11b)  * (You) won?t be a minute? (12a)    (I?ll) just be a minute.   (12b)  * (You will) just be a minute?    Polarity is also often fixed for a particular ex-pression. For example, (13a) is set for first person 
subject and negative, so that any variation to it gives rise to an unacceptable sentence; e.g. second person negative interrogative (13b) (unless quoting or parodying what the person has just said), first person non-negative declarative (13c), and second person non-negative interrogative (13d) are all un-acceptable. Interestingly, (13d) will be acceptable if it is expressed slightly differently with an overt subject, as in ?Do you mind having a coffee (be-cause I haven?t got anything else at the moment)??   (13a)     (I) wouldn?t mind a coffee.  (13b)  * (You) wouldn?t mind a coffee? (13c)  * (I) mind a coffee.   (13d)  * (You) mind a coffee?  Thus, the constraints on person, declara-tive/interrogative form, polarity, and verbal seman-tics in turn allow little ambiguity in recovering the referent of subject ellipsis. 3.4.3 Discerning subject ellipsis from impera-tives Subject ellipsis in the initial position is structurally identical with the imperative construction in Eng-lish. However, potential ambiguities in the inter-pretation are resolved by a number of factors. First, the semantic content of privy verbs cannot be forced upon someone else, and hence does not make sense for such subjectless sentences to be interpreted as imperatives, for instance:   (14) * Like a coffee!      c.f.  (14a)  Have a coffee! (15) * Feel alright!  The second is the tense complementarity. Some verbs tend to occur in a past tense, e.g. ?got?, while imperatives do not allow past tense:   (16a)   * Got a house!   (16b)  Get a house!  The third is that the presence and type of the object can make the distinction; e.g, ?Tell you? will be interpreted as a subjectless sentence ?(I?ll) tell you?, while ?Tell me? will be interpreted as an imperative ?(You) tell me?. Analogously, ?See you later? is interpreted as a subjectless sentence ?(I?ll) see you later?, while ?See me later? as an impera-tive/request sentence ?(You) see me later.?

4 Five basic implicatures Undoubtedly intonation and context play a large part in the inferred meanings. Nonetheless, the iconicity in the implicatures is observed in the fol-lowing sets of examples. (a)s with subject ellipsis convey specific meanings without being linguisti-cally expressed in a strict sense, while (b)s convey unmarked linguistic meaning.  (17a)    (I?ve) gotta go.    (17b)   I?ve got to go.  (18a)    (I) dunno.    (18b)  I don?t know. (19a)    (I?ve) got it.    (19b)  I?ve got it. (20a)   (It) doesn?t matter.   (20b)  It doesn?t matter. (21a)    (I) should?ve known better.  (21b)  I should have known better. (22a)   (It?s) been a long time.  (22b)  It?s been a long time.   (17a): a more evasive and dismissive motive,  (17b): tends to imply a more honest/genuine state-ment that the speaker actually has to get to a par-ticular place by certain time.   (18a): an indeterminate state of mind such as ?I?m not sure?, ?I haven?t thought about it?, or a dismis-sive motive, such as ?I don?t want to think about it.?, or even to the extent, ?I don?t care?.  (18b): more genuine: ?I thought about it, but I have no idea.?   (19a): more emphatic and the speaker may have anticipated what the interlocutor has just said and therefore (19a) is a little hasty-sounding.  (20a): more likely about trivial matters  (20b): for more important, serious matters, and for giving consolation.    (21a): less directed/emphatic and therefore less punitive and apologetic that the mistake is under-standable, silly, or trivial.   (22a): has a restricted usage directed at someone intimate to the speaker.   Five basic implicatures can be drawn from the above and the earlier examples: 1) Interruptive with dismissive/evasive motives (e.g. all of the 
above except 22a), 2) Polite (e.g. 21a), 3) Intimate (e.g. 22a), 4) Friendly (e.g. 1a, 9a, 19a), and 5) Less determinate implicatures (e.g. 18a, ?Depends?, ?Seems?).  Subject seems to drop for two basic reasons. First, for 1), 4) and 5) implicatures, the meaning conveyed by subjectless utterances tends to be eva-sive, less determinate (informative, definite, for-mal), and spoken fast. It is a logical tendency for semantically insignificant elements to be un-stressed, and unstressed pronouns drop, which is economical in conversation. The other is that the subject is intentionally underspecified either for disguising the identity for 2), or for the effect that the absence of the subject makes the identity con-spicuous for 3).  4.1 Interruptive implicatures with dismis-sive/evasive motives Speech act participants generally have the intention to converse with one another and sustain their con-versation, as described in Grice?s hallmark discov-ery of the Cooperative principle (1975). While full sentences to some degree elicit responses from the addressees and therefore aid conversation flow, the corresponding subjectless sentences tend to convey to the addressee implicatures of fulfilling social obligation, keeping a low conversational profile, and minimising invitation of response to the sub-jectless utterance. For example, ?(I?ve) gotta go? tend to imply that the speaker is fulfilling his social obligation by acknowledging the presence of the addressee in making an utterance, but at the same time indicating that he is not inviting any meaning-ful response. Indeed, this example was used in the TV drama instead of saying ?Good-bye?.  If this view is maintained, subject ellipsis can have the effect of changing a topic or ending a conversation itself, in which case it has the oppo-site effect to what has been claimed on anaphora and ellipsis; anaphora is one means of establishing coherence (e.g. Fox 1996, Halliday and Hasan 1976). This claim is plausible that the use of ellip-sis does create cognitive states of coherence on the grounds that the addressee has to look elsewhere for the interpretation of the missing subject; and in doing so links the current sentence to another sen-tence. It is certainly true for anaphoric use of sub-jectless sentences, but for the above usages it is questionable. 
6
4.2 Polite implicatures  Some subjects seem deliberately unspecified in order to conceal the subject identity or make it am-biguous for politeness; for example. (Note that in (23) concord is also taken out.)   (23) (I/you/we/he/they/.. ?ve/s) got to have a coffee. (24) (I/you/we/he/they/?) should?ve known better. (25) (I/you/he/they/?) haven?t/hasn?t got a chance. (26) (I/you/we/he/they/?) should send a postcard.  The subject of (23) can be interpreted as anyone in the presence of a group of people, but the intended referent may in fact be ?I? because ?I?m tired?, ?you? because ?you look sleepy?, or ?we? because ?we all worked so hard?. This under-specified sub-ject avoids a direct speech act and one?s responsi-bility/accusation/self-centeredness (e.g. ?I got to have a coffee?), and softens the implicatures by creating an indirect request/suggestion. Even when the intended referent is clear, it is left up to the ad-dressees whether or not to interpret the elided sub-ject as being directed to himself. This indirectness is seen as one type of politeness strategy (Brown and Levinson 1987, Leech 1983). (27b) is an interesting example from the TV cor-pus for having the first person subject ellipsis in-stead of second in an interrogative ?(Would you) like another??, which may contribute to the rare-ness of second person subject. The same speaker uttered (27a) and (27b) with no pause in between.  (27a)  (It) looks cold.  [The speaker is looking at             the addressee?s cup of tea.] (27b)  (Shall I) make another (cuppa)?  While the semantic content of the sentences is vir-tually identical, some speakers of English find (27b) more polite than the one with the second per-son subject, because it offers help as well as asks the desire of the addressee. This view is consistent with the description by Leech (1983) that the more benefit an utterance brings to the hearer, the more polite it is. Interestingly, (27b) cannot be interpret-ed as ?(Would you) make another?? in the context. 4.3 Intimate implicatures Some subjectless sentences convey intimate impli-catures, when spoken slowly with specific prosody. 
(28)   (It?s) been a long time.  (29)   (It?s) nice to see you. (30)   (It?s) lovely to get your email. 4.4 Friendly implicatures Subjectless sentences with friendly implicatures relate to particular expressions, such as ?Had a good time? and ?Like a coffee?? Friendly and Intimate implicatures overlap somewhat, but they differ with the view that the subject in the former drops for being friendly and therefore causal, while in the latter the absence of the subject makes the obvious identity of the sub-ject conspicuous, more meaningful, and private.  4.5 Less determinate implicatures Owing to the semantics of the verbs, subjectless sentences with such verbs as DEPENDS, SEEMS, SOUNDS, LOOKS, TURNS OUT, HEARD, and SEEN tend to convey less determinate, definite, less objective implicatures. Arnold Zwicky makes similar notes (Language log March 19 2005), in that ?Odd that Mary never showed up? is more ex-pressive/subjective, while the corresponding full sentence ?It is odd that Mary never showed up? is more reportive/objective. 4.6 Discriminating the implicatures All things in pragmatics are extremely convoluted involving seemingly limitless factors that influence the ultimate interpretation, and worse still all interpretations are defeasible. Thus, the following is a rough description of features that discriminate the five implicatures at this stage.  Each implicature relates to particular expres-sions deriving from their lexical semantics, par-ticularly the polite and intimate implicatures. Some expressions such as ?Got it? can have multiple implicatures. The qualitative studies with prosodic features will reveal the type of expressions associ-ated with each implicature, for example, the fast spoken ?Got it? is to imply interruptive implicature.  Then the derived implicatures can in turn signal, for example, that the polite implicatures are associ-ated with multiple interpretations of the subject identity (in which case ellipsis resolution is less important for this type of ellipsis), or that the inti-mate implicatures reveal the speaker?s loving relationship with the addressee.

5 Resolution procedure  A preliminary rough procedure regarding subject ellipsis in English is briefly suggested here.  1. Detect a sentence-initial subject ellipsis. 1.1 Discard if it is an imperative based on ?3.4.3. 2.  Pragmatic information extraction Draw an implicature based on ?4.6 with consideration to the dialectal differences (?3.1). 3. Extra linguistic information extraction Sublectless sentsences imply ?informal? conver-sation involving an informal ?topic? and famil-iar/close ?participants?. 6 Conclusion This paper has made a wide description concerning subject ellipsis in English: the linguistic environ-ments that trigger subject ellipsis, including the subject ellipsis resolution, and the marked implica-tures conveyed by subject ellipsis that are different from those given by the corresponding full sen-tences with overt subject. It seems paradoxical that less words, i.e. more ellipses, convey more internal feelings and intentions. Subject ellipsis, and elliptical constructions more generally, are an essential feature of every-day conversation and are a common phenomenon cross-linguistically. Gilligan (1987) reported, based on a sample of 100 languages, that only seven of these do not allow subject ellipsis in finite clauses. Since English is not generally known for ellipsis, the study on other languages may reveal more interesting outcomes. Finally, the work on this topic is in its infancy and great more work ahead of us before the find-ings can be put to meaningful use in an NLU sys-tem. First, a quantitative investigation with prosodic features is a must for assuring the find-ings of this paper and creating an inventory of sub-ject ellipsis. Further investigation will point to the direction for the most appropriate applications and methods to implement this sort of pragmatic in-formation into a system. The use of findings may be more accurate and feasible for generation than for understanding. Nonetheless, it will be of use to applications that are in search of contextual cues to identifying the type of topic, participants and their relationship, and in rephrasing relatively formal sentences to more informal ones.
