Summary  
The a im of th is  communicat ion  is  to obta in  an exp l i c i t  fo rmula  fo r  ca lcu la t -  
ing the ent ropy  of a source  wh ich  behaves  in accordance  wi th  the ru les  of an 
arb i t ra ry  Phrase  S t ruc ture  Grammar ,  in wh ich  re la t ive  probab i l i t i es  a re  
a t tached  to the ru les  in the grammar .  With th is  a im in mind  we in t roduce  an 
a l te~rnat ive de f in i t ion  of the concept  of a PSG as a se t  of  se l f -embedded ( re -  
Curs ive)  F in i te  S ta te  Grammars ;  when the probab i l i t i es  a re  taken  into account  
in such  a grammar  we ca l l  i t  a Recurs ive  Markov  Process .

kov  P rocesses  we are  go ing to genera l i ze  la ter  on (in sec .  3), and we a l so  
out l ine  the concept  of ent ropy  in an ord inary  Markov  source .  More  deta i l s  "of 
in fo rmat ion  may be foupd~ e .g . ,  in Kh inch ins  "Mathemat ica l  Foundat ions  of 
In fo rmat ion  Theory" ,  N .Y .  ~ 1957~ or  " In fo rmat ion  Theory"  by  R.  Ash ,  N. Y. , 
1965. 
A Markov  Grammar  is  de f ined  as a Markov  Source  w i th  the fo l low ing  proper -  
t ie  s : 
Assume that  there  a re  n+ 1 s ta tes ,  say  S O , S1, . . . ,  Sn, in the source .  S O is  
de f ined  as  the in i t ia l  s ta te  and S is  de f ined  as  the f ina l  s ta te  and the o ther  
n 
s ta tes  a re  ca l led  in termed ia te  s ta tes .  We sha l l ,  of course ,  a l so  have  a t rans i -  
t ion mat r ix ,  M = (Pi j) ,  conta in ing  the, t rans i t ion  probab i l i t i es  of  the source .  
a) A t rans i t ion  f rom s ta te  S i to s ta te  S k is  a lways  accompan ied  by a produc-  
t ion  of a (non-zero)  le t te r  a ik  f rom a g iven  f in i te  a lphabet .  T rans i t ion  to 
d i f fe rent  s ta tes  f rom one g iven  s ta te  a lway  s p roduce  d i f fe rent  le t te rs .  
b) F rom the" in i t ia l  s ta te ,  S0~ d i rec t  or  ind i rec t  t rans i t ions  shou ld  be poss ib le  
to any o ther  s ta te  in the source .  F rom no s ta te  is  a t rans i t ion  to S O a l lowed.  
c) F rom any s ta te ,  d i rec t  or  ind i rec t  t rans i t ions  to the f ina l  s ta te  S shou ld  
n 
be poss ib le .  F rom S n no t rans i t ion  is  a l lowed to any o ther  s ta te  (S n is  an 
"absorb ing  s ta te" ) .

A (grammat ica l )  sente 'nce  shou ld  now be de f ined  as the ( le f t - to - r ight )  conca-  
tenat ion  of the le t te rs  p roduced  by the source ,  when pass ing  f rom the in i t ia l  
s ta te  to the f ina l  s ta te .  
The length  of a sentence  is  de f ined  as the number  of  le t te rs  in the sentence .  
To s imp l i fy  mat ters  w i thout  d ropp ing  much of genera l i ty  we a l so  requ i re  that  
d) The greates t  common d iv i sor  fo r  a l l  the poss ib le  lengths  of sentences  is  = l 
( i . e . ,  the source  becomes  an aper iod ic  source ,  i f  i t  is  shor t -c i rcu i ted  by  
ident i fy ing  the f ina l  and in i t ia l  s ta tes ) .  ~- 
With the proper t ies  a - d above ,  the source  obta ined  by  ident i fy ing  the f ina l  
and in i t ia l  s ta tes  is  an indecomposab le ,  e rgod ic  Markov  process  (cf. Fe l le r ,  
"P robab i l i ty  Theory  and Its App l i ca t ions" ,  ch.  15, N. Y. s 1950). 
In the t rans i t ion  matr ix  M fo r  a Markov  grammar  of our  type  a l l  e lements  
in the f i r s t  co lumn are  zero ,  and in the las t  row a l l  e lements  a re  zero  ex -  
cept  the las t  one wh ich  is  = 1. For  a g iven  Markov  grammar  we de f ine  the 
uncer ta in ty  or  ent ropy ,  Hi ,  fo r  each  s ta te  S i, i = 0, 1 . . . .  , n, as :  
n 
Hi=~l  Pij l ?g  P i j ;  i=  1, Z . . . . .  n.  
j=O 
We a lso  de f ine  the ent ropy ,  H or  H(M),  fo r  the grammar  as 
n= 1 
(1). = x.H.  
1 1 
i= 0 
where  x = (x0, x z, . . . ,  Xn_l)  is  de f ined  as the s ta t ionary  d i s t r ibut ion -~ the 
source  obta ined  when S O and S n a re  ident i f ied ;  thus  x is  de f ined  as the  (un ique)  
so lu t ion  to the set  of  s imu l taneous  equat ions  
(z) 
xM 1 = x 
x0 + X l + ' ' "  + Xn-1 = 1 
where  M 1 is  fo rmed by  sh i f t ing  the las t  and f i r s t  co lumns  and then  omi t t ing  
the las t  row and co lumn.  The mean sentence  length .  ~, of  the set  of g rammat -  
i ca l  sentences  can now be eas i ly  ca lcu la ted  as 
(3) = 1/x 0 
(cf. Feller, op. tit.) 
2. Embedded Grammars  
We now assume that  we have two Markov  grammars ,  M and M1, w i th  s ta tes  
S O , S 1 . . . .  , S n,  and  T o , T I, . . . ,  T m,  respect ive ly ,  where  S O ands  n, T O 
and T m are  the cor respond ing  in i t ia l  and  f ina l  s ta tes .  Now cons ider  two 
s ta tes  S i and S k in the grammar  M; assume that  the cor respond ing  t rans i t ion  
probab i l i ty  is = Pik" We now t rans form the grammar ,  M1, into a new one ,  
M\ ] ,  by  embedd ing  the grammar  M 2 in  M 1 between the s ta tes  S i and Sk, an 
operat ion  which  is per fo rmed by ident i fy ing  the s ta tes  T O and T wi th  the m 
s ta tes  S i and S k respect ive ly .  Or ,  to be more  prec ise ,  assume that  in the 
grammar  M 1 the t rans i t ions  to the s ta tes  Tj ,  j~ l ,  has  the probab i l i t i es  q0j" 
Then,  in  the grammar  M ' ,  t rans i t ions  to a s ta te  T. f rom the s ta te  S. w i l l  
3 1 
take p lace  wi th  the probab i l i ty  =.Pikq0 j .  A re turn  to the s ta te  S k in  the "main"  
grammar  f rom an in termed ia te  s ta te  Tj in  M 1 takes  p lace  wi th  the probab i l i ty  
qjm" 
With the cond i t ions  above  fu l f i l l ed ,  we propose  that  the ent ropy  for  the. com-  
posed  grammar  be ca lcu la ted  accord ing  to the fo rmula :  
(4) H(M' )  = H(M)  + x ip ik  " ~I  " H(M| )  
1 + x iP ik  (~1 - 1) 
where  H(M) is  the ent ropy  of the grammar  M when there  is an ord inary  con-  
nect ion  (with probab i l i ty  Pik) between the s ta tes  S i and Sk, and  where  x. is  
1 
the inherent  p robab i l i ty  of be ing  in the state  S. under  the same cond i t ions .  
1 
~1 is the mean sentence  length  of the sentences  produced by the grammar  
M 1 a lone .  (It is  qu i te  natura l  that  th is  number  appears  as a we ight  in the 
fo rmula ,  s ince  if one is p roduc ing  a sentence  accord ing  to the grammar  M 
and ar r ives  at the s tate  S i and f rom there  "d ives"  into the grammar  M1, 
then ~1 is the expected  wa i t ing  t ime for  emerg ing  aga in  in the main  grammar  
M. )  The fac tor  x iP ik  may be in terpreted  as the combined  probab i l i ty  of ever  
a r r iv ing  at.S i and  there  choos ing  the path  over  to M 1 (you may,  of course ,  
choose qui te  another  path  f rom Si).  
The proo f  of fo rmula  (4) is  very ' s t ra ight fo rward ,  once  the premises  accord -  
ing to the above have  been g iven,  and  we omi t  i t  here ,  as it does not  g ive 
much ext ra  ins ight  to the theory .  THe fo rmula  may be extended to the case  
when there  are :more  than  one sub-grammar  embedded in the grammar  M ' ,  
by add ing s imi la r  te rms as the one standing,  to the r ight  in the numerator  
and  the denominator .  The impor tant  th ing here  is that  the fac tors  of the type 
x .p .~ depend on ly  on the probab i l i ty  mat r ix  for  the grammar  M and are  de-  1 1 pendent  of the sub-grammars  invo lved .  
3. Recur  s ive  or  Se l f -embedded Sources  ~-. .... 
It  is  now qui te  natura l  to a l low a grammar  to have  i t se l f  as a sub-grammar  
or  to a l low a grammar  M 1" to conta in  a grammar  M~. wh ich ,  in  i ts  tu rn ,  con-  
ta ins  M 1, and so on. The grammars  thus  obta ined  cannot ,  howeverB be re -  
wr i t ten  as an ord inary  Markov  grammar .  The re la t ion  between an ord inary  
Markov  grammar  and a recurs ive  one i s~exact ly  s imi la r  to the re la t ion  be-  
tween F in i te  s ta te  Languages  and Phrase  S t ructure  Languages .  
To be more  precise, assume that we have a set of Markov  grammars  M~ 
M l . . . . .  M~ where MI 0 is called the main  grammar  and in the sense that 
the process always starts at the initial state in M ~ and ceases when it 
reaches the final state in M 0. Each  of the grammars  may contain any number  
of the others (and itself) as sub-grammars .  The only restriction is that f rom 
any state in any one of the grammars  there should exist a path which ends up 
at  the f ina l  s ta te  of M O. 
Remark  
If we in terpret  a source  of our  k ind  as a Phrase  S t ructure  Language,  the re -  
wr i t ing  ru les  a re  a l l  of the fo l low ing  k ind :

where the S' s are all non-terminal symbols. (They stand for the names  of 
the states in the sources - M~,  l~i I . . . . .  M~and where  S O is assumed to be 
the initial symbol  /the Chomskyan S/ and S n is the terminating state which 
produces the sentence delimiter #. The symbols Aik ar e either terminal sym-  
bols / l e t te rs  f rom a f in i te  a lphabet /  o r  non- termina l  symbo ls  equa l  to the

ta ined  are  ord inar i l y  Markov  grammars  accord ing  to our  de f in i t ion ,  and  the 
ent rop ies  Hj = H(Mj)  a re  eas i ly  computed  accord ing  to fo rmula  (1), as  a re  
the s ta t ionary  d i s t r ibut ions  / fo rmula  (2 ) / .  The fo l lwo ing  theorem shows how

Assume now that  we have  a Markov  grammar  of our  type ,  but  fo r  wh ich  
each  t rans i t ion  w i l l  take  a cer ta in  amount  of t ime.  A very  natura l  quest ion  
i s  then:  "What  i s  the expected  t ime to produce  a sentence  in that  language ?"  
The answer  is  in the fo l low ing  lemma.  
Lemma 
Let  M be a_MMarkov grammar  w i th  s ta tes  S i ,  i=  O, 
S a re  the in i t ia l  and  f ina l  s ta tes  respect ive ly ,

Assume that  each  t rans i t ion  S i -. S k w i l l  take  Ylk t ime un i ts .  
Denote the expected t ime for arrival at S given that the grammar  is in state 
n 
S i by ti, i = 0, I, ...~ n~ (thus t o is the expected t ime for producing asen-  
tence). The  t imes t I will then fulfill the following set of simultaneously linear 
equations : 
(7) t i  = ~ P ik  ( t ik  + tk) 
k 
Formula  (7) i s  i t se l f  a p roo f  of the lemrna .  
Wi th  more  conven ient  notat ions  we can  wr i te  (7) as  
(E - P)  t = Pt 
where  E is  the un i t  mat r ix ,  P is  the probab i l i ty  matr ix  (w i th  P = 0) and  
nn 
Pt is  the vector  w i th  components  
Pi (t) =~ P im t im'  i = 0, 1 . . . .  , n.  
m 
The app l i ca t ion  of  ~he lemma for  comput ing  the numbers  ~k in fo rmula  (6) i s  
now the fo l low ing .  
The transition t imes of the lemma are, of course, the expected t ime (or 
"lengths" as we have called it earlier) for passing via a sub-grammar  of the 
grammar  under consideration. Thus the number  tik i-~\]itself the unknown en- 
title s ~k"

For  each  of  the sub-grammars  M~, j : 0, I ,  . . . ,  N, we geta  set  of l inear  
J 
equat ions  of type  (7) for  determin ing  the vectors  t of 1emma.  The f i r s t  com-  
ponent  of th i s  vector ,  i .e . j  the number  t O , i s  then  equa l  to the expected  
length ,  ~, of the sentences  of that  g~ammar .  (Unfor tunate ly ,  we have  to 
compute  ext ra  the expected  t ime fo r  go ing  f rom any  s ta te  of the  sub-gram-  
mars  to the  cor respond ing  f ina l  s ta te . )  
The to ta l  number  of unknowns  invo lved  when comput ing  the ent ropy  of  our  
g rammar  (i .  e .  , the ent ropy  H~) i s  equa l  to 
(the to ta l  number  of s ta tes  in a l l  our  sub-grammars)  p lus  
(the number  of sub-grammars) .  
Th is  i s  a l so  the number  of equat io r~,_ for  we haven + 1 e~uat ions  f rom formula  
(6) and then  (n + 1) se ts  of equat ions  of  the type  (7). We asser t  that  a l l  these  
s imul taneous  equat ions  a~e so lvab le ,  i f  the grammar  fu l f i l l s  the cond i t ions  
we ear l ie r  s ta ted  fo r  the grammar ,  i .e . ,  that  f rom 'each  s ta te  in any  sub-  
g rammar  ex is ts  a t  leas t  one path  to the f ina l  s ta te  of  that  g rammar .
