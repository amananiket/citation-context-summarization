Abstract 
This paper is concerned with the question of 
how to extract lexical knowledge from Machine- 
Readable Dictionaries (MRDs) within a lexi- 
cal database which integrates a lexicon devel- 
opment environment. Our long term objective 
is the creation of a large lexical knowledge base 
using semiautomatic techniques to recover syn- 
tactic and semantic information from MRDs. 
In doing so, one finds that reliance on a single 
MRD source induces inadequacies which could 
be efficiently redressed through access to com- 
bined MRD sources. In the general case, the 
integration of information from distinct MRDs 
remains a problem hard, perhaps impossible, to 
solve without the aid of a complete, linguisti- 
cally motivated atabase which provides a ref- 
erence point for comparison. Nevertheless, ad- 
vances can be made by attempting to correlate 
dictionaries which are not too dissimilar. In 
keeping with these observations, we describe a 
software package for correlating MRDs based 
on sense merging techniques and show how such 
a tool can be employed in augmenting a lexical 
knowledge base built from a conventional MRD 
with thesaurus information. 
1 In t roduct ion  
Over the last few years, the utilization of machine read- 
able dictionaries (MRDs) in compiling lexical compo- 
nents for Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems 
has awakened the interest of an increasing number of re- 
searchers. This trend has largely arisen from the recog- 
nition that access to a large scale Lexical Knowledge 
Base (LKB) is a s ine qua non  for real world applica- 
tions of NLP systems. Computer-aided acquisition of 
lexical knowledge from MRDs can be made to satisfy this 
prerequisite in a manner which is both time- and cost- 
effective. However, to maximize the utility of MRDs in 
*The research reported in this paper was carried out at 
the Computer Laboratory (University of Cambridge) as part 
of an ongoing study on the acquisition of lexical knowledge 
from machine-readable dictionaries within the ACQUILEX 
project, ESPRIT BRA 3030. 
NLP applications, it is necessary to overcome inconsis- 
tencies, omissions and the occasional errors which are 
commonly found in MRDs (Atkins el al., 1986; Atkins, 
1989; Akkerman, 1989; Boguraev & Briscoe, 1989). This 
goal can be partly achieved by developing tools which 
make it possible to correct errors and inconsistencies 
contained in the information structures automatically 
derived from the source MRD before these are stored 
in the LKB or target lexicon (Carroll & Grover, 1989). 
This technique is nevertheless of little avail in redress- 
ing inadequacies which arise from lack of information. 
In this case, manual supply of the missing information 
would be too time- and labour-intensive to be desirable. 
Moreover, the information which is missing can be usu- 
ally obtained from other MRD sources. Consider, for ex- 
ample, a situation in which we wanted to augment lexical 
representations available from a conventional dictionary 
with thesaurus information. There can be little doubt 
that the integration of information from distinct MRD 
sources would be far more convenient and appropriate 
than reliance on manual encoding. 
In the general case, the integration of information from 
distinct MRD sources for use within a lexicon develop- 
ment environment is probably going to remain an un- 
solved problem for quite some time. This is simply be- 
cause dictionaries eldom describe the same word using 
the same sense distinctions. Consequently, the integra- 
tion of information from distinct MRD sources through 
simple word-sense matches is likely to fail in a significant 
number of instances (Calzolari & Picchi, 1986; Atkins 
1987; Klavans 1988; Boguraev & Pustejovsky 1990). In- 
deed, Atkins & Levin (1990) have suggested that the 
task of mapping MRDs onto each other is so complex 
that the creation of a complete 'ideal' database which 
provides a reference point for the MRD sources to be in- 
tegrated may well be considered as an essential prereq- 
uisite. However, when dealing with MRD sources which 
use entry definitions which are not too dissimilar, a cor- 
relation technique based on word sense merging can be 
made to yield useful results, given the appropriate tools 
Although sense matching across dictionaries in this case 
too is prone to errors, there are several reasons why the 
effort is worthwhile. First, the number of correct sens~ 
matches across MRD sources in this case is guarantee~ 
to be high. Second, there are many instances in which at 
incorrect sense-to-sense match does not affect the fins 
80
result since the information with respect o which a sense 
correlation is being sought may generalize across closely 
related word senses. Third, a close inspection of infelici- 
tous matches provides a better understanding of specific 
difficulties involved in the task and may help develop 
solutions. Finally, the construction of a linguistically 
motivated atabase aimed to facilitate the interrogation 
of combined MRD sources would be highly enhanced by 
the availability of new tools for lexicology. Partial as 
it may be, the possibility of mapping MRDs onto each 
other through sense-merging techniques hould thus be 
seen as a step forward in the right direction. 
The goal of this paper is to describe a software pack- 
age for correlating word senses across dictionaries which 
can be straightforwardly tailored to an individual user's 
needs, and has convenient facilities for interactive sense 
matching. We also show how such a tool can be em- 
ployed in augmenting a lexical knowledge base built from 
a conventional MRD with thesaurus information. 
2 Background 
Our point of departure is the Lexical Data Base (LDB) 
and LKB tools developed at the Computer Laboratory 
in Cambridge within the context of the ACQUILEX 
project. The LDB (Carroll, 1990) gives flexible access 
to MRDs and is endowed with a graphic interface which 
provides a user-friendly environment for query formation 
and information retrieval. It allows several dictionaries 
to be loaded and queried in parallel.

main MRD and two derived ones) 
Until recently, this facility has been used to extract in- 
formation from combined MRD sources which included 
a main dictionary and a number of dictionaries derived 
from it. For example, the information needed to build 
LKB representations for English verbs (see below) was 
partly obtained by running LDB queries which combined 
information from the Longman Dictionary of Contempo- 
rary English (LDOCE) and two other dictionaries de- 
rived from LDOCE: LDOCE_Inter and LDOCE_Sem. 
LDOCE_Inter was derived by a translation program 
which mapped the grammar codes of LDOCE entries 
into theoretically neutral intermediate representations 
(Boguraev & Briscoe, 1989; Carroll & Grover, 1989). 
LDOCE_Sem was derived by extracting genus terms 
from dictionary definitions in LDOCE (Alshawi, 1989; 
Vossen, 1990). Figure 1 provides an illustrative xample 
of an LDB query which combines these MRD sources. 
We used these LDB facilities for running queries from 
combined MRD sources which included more than one 
MRD - -  i.e. LDOCE and the Longman Lexicon of Con- 
temporary English (LLOCE), a thesaurus closely related 
to LDOCE. 
The LKB provides a lexicon development environment 
which uses a typed graph-based unification formalism 
as  representation language. A detailed description of 
the LKB's representation language is given in papers 
by Copestake, de Paiva and Sanfilippo in Briscoe et al 
(forthcoming); various properties of the system are also 
discussed in Briscoe (1991) and Copestake (1992). The 
LKB allows the user to define an inheritance network 
of types plus restrictions associated with them, and to 
create lexicons where such types are assigned to lexi- 
cal templates extracted through LDB queries which give 
word-sense specific information. Consider, for exam- 
ple, the lexical template relative to the first LDOCE 
sense of the verb delight in (1) where sense specific infor- 
mation is integrated with a reference to the LKB type 
STRICT-TRANS-SIGII which provides a general syntactic 
and semantic haracterization f strict transitive verbs. 1

When loaded into the LKB, the lexical template above 
will expand into a full syntactic and semantic rep- 
resentation as shown in Figure 2; this representa- 
tion arises from integrating sense-specific information 
with the information structure associated with the type 
STRICT-TRANS-S IGNf i  
XThe type specification INDEF-0BJ in (1) corresponds to 
the LDB value Unaccusative (see Figure 1) and marks tran- 
sitive verbs which are amenable to the indefinite object alter- 
nation, e.g. a book which is certain to delight them vs. a book 
which is certain to delight. Information concerning diathesis 
alternations i also derived from LDOCElnter. The value 
TRUE for the attribute reg-morph indicates that delight has 
regular morphology. OBJ and E-ItlJI~N are sorted variables 
for individual objects. 
2According to the verb representation adopted in the LKB 
(Sanfilippo, forthcoming), verbs are treated as predicates of 
eventualities and thematic roles as relations between eventu- 
alities and individuMs (Parsons, 1990). The semantic ontent

Lexieal templates uch as the one in (1) are generated 
through a user definable conversion function - -  a facil- 
ity included in the LKB - -  which makes it possible to 
establish correspondences between information derived 
through LDB queries and LKB types. For example, 
information relative to selectional restrictions for tran- 
sitive verbs (e.g. e-human and obj in (1)) is encoded 
by establishing a correspondence b tween the value for 
the individual variables of the subject and object roles 
in LKB representations and the values retrieved from 
the relevant LDOCE entry for box codes 5 and 10 (see 
Figure 1). Similarly, the assignment of verb types (e.g. 
STRICT-TRANS-SIGN) to verb senses is carried out by re- 
lating LKB types for English verbs - -  about 30 in the 
current implementation (Sanfilippo, forthcoming) - -  to 
subcategorization patterns retrieved from LDOCE_Inter. 
For example, if a verb sense in LDOCE_Inter were asso- 
ciated with the information in (2), the conversion func- 
tion would associate the lexical template being generated 
with the type STRICT-TRANS-SIGN.

Needless to say, the amount of information specified in 
LKB entries will be directly proportional to the amount 
of information which can be reliably extracted through 
LDB queries. With respect to verbs, there are several 
of roles is computed in terms of entailments ofverb meanings 
which determine the most (p-agt) and least (p-pat) agentive 
event participants for each choice of predicate; see Figures 4 
and 5 for illustrative xample. This approach reproduces the 
insights of Dowty's and Jackendoff's treatments of thematic 
information (Dowty, 1991; Jackendoff, 1990) within a neo- 
Davidsonian approach to verb semantics (Sanfilippo, 1990). 
ways in which the representations derived from tem- 
plates such as the one in (1) can be enriched. In the 
simplest case, additional information can be recovered 
from a single MRD source either directly or through 
translation programs which allow the creation of derived 
dictionaries where information which is somehow con- 
tained in the source MRD can be made more explicit. 
This technique may however be insufficient or inappro- 
priate to recover certain kinds of information which are 
necessary in building an adequate verb lexicon. Consider 
the specification of verb class semantics. This is highly 
instrumental in establishing subcategorization a d reg- 
imenting lexically governed grammatical processes (see 
Levin (1989), Jackendoff (1990) and references therein) 
and should be thus included within a lexicon which sup- 
plied adequate information about verbs. For example, a
verb such as delight should be specified as a member of 
the class of verbs which express emotion, i.e. psycholog- 
ical verbs. As is well known (Levin, 1989; Jackendoff, 
1990), verbs which belong to this semantic lass can be 
classified according to the following parameters: 
* affect is positive (admire, delight), neutral (experi- 
ence, interest) or negative (fear, scare) 
? stimulus argument is realized as object and experi- 
encer as subject, e.g. admire, experience, fear 
? stimulus argument is realized as subject and expe- 
riencer as object, e.g. delight, interest, scare 
Psychological verbs with experiencer subjects are 'non- 
causative'; the stimulus of these verbs can be considered 
to be a 'source' to which the experiencer 'reacts emc, 
tively'. By contrast, psychological verbs with stimulu,, 
subjects involve 'causation'; the stimulus argument ma3 
be consided as a 'causative source' by which the experi. 
encer participant is 'emotively affected'. Six subtypes o
psychological verbs can thus be distinguished accordint 
to semantic properties of the stimulus and experience: 
arguments as shown in (3) where the verb delight is spec 
ified as belonging to one of these subtypes.

Correct classification of members of the six ver 
classes in (3) through LDB queries which used as soure 
a standard dictionary (e.g. LDOCE) is a fairly hopele~, 
pursuit. Standard dictionaries are simply not equippe 
to offer this kind of information with consistency an 
exhaustiveness. Furthermore, the technique of creatin 
derived dictionaries where the information contained i 
a main source MRD is made more explicit is unhel\[ 
ful in this case. For example, one approach would b 
scare  
82
to derive a dictionary from LDOCE where verbs are or- 
ganized into a network defined by IS-A links using the 
general approach to taxonomy formation described by 
Amsler (1981). Such an approach would involve the for- 
mation of chains through verb definitions determined by 
the genus term of each definition. Unfortunately, the 
genus of verb definitions is often not specific enough to 
supply a taxonomic haracterization which allows for the 
identification of semantic verb classes with consistency 
and exhaustiveness. In LDOCE, for example, the genus 
of over 20% of verb senses (about 3,500) is one of 8 verbs: 
cause, make, be, give, put, take, move, have; many of 
the word senses which have the same genus belong to 
distinct semantic verb classes. This is not to say that 
verb taxonomies are of no value, and in the final sec- 
tion we will briefly discuss an important application of 
verb taxonomies with respect to the assignment of se- 
mantic classes to verb senses. Nevertheless, the achieve- 
ment of adequate results requires techniques which re- 
classify entries in the same source MRD(s) rather than 
making explicit the classification 'implicit' in the lexi- 
cographer's choice of genus term. Thesauri provide an 
alternative semantically-motivated classification of lexi- 
cal items which is most naturally suited to reshape or 
augment he taxonomic structure which can be inferred 
from the genus of dictionary definitions. The LLOCE 
is a thesaurus which was developed from LDOCE and 
there is substantial overlap (although not identity) be- 
tween the definitions and entries of both MRDs. We 
decided to investigate the plausibility of semi-automatic 
sense correlations with LDOCE and LLOCE and to ex- 
plore the utility of the thesaurus classification for the 
classification of verbs in a linguistically motivated way. 
3 DCK:  A F lex ib le  Too l  fo r  Cor re la t ing  
Word  Senses  Across  MRDs 
Our immediate goal in developing an environment for 
correlating MRDs was thus to merge word senses, and in 
particular verb senses, from LDOCE and LLOCE. More 
generally, our aim was to provide a Dictionary Corre- 
lation Kit (DCK) containing a set of flexible tools that 
can be straightforwardly tailored to an individual user's 
needs, along with a facility for the interactive match- 
ing of dictionary entries. Our DCK is designed to cor- 
relate word senses across pairs of MRDs which have 
been mounted on the LDB (henceforth source-dict and 
destination.dict) using a list of comparison heuristics. 
Entries from the source-dict and destination-dict are 
compared to yield a set of correlation structures which 
describe matches between word senses in the two dictio- 
naries. A function is provided that converts correlation 
structures into entries of a derived dictionary which can 
be mounted and queried on the LDB. 
3.1 General Functionality of  DCK 
Entry fields in the source-dict and destination-dict are 
compared by means of comparators. These are func- 
tions which take as input normalized field information 
extracted from the entries under analysis, and return 
two values: a score indicating the degree to which the 
two fields correlate, along with an advisory datum which 
indicates what kind of action to take. The objective 
of each match is to produce a correlation structure con- 
sisting of a source-dict sense and a set of destination-dict 
sense/score pairs representing possible matches. Prior to 
converting correlation structures into derived dictionary 
entries, the best match is selected for each correlation 
structure on the basis of the comparator scores. When 
there is ambiguity as to the best match, a correlation di- 
alog window pops up that allows the user to peruse the 
candidate matches and manually select the best match 
(see Figure 3). 
3.2 Customis lng  DCK 
Two categories of information must be provided in order 
to correlate a pair of new LDB-mounted ictionaries: 
* functions which normalize dictionary-dependent 
field values, and 
* dictionary independent comparators which provide 
matching heuristics. 
Field values describing the same information may be 
labeled differently across dictionaries. For example, pro- 
nouns may be tagged as Pron in the part-of-speech field 
of one dictionary and Pronoun in part-of-speech field of 
another dictionary. It is therefore necessary to provide 
normalizing functions which convert dictionary-specific 
field values into dictionary-independent o es which can 
be compared using generic comparators. 
Comparators take as arguments pairs of normalized 
field values relative to the senses of the two MRDs un- 
der comparison, and return a score associated with an 
advisory datum which indicates the course of action to 
be followed. The score and advisory datum provide an 
index of the degree of overlap between the two senses. 
3.3 Determining the Best Sense 
A correlation structure contains a list of destination-dict 
sense/score pairs which indicate possible matches with 
the corresponding source-dict sense. The most appro- 
priate match can be determined automatically using two 
user-provided parameters: 
1. the threshold, which indicates the minimal accept- 
able score that a comparator list must achieve for 
automatic sense selection, and 
2. the tolerance, which is the minimum difference be- 
tween the top two scores that must be achieved if 
the top sense with the highest score is to be selected. 
The sense/score pair with the highest score is automat- 
ically selected if: 
A. the advisory datum provides no indication that the 
correlation should be queried, 
B. the score relative to a single match exceeds the 
threshold, or 
C. the score relative to two or more matches exceeds 
the threshold, and the difference between the top 
two scores exceeds the tolerance. 
If either one of these conditions is not fulfilled, the cor- 
relation dialog is invoked to allow a manual choice to be 
made.

Figure 3: Sample interaction with correlation dialog 
3.4 The  Cor re la t ion  D ia log  
The correlation dialog allows the user to examine correla- 
tion structures and select none, one or more destination- 
dict senses to be matched with the source-dict sense un- 
der analysis. A typical interaction can be seen in Fig- 
ure 3. A scrollable window in the centre of the dia- 
log box provides information about the destination-dict 
senses and their associated scores. Single clicking the 
mouse button on one or more rows makes them the cur- 
rent selection. The large button above the threshold and 
tolerance indicators ummarizes source-dict sense infor- 
mation. Clicking on this button invokes an LDB query 
window which inspects the source-dict sense (cf. bottom 
left window in Figure 3). 
The dialog can be in one of three modes: 
? Explain Scores - -  the mode specific key pops up a 
window for each destination-dict sense in the cur- 
rent selection, explaining how each score was ob- 
tained from the comparators; 
? Display Entries - -  the mode specific key invokes 
standard LDB browsers on the destination-dict 
senses in the current selection (cf. top-left window 
in Figure 3), and 
? Accept Entries - -  the mode specific key terminates 
the dialog and accepts the current selection as the 
best match. 
Two additional buttons on the top right of the dialog box 
allow the current selection to be accepted independent 
of the current mode, or all senses to be rejected (i.e. 
no match is found). At the bottom of the screen, two 
'thermometers'  allow the user to adjust the threshold 
and tolerance parameters dynamically. 
4 Using DCK 
We run DCK with LLOCE as source-dict and LDOCE 
as destination-dict to produce a derived dictionary, 
LDOCE_Link, which when loaded together with LDOCE 
would allow us to form LDOCE queries which inte- 
grated thesaurus information from LLOCE. The work 
was carried out with specific reference to verbs which 
express 'Feelings, Emotions, Attitudes, and Sensations' 
and 'Movement, Location, Travel, and Transport '  (sets 
'F '  and 'M'  in LLOCE). Correlation structures were de- 
rived for 1194 verb senses (over 1/5 of all verb senses in 
LLOCE) using as matching parameters degree of overlap 
in grammar codes, definitions and examples, as well as 
equality in headword and part-of-speech. After some 
trim runs, correlations appeared to yield best results 
when all parameters were assigned the same weight ex- 
cept the comparator for 'degree of overlap in examples' 
which was set to be twice as determinant than the oth- 
ers. Tolerance was set at 7% and threshold at 65%. The 
rate of interactions through the correlation dialog was 
about one for every 8-10 senses. It took about 10 hours 
running time on a Macintosh I Icx to complete the work, 
with less than three hours' worth of interactions. 
A close examination of over 500 correlated entries dis- 
closed an extremely low incidence of infelicitous matches 
(below 1%). In some cases, sense-matching inadequacies 
could be easily redressed without reassignment of corre- 
lation links. For example, DCK erroneously correlated 
the verb sense for float in LLOCE with the first verb 
sense of float in LDOCE. As shown in (4), the LLOCE 
sense refers only to the intransitive use of the verb, while 
the LDOCE sense refers to both transitive and intransi- 
tive uses of the verb (i.e. the LLOCE sense is subsumed 
84
by LDOCE sense). 
(4) a LLOCE 
float\[I0\] to stay on or very near the 
surface of a liquid, esp. water 
b LDOCE 
float 2 v 1 \[10;T1\] to (cause to) stay at 
the top of a liquid or be held up in the 
air without sinking water 
One way to redress this kind of inadequate match would 
be to augment DCK with a lexical rule module cater- 
ing for diathesis alternations which made it possible to 
establish a clear relation between distinct syntactic re- 
alizations of the same verb. For example, the transitive 
and intransitive senses of float could be related to each 
other via the 'cansative/inchoative' alternation. This 
augmentation would be easy to implement since infor- 
mation about amenability of verbs to diathesis alterna- 
tions is recoverable from LDOCE_Inter, as shown below 
for float (Ergative is the term used in LDOCE-Inter to 
characterize verbs which like float are amenable to the 
causative/inchoative alternation).

Notice, incidentally, that even though DCK yielded 
an incorrect sense correlation for the verb entry float, 
the information which was inherited by LDOCE from 
LLOCE through the correlation link was still valid. In 
LLOCE, float is classified as a verb whose set, group 
and main identifiers are: floating-and-sinking, Shipping 
and Movement-location-travel-and-transport. This infor- 
mation is useful in establishing the semantic class of 
both the transitive and intransitive uses of float. This 
is also true in those rare cases where DCK incorrectly 
preferred a sense match to another as shown below for 
the first LLOCE sense of behave which DCK linked 
to the third LDOCE sense rather than the first. Ei- 
ther sense of behave is adequately characterized by the 
set, group and main identifiers 'behaving', Feeling-and- 
behaviour-generally', and 'Feelings-emotions-attitudes- 
and-sensations' which LDOCE inherits from LLOCE 
through the incorrect sense correlation established by 
DCK.

5 LKB Encod ing of Lexical Knowledge 
from Combined MRD Sources 
LDOCE_Link was derived as a list of entries consisting of 
correlated LLOCE-LDOCE sense pairs plus an explicit 
reference to the corresponding set identifier in LLOCE, 
as shown in (7). 
(7) ((amaze) 
(LL F237 < amaze < 0)) 
((desire) (2 I < <)

Loading LDOCE with LDOCE_L ink  makes it possible to 
form LDOCE queries which include thesaurus informa- 
tion from LLOCE (i.e. the set identifiers). The integra- 
tion of thesaurus information provides adequate means 
for developing a semantic classification of verbs. With 
respect to psychological verbs, for example, the set iden- 
tifiers proved to be very helpful in identifying members 
of the six subtypes described in (3). The properties used 
in this classification could thus be used to define a hierar- 
chy of thematic types in the LKB which gave a detailed 
characterization of argument roles. This is shown in the 
lattice fragment in Figure 4 where the underlined types 
correspond to the role types used to distinguish the six 
semantic varieties of psychological predicates. 3 
The correspondence between LLOCE set identifiers 
and the thematic role types shown in Figure 4 made it 
possible to create word-sense templates for psychological 
verbs from LDB queries which in addition to providing 
information about morphological paradigm, subcatego- 
rization patterns, diathesis alternations and selectional 
restrictions, supplied thematic restrictions on the stimu- 
lus and experiencer roles. Illustrative LKB entries rela- 
tive to the six verb subtypes described in (3) are shown 
in Figure 5. 
6 Final Remarks  
Taking into consideration the size of the LLOCE frag- 
ment correlated to LDOCE (1/5 of LLOCE verb senses) 
and the results obtained, it seems reasonable to expect 
that this work should extend straightforwardly to other 
verbs as well as word senses of different category types. 
As far as we were able to establish, the major limi- 
tation of the work carried out arises from the fact that 
the entries and senses per homonyn in the source dictio- 
nary were considerably fewer than those in the destina- 
tion dictionary (e.g. 16,049 entries with 25,100 senses 
in LLOCE vs. 41,122 entries with 74,086 senses in 
LDOCE). Consequently, many senses of correlated verb 
entries as well as entire verb entries in LDOCE are bound 
to be left without a specification of thesaurus informa- 
tion. We are currently exploring the possibility of us- 
ing verb taxonomies to extend the results of LLOCE- 
LDOCE correlations to those LDOCE entries and verb 
3The labels 'p-agt' and 'p-pat' are abbreviations for 
'proto-typica\]' gent and patient roles which subsume clusters 
of entailments of verb meanings which qualify the most and 
least agentive vent participants for each choice of predicate 
(see footnote 2).

LLOCE entry/sense. The basic idea is to derive top- LLOCE set identifiers across verb senses where appropri- 
down taxonomies using as parent nodes verb entries for ate - -  and let the daughter nodes of these taxonomie~, 
inherit the thesaurus pecifications associated with th(

parent nodes. We expect that this use of verb taxon- 
omy should provide a significant solution for the lack of 
sense-to-sense correlations due to differences in size.
