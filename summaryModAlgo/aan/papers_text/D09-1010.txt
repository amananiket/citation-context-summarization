Abstract
In this paper, we propose a novel class
of graphs, the tripartite directed acyclic
graphs (tDAGs), to model first-order rule
feature spaces for sentence pair classifi-
cation. We introduce a novel algorithm
for computing the similarity in first-order
rewrite rule feature spaces. Our algorithm
is extremely efficient and, as it computes
the similarity of instances that can be rep-
resented in explicit feature spaces, it is a
valid kernel function.
1 Introduction
Natural language processing models are generally
positive combinations between linguistic models
and automatically learnt classifiers. As trees are
extremely important in many linguistic theories, a
large amount of works exploiting machine learn-
ing algorithms for NLP tasks has been developed
for this class of data structures (Collins and Duffy,
2002; Moschitti, 2004). These works propose ef-
ficient algorithms for determining the similarity
among two trees in tree fragment feature spaces.
Yet, some NLP tasks such as textual entail-
ment recognition (Dagan and Glickman, 2004;
Dagan et al, 2006) and some linguistic theories
such as HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1994) require
more general graphs and, then, more general al-
gorithms for computing similarity among graphs.
Unfortunately, algorithms for computing similar-
ity among two general graphs in term of com-
mon subgraphs are still exponential (Ramon and
Ga?rtner, 2003). In these cases, approximated al-
gorithms have been proposed. For example, the
one proposed in (Ga?rtner, 2003) counts the num-
ber of subpaths in common. The same happens for
the one proposed in (Suzuki et al, 2003) that is
applicable to a particular class of graphs, i.e. the
hierarchical directed acyclic graphs. These algo-
rithms do not compute the number of subgraphs
in common between two graphs. Then, these al-
gorithms approximate the feature spaces we need
in these NLP tasks. For computing similarities in
these feature spaces, we have to investigate if we
can define a particular class of graphs for the class
of tasks we want to solve. Once we focused the
class of graph, we can explore efficient similarity
algorithms.
A very important class of graphs can be de-
fined for tasks involving sentence pairs. In these
cases, an important class of feature spaces is the
one that represents first-order rewrite rules. For
example, in textual entailment recognition (Da-
gan et al, 2006), we need to determine whether
a text T implies a hypothesis H , e.g., whether or
not ?Farmers feed cows animal extracts? entails
?Cows eat animal extracts? (T
1
,H
1
). If we want
to learn textual entailment classifiers, we need
to exploit first-order rules hidden in training in-
stances. To positively exploit the training instance
?Pediatricians suggest women to feed newborns
breast milk? entails ?Pediatricians suggest that
newborns eat breast milk? (T
2
,H
2
) for classify-
ing the above example, learning algorithms should
learn that the two instances hide the first-order rule
? = feed
Y Z
?
Y
eat
Z . The first-order
rule feature space, introduced by (Zanzotto and
Moschitti, 2006), gives high performances in term
of accuracy for textual entailment recognition with
respect to other features spaces.
In this paper, we propose a novel class of
graphs, the tripartite directed acyclic graphs
(tDAGs), that model first-order rule feature spaces
and, using this class of graphs, we introduce a
novel algorithm for computing the similarity in
first-order rewrite rule feature spaces. The possi-
bility of explicitly representing the first-order fea-
ture space as subgraphs of tDAGs makes the de-
rived similarity function a valid kernel. With re-
spect to the algorithm proposed in (Moschitti and
Zanzotto, 2007), our algorithm is more efficient
91
and it is a valid kernel function.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2,
we firstly describe tripartite directed acyclic
graphs (tDAGs) to model first-order feature (FOR)
spaces. In Sec. 3, we then present the related
work. In Sec. 4, we introduce the similarity func-
tion for these FOR spaces. This can be used as ker-
nel function in kernel-based machines (e.g., sup-
port vector machines (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995)).
We then introduce our efficient algorithm for com-
puting the similarity among tDAGs. In Sec. 5,
we analyze the computational efficiency of our
algorithm showing that it is extremely more ef-
ficient than the algorithm proposed in (Moschitti
and Zanzotto, 2007). Finally, in Sec. 6, we draw
conclusions and plan the future work.
2 Representing first-order rules and
sentence pairs as tripartite directed
acyclic graphs
As first step, we want to define the tripartite di-
rected acyclic graphs (tDAGs). This is an ex-
tremely important class of graphs for the first-
order rule feature spaces we want to model. We
want here to intuitively show that, if we model
first-order rules and sentence pairs as tDAGs, de-
termining whether or not a sentence pair can be
unified with a first-order rewrite rule is a graph
matching problem. This intuitive idea helps in
determining our efficient algorithm for exploiting
first-order rules in learning examples.
To illustrate the above idea we will use an ex-
ample based on the above rule ?= feedY Z ?
Y
eat
Z and the above sentence pair (T
1
,H
1
).
The rule ? encodes the entailment relation of the
verb to feed and the verb to eat. If represented
over a syntactic interpretation, the rule has the fol-
lowing aspect:
?
1
=
VP
VB
feed
NP Y NP Z ?
S
NP Y VP
VB
eat
NP Z
As in the case of feature structures (Carpenter,
1992), we can observe this rule as a graph. As
we are not interested in the variable names but we
need to know the relation between the right hand
side and the left hand side of the rule, we can
substitute each variable with an unlabelled node.
We then connect tree nodes having variables with

Figure 2: A sample pair seen as a graph
the corresponding unlabelled node. The result is a
graph as the one in Fig. 1. The variables Y and Z
are represented by the unlabelled nodes between
the trees.
In the same way we can represent the sentence
pair (T
1
,H
1
) using graph with explicit links be-
tween related words and nodes (see Fig. 2). We
can link words using anchoring methods as in
(Raina et al, 2005). These links can then be prop-
agated in the syntactic tree using semantic heads
of the constituents (Pollard and Sag, 1994). The
rule ?
1
matches over the pair (T
1
,H
1
) if the graph
?
1
is among the subgraphs of the graph in Fig. 2.
Both rules and sentence pairs are graphs of the
same type. These graphs are basically two trees
connected through an intermediate set of nodes
representing variables in the rules and relations be-
tween nodes in the sentence pairs. We will here-
after call these graphs tripartite directed acyclic
graphs (tDAGs). The formal definition follows.
Definition tDAG: A tripartite directed acyclic
graph is a graph G = (N,E) where
? the set of nodes N is partitioned in three sets
N
t
, N
g
, and A
? the set of edges is partitioned in four sets E
t
,
E
g
, E
A
t
, and E
A
g
such that t = (N
t
, E
t
) and g = (N
g
, E
g
) are two
trees and E
A
t
= {(x, y)|x ? N
t
and y ? A} and
E
A
g
= {(x, y)|x ? N
g
and y ? A} are the edges
connecting the two trees.
A tDAG is a partially labeled graph. The label-
ing function L only applies to the subsets of nodes
related to the two trees, i.e., L : N
t
? N
g
? L.
Nodes in the set A are not labeled.
92
The explicit representation of the tDAG in Fig. 2
has been useful to show that the unification of a
rule and a sentence pair is a graph matching prob-
lem. Yet, it is complex to follow. We will then de-
scribe a tDAG with an alternative and more con-
venient representation. A tDAG G = (N,E)
can be seen as pair G = (?, ?) of extended trees
? and ? where ? = (N
t
? A,E
t
? E
A
t
) and
? = (N
g
? A,E
g
? E
A
g
). These are extended
trees as each tree contains the relations with the
other tree.
As for the feature structures, we will graphically
represent a (x, y) ? E
A
t
and a (z, y) ? E
A
g
as
boxes y respectively on the node x and on the
node z. These nodes will then appear as L(x) y
and L(z) y , e.g., NP 1 . The name y is not a label
but a placeholder representing an unlabelled node.
This representation is used for rules and for sen-
tence pairs. The sentence pair in Fig. 2 is then
represented as reported in Fig. 3.
3 Related work
Automatically learning classifiers for sentence
pairs is extremely important for applications like
textual entailment recognition, question answer-
ing, and machine translation.
In textual entailment recognition, it is not hard
to see graphs similar to tripartite directed acyclic
graphs as ways of extracting features from exam-
ples to feed automatic classifiers. Yet, these graphs
are generally not tripartite in the sense described
in the previous section and they are not used to ex-
tract features representing first-order rewrite rules.
In (Raina et al, 2005; Haghighi et al, 2005; Hickl
et al, 2006), two connected graphs representing
the two sentences s
1
and s
2
are used to compute
distance features, i.e., features representing the
distance between s
1
and s
2
. The underlying idea
is that lexical, syntactic, and semantic similarities
between sentences in a pair are relevant features
to classify sentence pairs in classes such as entail
and not-entail.
In (de Marneffe et al, 2006), first-order rewrite
rule feature spaces have been explored. Yet, these
spaces are extremely small. Only some features
representing first-order rules have been explored.
Pairs of graphs are used here to determine if a fea-
ture is active or not, i.e., the rule fires or not. A
larger feature space of rewrite rules has been im-
plicitly explored in (Wang and Neumann, 2007)
but this work considers only ground rewrite rules.
In (Zanzotto and Moschitti, 2006), tripartite di-
rected acyclic graphs are implicitly introduced and
exploited to build first-order rule feature spaces.
Yet, both in (Zanzotto and Moschitti, 2006) and
in (Moschitti and Zanzotto, 2007), the model pro-
posed has two major limitations: it can represent
rules with less than 7 variables and the proposed
kernel is not a completely valid kernel as it uses
the max function.
In machine translation, some methods such as
(Eisner, 2003) learn graph based rewrite rules for
generative purposes. Yet, the method presented in
(Eisner, 2003) can model first-order rewrite rules
only with a very small amount of variables, i.e.,
two or three variables.
4 An efficient algorithm for computing
the first-order rule space kernel
In this section, we present our idea for an effi-
cient algorithm for exploiting first-order rule fea-
ture spaces. In Sec. 4.1, we firstly define the simi-
larity function, i.e., the kernel K(G
1
, G
2
), that we
need to determine for correctly using first-order
rules feature spaces. This kernel is strongly based
on the isomorphism between graphs. A relevant
idea of this paper is the observation that we can
define an efficient way to detect the isomorphism
between the tDAGs (Sec. 4.2). This algorithm ex-
ploits the efficient algorithms of tree isomorphism
as the one implicitly used in (Collins and Duffy,
2002). After describing the isomorphism between
tDAGs, We can present the idea of our efficient al-
gorithm for computing K(G
1
, G
2
) (Sec. 4.3). We
introduce the algorithms to make it a viable solu-
tion (Sec. 4.4). Finally, in Sec. 4.5, we report the
kernel computation we compare against presented
by (Zanzotto and Moschitti, 2006; Moschitti and
Zanzotto, 2007).
4.1 Kernel functions over first-order rule
feature spaces
The first-order rule feature space we want to model
is huge. If we use kernel-based machine learning
models such as SVM (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995),
we can implicitly define the space by defining its
similarity functions, i.e., its kernel functions. We
firstly introduce the first-order rule feature space
and we then define the prototypical kernel function
over this space.
The first-order rule feature space (FOR) is in
general the space of all the possible first-order

Figure 3: Two tripartite DAGs
rules defined as tDAGs. Within this space it is pos-
sible to define the function S(G) that determines
all the possible active features of the tDAG G in
FOR. The function S(G) determines all the pos-
sible and meaningful subgraphs of G. We want
that these subgraphs represent first-order rules that
can be matched with the pair G. Then, meaningful
subgraphs of G = (?, ?) are graphs as (t, g) where
t and g are subtrees of ? and ?. For example, the
subgraphs of P
1
and P
2
in Fig. 3 are hereafter par-
tially represented:

In the FOR space, the kernel function K should
then compute the number of subgraphs in com-
mon. The trivial way to describe the former kernel
function is using the intersection operator, i.e., the
kernel K(G
1
, G
2
) is the following:
K(G
1
, G
2
) = |S(G
1
) ? S(G
2
)| (1)
This is very simple to write and it is in principle
correct. A graph g in the intersection S(G
1
) ?
S(G
2
) is a graph that belongs to both S(G
1
) and
S(G
2
). Yet, this hides a very important fact: de-
termining whether two graphs, g
1
and g
2
, are the
same graph g
1
= g
2
is not trivial. For example,
it is not sufficient to superficially compare graphs
to determine that ?
1
belongs both to S
1
and S
2
.
We need to use the correct property for g
1
= g
2
,
i.e., the isomorphism between two graphs. We can
call the operator Iso(g
1
, g
2
). When two graphs
verify the property Iso(g
1
, g
2
), both g
1
and g
2
can be taken as the graph g representing the two
graphs. Detecting Iso(g
1
, g
2
) has an exponential
complexity (Ko?bler et al, 1993).
This complexity of the intersection operator be-
tween sets of graphs deserves a different way to
represent the operation. We will use the same sym-
bol but we will use the prefix notation. The opera-
tor is hereafter re-defined:
? (S(G
1
),S(G
2
)) =
= {g
1
|g
1
? S(G
1
),?g
2
? S(G
2
), Iso(g
1
, g
2
)}
4.2 Isomorphism between tDAGs
As isomorphism between graphs is an essential ac-
tivity for learning from structured data, we here
review its definition and we adapt it to tDAGs.
94
We then observe that isomorphism between two
tDAGs can be divided in two sub-problems:
? finding the isomorphism between two pairs
of extended trees
? checking whether the partial isomorphism
found between the two pairs of extended trees
are compatible.
In general, two tDAGs, G
1
= (N
1
, E
1
) and
G
2
= (N
2
, E
2
) are isomorphic (or match) if
|N
1
| = |N
2
|, |E
1
| = |E
2
|, and a bijective func-
tion f : N
1
? N
2
exists such that these properties
hold:
? for each node n ? N
1
, L(f(n)) = L(n)
? for each edge (n
1
, n
2
) ? E
1
an edge
(f(n
1
), f(n
2
)) is in E
2
The bijective function f is a member of the combi-
natorial setF of all the possible bijective functions
between the two sets N
1
and N
2
.
The trivial algorithm for detecting if two graphs
are isomorphic is exponential (Ko?bler et al,
1993). It explores all the set F . It is still unde-
termined if the general graph isomorphism prob-
lem is NP-complete. Yet, we can use the fact that
tDAGs are two extended trees for building a bet-
ter algorithm. There is an efficient algorithm for
computing isomorphism between trees (as the one
implicitly used in (Collins and Duffy, 2002)).
Given two tDAGs G
1
= (?
1
, ?
1
) and G
2
=
(?
2
, ?
2
) the isomorphism problem can be divided
in detecting two properties:
1. Partial isomorphism. Two tDAGs G
1
and G
2
are partially isomorphic, if ?
1
and ?
2
are iso-
morphic and if ?
1
and ?
2
are isomorphic. The
partial isomorphism produces two bijective
functions f
?
and f
?
.
2. Constraint compatibility. Two bijective func-
tions f
?
and f
?
are compatible on the sets of
nodes A
1
and A
2
, if for each n ? A
1
, it hap-
pens that f
?
(n) = f
?
(n).
We can rephrase the second property, i.e., the
constraint compatibility, as follows. We de-
fine two constraints c(?
1
, ?
2
) and c(?
1
, ?
2
) rep-
resenting the functions f
?
and f
?
on the sets
A
1
and A
2
. The two constraints are defined as
c(?
1
, ?
2
) = {(n, f
?
(n))|n ? A
1
} and c(?
1
, ?
2
) =
{(n, f
?
(n))|n ? A
1
}. Two partially isomorphic
tDAGs are isomorphic if the constraints match,
i.e., c(?
1
, ?
2
) = c(?
1
, ?
2
).

4.3 General idea for an efficient kernel
function
As above discussed, two tDAGs are isomorphic if
the two properties, the partial isomorphism and
the constraint compatibility, hold. To compute the
kernel function K(G
1
, G
2
) defined in Sec. 4.1, we
can exploit these properties in the reverse order.
Given a constraint c, we can select all the graphs
that meet the constraint c (constraint compatibil-
ity). Having the two set of all the tDAGs meeting
the constraint, we can detect the partial isomor-
phism. We split each pair of tDAGs in the four
extended trees and we determine if these extended
trees are compatible.
We introduce this innovative method to com-
pute the kernel K(G
1
, G
2
) in the FOR space in
two steps. Firstly, we give an intuitive explanation
and, secondly, we formally define the kernel.
4.3.1 Intuitive explanation
To give an intuition of the kernel computation,
without loss of generality and for sake of simplic-
ity, we use two non-linguistic tDAGs, P
a
and P
b
(see Fig. 5), and the subgraph function ?S(?). This
latter is an approximated version of S(?) that gen-
erates tDAGs with subtrees rooted in the root of
the initial trees of ?.
To exploit the constraint compatibility
property, we define C as the set of all the
relevant alternative constraints, i.e., the con-
straints c that are likely to be generated
when detecting the partial isomorphism.
For P
a
and P
b

and compatible with the constraint c, i.e., c? ? c.

?

))|
c

belongs to the set as its con-
straint c? = {( 1 , 1 )} is a subset of c

.
Observing the kernel computation in this way
is important. Elements in ?( ?S(P

?
S(P

c
already satisfy the property of constraint com-
patibility. We only need to determine if the
partially isomorphic properties hold for elements
in ?( ?S(P

S(P

. Then, we can write the

Figure 4 reports this equivalence for the two
sets derived using the constraints c

.
Note that this equivalence is not valid if a con-
straint is not applied, i.e., ?( ?S(P

?
S(P

?(

?
S(?

?
S(?

?
S(?

The equivalence (2) allows to compute the car-

?
S(P

using the cardinal-
ities of ?( ?S(?

?

c
and ?( ?S(?

c
.
These latter sets contain only extended trees where
the equivalences between unlabelled nodes are
given by c. We can then compute the cardinali-
ties of these two sets using methods developed for
trees (e.g., the kernel function K
S
(?
1
, ?
2
) intro-
duced in (Collins and Duffy, 2002)).
4.3.2 Formal definition
Given the idea of the previous section, it is easy
to demonstrate that the kernel K(G
1
, G
2
) can be
written as follows:
K(G
1
,G
2
)=
|
?
c?C
?(S(?
1
),S(?
2
))|
c
??(S(?
1
),S(?
2
))|
c
|
where C is set of alternative constraints and
?(S(?
1
),S(?
2
))|
c
are all the common extended
trees compatible with the constraint c.
We can compute the above kernel using the
inclusion-exclusion property, i.e.,
|A
1
? ? ? ? ?A
n
| =
?
J?2
{1,...,n}
(?1)
|J |?1
|A
J
| (3)
where 2{1,...,n} is the set of all the subsets of
{1, . . . , n} and A
J
=
?
i?J
A
i
.
To describe the application of the inclusion-
exclusion model in our case, let firstly define:
K
S
(?
1
, ?
2
, c) = |?(S(?
1
),S(?
2
))|
c
| (4)
96
where ?
1
can be both ?
1
and ?
1
and ?
2
can be both
?
2
and ?
2
. Trivially, we can demonstrate that:
K(G
1
, G
2
) =
=
?
J?2
{1,...,|C|}
(?1)
|J|?1
K
S
(?
1
,?
2
,c(J))K
S
(?
1
,?
2
,c(J))
(5)
where c(J) =
?
i?J
c
i
.
Given the nature of the constraint set C , we
can compute efficiently the previous equation as
it often happens that two different J
1
and J
2
in
2
{1,...,|C|} generate the same c, i.e.
c =
?
i?J
1
c
i
=
?
i?J
2
c
i
(6)
Then, we can define C? as the set of all intersec-
tions of constraints in C , i.e. C? = {c(J)|J ?
2
{1,...,|C|}
}. We can rewrite the equation as:
K(G
1
, G
2
) =
=
?
c?C
?
K
S
(?
1
, ?
2
, c)K
S
(?
1
, ?
2
, c)N(c) (7)
where
N(c) =
?
J?2
{1,...,|C|}
c=c(J)
(?1)
|J |?1 (8)
The complexity of the above kernel strongly de-
pends on the cardinality of C and the related cardi-
nality of C?. The worst-case computational com-
plexity is still exponential with respect to the size
of A
1
and A
2
. Yet, the average case complexity
(Wang, 1997) is promising.
The set C is generally very small with re-
spect to the worst case. If F
(A
1
,A
2
)
are all the
possible correspondences between the nodes
A
1
and A
2
, it happens that |C| << |F
(A
1
,A
2
)
|
where |F
(A
1
,A
2
)
| is the worst case. For example,
in the case of P
1
and P
2
, the cardinality of
C =
{
{(
1
,
1
)}, {(
1
,
3
), (
3
,
4
), (
2
,
5
)}
}
is extremely smaller than the one of
F
(A
1
,A
2
)
= {{( 1 , 1 ),( 2 , 2 ),( 3 , 3 )},
{( 1 , 2 ),( 2 , 1 ),( 3 , 3 )}, {( 1 , 2 ),( 2 , 3 ),( 3 , 1 )},
..., {( 1 , 3 ),( 2 , 4 ),( 3 , 5 )}}. In Sec. 4.5 we argue
that the algorithm presented in (Moschitti and
Zanzotto, 2007) has the worst-case complexity.
Moreover, the set C? is extremely smaller than
2
{1,...,|C|} due to the above property (6).
We will analyze the average-case complex-
ity with respect to the worst-case complexity in
Sec. 5.
4.4 Enabling the efficient kernel function
The above idea for computing the kernel function
is extremely interesting. Yet, we need to make it
viable by describing the way we can determine ef-
ficiently the three main parts of the equation (7):
1) the set of alternative constraints C (Sec. 4.4.1);
2) the set C? of all the possible intersections of
constraints in C (Sec. 4.4.2); and, finally, 3) the
numbers N(c) (Sec. 4.4.3).
4.4.1 Determining the set of alternative
constraints
The first step of equation (7) is to determine the
alternative constraints C . We can here strongly
use the possibility of dividing tDAGs in two trees.
We build C as C
?
? C
?
where: 1) C
?
are the
constraints obtained from pairs of isomorphic ex-
tended trees t
1
? S(?
1
) and t
2
? S(?
2
); 2) C
?
are
the constraints obtained from pairs of isomorphic
extended trees t
1
? S(?
1
) and t
2
? S(?
2
).
The idea for an efficient algorithm is that we
can compute the C without explicitly looking
at all the subgraphs involved. We instead use
and combine the constraints derived comparing
the productions of the extended trees. We can
compute then C
?
with the productions of ?
1
and
?
2
and C
?
with the productions of ?
1
and ?
2
.
For example (see Fig. 3), focusing on the ? , the
rule
NP
3
?
NN
2
NNS
3 of G
1
and
NP
4
?
NN
5
NNS
4 of G
2
generates the
constraint c = {( 3 , 4 ), (2 , 5 )}.
Using the above intuition it is possible to define
an algorithm that builds an alternative constraint
set C with the following two properties:
1. for each common subtree according to a set
of constraints c, ?c? ? C such that c ? c?;
2. @c?, c?? ? C such that c? ? c?? and c? 6= ?.
4.4.2 Determining the set C?
The set C? is defined as the set of all possible in-
tersections of alternative constraints in C . Figure
6 presents the algorithm determining C?. Due to
the property (6) discussed in Sec. 4.3, we can em-
pirically demonstrate that the average complexity
of the algorithm is not bigger than O(|C|2). Yet,
again, the worst case complexity is exponential.
4.4.3 Determining the values of N(c)
The multiplier N(c) (Eq. 8) represents the num-
ber of times the constraint c is considered in the
sum of equation 5, keeping into account the sign of

This recursive formulation of the equation allows
us to easily determine the value of N(c) for every
c belonging to C?. It is possible to prove this prop-
erty using set properties and the binomial theorem.
The proof is omitted for lack of space.
4.5 Reviewing the strictly related work
To understand if ours is an efficient algorithm, we
compare it with the algorithm presented by (Mos-
chitti and Zanzotto, 2007). We will hereafter call
this algorithm K
max
. The K
max
algorithm and
kernel is an approximation of what is a kernel
needed for a FOR space as it is not difficult to
demonstrate that K
max
(G
1
, G
2
) ? K(G
1
, G
2
).
The K
max
approximation is based on maximiza-
tion over the set of possible correspondences of
the placeholders. Following our formulation, this
kernel appears as:
K
max
(G
1
, G
2
) =
= max
c?F
(A
1
,A
2
)
K
S
(?
1
, ?
2
, c)K
S
(?
1
, ?
2
, c) (10)
where F
(A
1
,A
2
)
are all the possible correspon-
dences between the nodes A
1
and A
2
of the two
tDAGs as the one presented in Sec. 4.3. This for-
mulation of the kernel has the worst case complex-
ity of our formulation, i.e., Eq. 7.
For computing the basic kernel for the extended
trees, i.e. K
S
(?
1
, ?
2
, c) we use the model algo-
rithm presented by (Zanzotto and Moschitti, 2006)
and refined by (Moschitti and Zanzotto, 2007)
based on the algorithm for tree fragment feature

the same basic kernel, we can empirically compare
the two methods.
5 Experimental evaluation
In this section we want to empirically estimate the
benefits on the computational cost of our novel al-
gorithm with respect to the algorithm proposed by
(Moschitti and Zanzotto, 2007). Our algorithm is
in principle exponential with respect to the set of
alternative constraints C . Yet, due to what pre-
sented in Sec. 4.4 and as the set C? is usually
very small, the average complexity is extremely
low. Following the theory on the average-cost
computational complexity (Wang, 1997), we es-
timated the behavior of the algorithms on a large
distribution of cases. We then compared the com-
puting times of the two algorithms. Finally, as
K and K
max
compute slightly different kernels,
we compare the accuracy of the two methods.
We implemented both algorithms K(G
1
, G
2
) and
K
max
(G
1
, G
2
) in support vector machine classi-
fier (Joachims, 1999) and we experimented with
both implementations on the same machine. We
hereafter analyze the results in term of execution
time (Sec. 5.1) and in term of accuracy (Sec. 5.2).
5.1 Average computing time analysis
For this first set of experiments, the source of ex-
amples is the one of the recognizing textual en-
tailment challenge, i.e., RTE2 (Bar-Haim et al,

)
Figure 8: Total execution time in seconds (s) of
the training phase on RTE2 wrt. different numbers
of allowed placeholders
2006). The dataset of the challenge has 1,600 sen-
tence pairs.
The computational cost of both K(G
1
, G
2
) and
K
max
(G
1
, G
2
) depends on the number of place-
holders n = |A
1
| of G
1
and on m = |A
2
| the
number of placeholders of G
2
. Then, in the first
experiment we want to determine the relation be-
tween the computational time and the factor n?m.
Results are reported in Fig. 7 where the computa-
tion times are plotted with respect to n?m. Each
point in the curve represents the average execu-
tion time for the pairs of instances having n ?m
placeholders. As expected, the computation of the
function K is more efficient than the computation
K
max
. The difference between the two execution
times increases with n?m.
We then performed a second experiment that
wants to determine the relation of the total exe-
cution with the maximum number of placeholders
in the examples. This is useful to estimate the be-
havior of the algorithm with respect to its applica-
tion in learning models. Using the RTE2 data, we
artificially build different versions with increasing
number of placeholders. We then have RTE2 with
1 placeholder at most in each pair, RTE2 with 2
placeholders, etc. The number of pairs in each set
is the same. What changes is the maximal num-
ber of placeholders. Results are reported in Fig. 8
where the execution time of the training phase in
seconds (s) is plotted for each different set. We
see that the computation of K
max
is exponential
with respect to the number of placeholders and

it becomes intractable after 7 placeholders. The
computation of K is instead more flat. This can
be explained as the computation of K is related
to the real alternative constraints that appears in
the dataset. The computation of the kernel K then
outperforms the computation of the kernel K
max
.
5.2 Accuracy analysis
As K
max
that has been demonstrated very effec-
tive in term of accuracy for RTE and K compute
a slightly different similarity function, we want to
show that the performance of our more computa-
tionally efficient K is comparable, and even better,
to the performances of K
max
. We then performed
an experiment taking as training all the data de-
rived from RTE1, RTE2, and RTE3, (i.e., 4567
training examples) and taking as testing RTE-4
(i.e., 1000 testing examples). The results are re-
ported in Tab. 1. As the table shows, the accuracy
of K is higher than the accuracy of K
max
. There
are two main reasons. The first is that K
max
is
an approximation of K . The second is that we
can now consider sentence pairs with more than
7 placeholders. Then, we can use the complete
training set as the third column of the table shows.
6 Conclusions and future work
We presented an interpretation of first order rule
feature spaces as tripartite directed acyclic graphs
(tDAGs). This view on the problem gave us the
possibility of defining a novel and efficient algo-
rithm for computing the kernel function for first
order rule feature spaces. Moreover, the resulting
algorithm is a valid kernel as it can be written as
dot product in the explicit space of the tDAG frag-
ments. We demonstrated that our algorithm out-
performs in term of average complexity the previ-
ous algorithm and it yields to better accuracies for
the final task. We are investigating if this is a valid
algorithm for two general directed acyclic graphs.
