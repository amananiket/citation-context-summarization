Abstract
The Edinburgh submissions to the shared task
of the Third Workshop on Statistical Machine
Translation (WMT-2008) incorporate recent
advances to the open source Moses system.
We made a special effort on the German?
English and English?German language pairs,
leading to substantial improvements.
1 Introduction
Edinburgh University participated in the shared task
of the ThirdWorkshop on Statistical Machine Trans-
lation (WMT-2008), which is partly funded by the
EUROMATRIX project, which also funds our work.
In this project, we set out to build machine trans-
lation systems for all language pairs of official EU
languages. Hence, we also participated in the shared
task in all language pairs.
For all language pairs, we used the Moses decoder
(Koehn et al, 2007), which follows the phrase-based
statistical machine translation approach (Koehn
et al, 2003), with default settings as a starting
point. We recently added minimum Bayes risk de-
coding and reordering constraints to the decoder. We
achieved consistent increase in BLEU scores with
these improvements, showing gains of up to 0.9%
BLEU on the 2008 news test set.
Most of our efforts were focused on the language
pairs German?English and English?German. For
both language pairs, we explored language-specific
and more general improvements, resulting in gains
of up to 1.5% BLEU for German?English and 1.4%
BLEU for English?German.
2 Recent Improvements
Over the last months, we added minimum Bayes risk
decoding and additional reordering constraints to the
Moses decoder. The WMT-2008 shared task offered
the opportunity to assess these components over a
large range of language pairs and tasks.
For all our experiments, we trained solely on the
Europarl corpus, which allowed us to treat the 2007
news commentary test set (nc-test2007) as a stand-
in for the 2008 news test set (news-2008), for which
we have no in-domain training data. This may have
resulted in lower performance due to less (and very
relevant) training data, but it also allowed us to opti-
mize for a true out-of-domain test set.
The baseline training uses Moses default param-
eters. We use a maximum sentence length of 80, a
phrase translation table with the five traditional fea-
tures, lexicalized reordering, and lowercase training
and test data. All reported BLEU scores are not case-
sensitive, computed using the NIST tool.
2.1 Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding
Minimum Bayes risk decoding was proposed by Ku-
mar and Byrne (2004). Instead of selecting the trans-
lation with the highest probability, minimum Bayes
risk decoding selects the translation that is most sim-
ilar to the highest scoring translations. Intuitively,
this avoid the selection of an outlier as the best trans-
lation, since the decision rule prefers translations
that are similar to other high-scoring translations.
Minimum Bayes risk decoding is defined as:
eMBR = argmaxe
?
e?
L(e, e?) p(e?|f)
As similarity function L, we use sentence-level
BLEU with add-one smoothing. As highest scoring
translations, we consider the top 100 distinct trans-
lations, for which we convert the translation scores
into a probability distribution p (with a scaling fac-
tor of 1). We tried other n-best list sizes and scaling
factors, with very similar outcomes.

Bayes risk decoding (MBR) and the monotone-at-punctuation reordering (MP) constraint.
2.2 Monotone at Punctuation
The reordering models in phrase-based translation
systems are known to be weak, since they essentially
relies on the interplay of language model, a general
preference for monotone translation, and (in the case
of lexicalized reordering) a local model based on a
window of neighboring phrase translations. Allow-
ing any kind of reordering typically reduces transla-
tion performance, so reordering is limited to a win-
dow of (in our case) six words.
One noticeable weakness is that the current model
frequently reorders words beyond clause bound-
aries, which is almost never well-motivated, and
leads to confusing translations. Since clause bound-
aries are often indicated by punctuation such as
comma, colon, or semicolon, it is straight-forward
to introduce a reordering constraint that addresses
this problem.
Our implementation of a monotone-at-punc-
tuation reordering constraint (Tillmann and Ney,
2003) requires that all input words before clause-
separating punctuation have be translated, before
words afterwards are covered. Note that this con-
straint does not limit in any way phrase translations
that span punctuation.
2.3 Results
Table 1 summarizes the impact of minimum
Bayes risk decoding (MBR) and the monotone-
at-punctuation reordering constraint (MP). Scores
show higher gains for out-of-domain news test sets
(+0.46) than for in-domain Europarl sets (+0.08).
3 German?English
Translating between German and English is surpris-
ingly difficult, given that the languages are closely
related. The main sources for this difficulty is the
different syntactic structure at the clause level and
the rich German morphology, including the merging
of noun compounds.
In prior work, we addressed reordering with a
pre-order model that transforms German for train-
ing and testing according to a set of hand-crafted
rules (Collins et al, 2005). Employing this method
to our baseline system leads to an improvement of
+0.8 BLEU on the nc-test2007 set and +0.5 BLEU on
the test2007 set.

Table 2: Impact of truecasing on case-sensitive BLEU
In a more integrated approach, factored transla-
tion models (Koehn and Hoang, 2007) allow us to
consider grammatical coherence in form of part-
of-speech language models. When translating into
output words, we also generate a part-of-speech tag
along with each output word. Since there are only 46
POS tags in English, we are able to train high-order
n-gram models of these sequences. In our experi-
ments, we used a 7-gram model, yielding improve-
ments of +0.2/?0.1. We obtained the POS tags using
Brill?s tagger (Brill, 1995).
Next, we considered the problem of unknown in-
put words, which is partly due to hyphenated words,
noun compounds, and morphological variants. Us-
ing the baseline model, 907 words (1.78%) in nc-
test2007 and 262 (0.47%) in test2007 are unknown.
First we separate our hyphens by tokenizing words
such as high-risk into high @-@ risk. This reduces
the number of unknown words to 791/224. Unfor-
tunately, it hurts us in terms of BLEU (?0.1/?0.1).
Second, we split compounds using the frequency-
based method (Koehn and Knight, 2003), reducing
the number of unknown words to than half, 424/94,
improving BLEU on nc-test2007 (+0.5/?0.2).
A final modification to the data preparation is
truecasing. Traditionally, we lowercase all training
and test data, but especially in German, case marks
important distinctions. German nouns are capital-
ized, and keeping case allows us to make the dis-
tinction between, say, the noun Wissen (knowledge)
and the verb wissen (to know). By truecasing, we
only change the case of the first word of a sentence
to its most common form. This method still needs
some refinements, such as the handling of headlines
or all-caps text, but it did improve performance over
the hyphen-tokenized baseline (+0.3/+0.2) and the
original baseline (+0.2/+0.1).
Note that truecasing simplifies the recasing prob-
lem, so a better way to gauge its effect is to look
at the case-sensitive BLEU score. Here the dif-
ference are slightly larger over both the hyphen-
tokenized baseline (+0.6/+0.2) and the original base-

Table 4: Impact of combined modifications for German?
English, measured in BLEU on the development sets
line (+0.4/+0.2). See the Table 2 for details.
As for the other language pairs, using the
monotone-at-punctuation reordering constraint
(+0.3/?0.2) and minimum Bayes risk decoding
(+0.1/?0.1) mostly helps. We also tried bigger
beam sizes (stack size 1000, phrase table limit 50),
but without gains in BLEU (?0.0/?0.1).
Table 3 summarizes the contributions of the indi-
vidual modifications we described above. For our fi-
nal system, we added the improvements one by one
(see Table 4), except for the bigger beam size and
the POS language model. This led to an overall in-
crease of +2.0/+0.8 over the baseline. Due to a bug
in splitting, the system we submitted to the shared
task had a score of only +1.5/+0.6 over the baseline.
4 English?German
For English?German, we applied many of the same
methods as for the inverse language pair. Tok-
enizing out hyphens has questionable impact (?
0.1/+0.1), while truecasing shows minor gains
(?0.0/+0.1), slightly higher for case-sensitive scor-
ing (+0.2/+0.3). We have not yet developed a
method that is the analog of the compound splitting

method ? compound merging. We consider this an
interesting challenge for future work.
While the rich German morphology on the source
side mostly poses sparse data problems, on the tar-
get side it creates the problem of which morpholog-
ical variant to choose. The right selection hinges
on grammatical agreement within noun phrases, the
role that each noun phrase plays in the clause, and
the grammatical nature of the subject of a verb. We
use LoPar (Schmidt and Schulte im Walde, 2000),
which gives us morphological features such as
case, gender, count, although in limited form, it of-
ten opts for more general categories such as not gen-
itive. We include these features in a sequence model,
as we used a sequence model over part-of-speech
tags previously. The gains of this method are espe-
cially strong for the out-of-domain set (+1.1/+0.2).
Minimum Bayes risk decoding (+0.3/?0.0),
themonotone-at-punctuation reordering constraint
(+0.2/?0.1), and bigger beam sizes (+0.1/?0.0)
have similar impact as for the other language pairs.
See Table 5 for a summary of all modifications. By
combining everything except for the bigger beam
size, we obtain overall gains of +1.4/+0.4 over the
baseline. For details, refer to Table 6.
5 Conclusions
We built Moses systems trained on either only Eu-
roparl data or, for Czech and Hungarian, the avail-
able training data. We showed gains with minimum
Bayes risk decoding and a reordering constraint in-
volving punctuation. For German?English, we em-
ployed further language-specific improvements.
