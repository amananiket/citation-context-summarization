Abstract 
It is a challenging task to identify sentiment 
polarity of Chinese reviews because the re-
sources for Chinese sentiment analysis are 
limited. Instead of leveraging only monolin-
gual Chinese knowledge, this study proposes a 
novel approach to leverage reliable English 
resources to improve Chinese sentiment 
analysis. Rather than simply projecting Eng-
lish resources onto Chinese resources, our ap-
proach first translates Chinese reviews into 
English reviews by machine translation ser-
vices, and then identifies the sentiment polar-
ity of English reviews by directly leveraging 
English resources. Furthermore, our approach 
performs sentiment analysis for both Chinese 
reviews and English reviews, and then uses 
ensemble methods to combine the individual 
analysis results. Experimental results on a 
dataset of 886 Chinese product reviews dem-
onstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ap-
proach. The individual analysis of the 
translated English reviews outperforms the in-
dividual analysis of the original Chinese re-
views, and the combination of the individual 
analysis results further improves the perform-
ance.  
1 Introduction 
In recent years, sentiment analysis (including sub-
jective/objective analysis, polarity identification, 
opinion extraction, etc.) has drawn much attention 
in the NLP field. In this study, the objective of sen-
timent analysis is to annotate a given text for polar-
ity orientation (positive/negative). Polarity 
orientation identification has many useful applica-
tions, including opinion summarization (Ku et al, 
2006) and sentiment retrieval (Eguchi and 
Lavrenko, 2006).  
To date, most of the research focuses on English 
and a variety of reliable English resources for sen-
timent analysis are available, including polarity 
lexicon, contextual valence shifters, etc. However, 
the resources for other languages are limited. In 
particular, few reliable resources are available for 
Chinese sentiment analysis1 and it is not a trivial 
task to manually label reliable Chinese sentiment 
resources.  
Instead of using only the limited Chinese knowl-
edge, this study aims to improve Chinese sentiment 
analysis by making full use of bilingual knowledge 
in an unsupervised way, including both Chinese 
resources and English resources. Generally speak-
ing, there are two unsupervised scenarios for ?bor-
rowing? English resources for sentiment analysis 
in other languages: one is to generate resources in 
a new language by leveraging on the resources 
available in English via cross-lingual projections, 
and then perform sentiment analysis in the English 
language based on the generated resources, which 
has been investigated by Mihalcea et al (2007); 
the other is to translate the texts in a new language 
into English texts, and then perform sentiment 
analysis in the English language, which has not yet 
been investigated.  
In this study, we first translate Chinese reviews 
into English reviews by using machine translation 
services, and then identify the sentiment polarity of 
English reviews by directly leveraging English 
resources. Furthermore, ensemble methods are 
employed to combine the individual analysis re-
sults in each language (i.e. Chinese and English) in 
order to obtain improved results. Given machine 
translation services between the selected target 
language and English, the proposed approach can 
be applied to any other languages as well.  
Experiments have been performed on a dataset 
of 886 Chinese product reviews. Two commercial

machine translation services (i.e. Google Translate 
and Yahoo Babel Fish) and a baseline dictionary-
based system are used for translating Chinese re-
views into English reviews. Experimental results 
show that the analysis of English reviews trans-
lated by the commercial translation services out-
performs the analysis of original Chinese reviews. 
Moreover, the analysis performance can be further 
improved by combining the individual analysis 
results in different languages. The results also 
demonstrate that our proposed approach is more 
effective than the approach that leverages gener-
ated Chinese resources. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: 
Section 2 introduces related work. The proposed 
approach is described in detail in Section 3. Sec-
tion 4 shows the experimental results. Lastly we 
conclude this paper in Section 5.  
2 Related Work 
Polarity identification can be performed on word 
level, sentence level or document level. Related 
work for word-level polarity identification includes 
(Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Kim and 
Hovy. 2004; Takamura et al, 2005; Yao et al 
2006; Kaji and Kitsuregawa, 2007), and related 
work for sentence-level polarity identification in-
cludes (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Kim and 
Hovy. 2004) Word-level or sentence-level senti-
ment analysis is not the focus of this paper.   
Generally speaking, document-level polarity 
identification methods can be categorized into un-
supervised and supervised.  
Unsupervised methods involve deriving a senti-
ment metric for text without training corpus.  Tur-
ney (2002) predicates the sentiment orientation of 
a review by the average semantic orientation of the 
phrases in the review that contain adjectives or 
adverbs, which is denoted as the semantic oriented 
method. Kim and Hovy (2004) build three models 
to assign a sentiment category to a given sentence 
by combining the individual sentiments of senti-
ment-bearing words. Hiroshi et al (2004) use the 
technique of deep language analysis for machine 
translation to extract sentiment units in text docu-
ments. Kennedy and Inkpen (2006) determine the 
sentiment of a customer review by counting posi-
tive and negative terms and taking into account 
contextual valence shifters, such as negations and 
intensifiers. Devitt and Ahmad (2007) explore a 
computable metric of positive or negative polarity 
in financial news text.  
Supervised methods consider the sentiment 
analysis task as a classification task and use la-
beled corpus to train the classifier. Since the work 
of Pang et al (2002), various classification models 
and linguistic features have been proposed to im-
prove the classification performance (Pang and Lee, 
2004; Mullen and Collier, 2004; Wilson et al, 
2005a; Read, 2005). Most recently, McDonald et al 
(2007) investigate a structured model for jointly 
classifying the sentiment of text at varying levels 
of granularity. Blitzer et al (2007) investigate do-
main adaptation for sentiment classifiers, focusing 
on online reviews for different types of products. 
Andreevskaia and Bergler (2008) present a new 
system consisting of the ensemble of a corpus-
based classifier and a lexicon-based classifier with 
precision-based vote weighting. 
Research work focusing on Chinese sentiment 
analysis includes (Tsou et al, 2005; Ye et al, 2006; 
Li and Sun, 2007; Wang et al, 2007). Such work 
represents heuristic extensions of the unsupervised 
or supervised methods for English sentiment 
analysis.  
To date, the most closely related work is Mihal-
cea et al (2007), which explores cross-lingual pro-
jections to generate subjectivity analysis resources 
in Romanian by leveraging on the tools and re-
sources available in English. They have investi-
gated two approaches: a lexicon-based approach 
based on Romanian subjectivity lexicon translated 
from English lexicon, and a corpus-based approach 
based on Romanian subjectivity-annotated corpora 
obtained via cross-lingual projections. In this study, 
we focus on unsupervised sentiment polarity iden-
tification and we only investigate the lexicon-based 
approach in the experiments. 
Other related work includes subjective/objective 
analysis (Hatzivassiloglon and Wiebe, 2000; Riloff 
and Wiebe, 2003) and opinion mining and summa-
rization (Liu et al, 2005; Popescu and Etzioni. 
2005; Choi et al, 2006; Ku et al, 2006; Titov and 
McDonald, 2008).  
3 The Proposed Approach 
3.1 Overview 
The motivation of our approach is to make full use 
of bilingual knowledge to improve sentiment 
analysis in a target language, where the resources 
554
for sentiment analysis are limited or unreliable. 
This study focuses on unsupervised polarity identi-
fication of Chinese product reviews by using both 
the rich English knowledge and the limited Chi-
nese knowledge. 
The framework of our approach is illustrated in 
Figure 1. A Chinese review is translated into the 
corresponding English review using machine trans-
lation services, and then the Chinese review and 
the English review are analyzed based on Chinese 
resources and English resources, respectively. The 
analysis results are then combined to obtain more 
accurate results under the assumption that the indi-
vidual sentiment analysis can complement each 
other. Note that in the framework, different ma-
chine translation services can be used to obtain 
different English reviews, and the analysis of Eng-
lish reviews translated by a specific machine trans-
lation service is conducted separately. For 
simplicity, we consider the English reviews trans-
lated by different machine translation services as 
reviews in different languages, despite the fact that 
in essence, they are still in English. 
 
Figure 1. Framework of our approach 
Formally, give a review rev0 in the target lan-
guage (i.e. Chinese), the corresponding review revi  
in the ith language is obtained by using a transla-
tion function:  revi =f iTrans(rev0)? where 1?i?p and  
p is the total number of machine translation ser-
vices. For each review revk in the kth language 
(0?k?p), we employ the semantic oriented ap-
proach to assign a semantic orientation value          
f kSO(revk) to the review, and the polarity orientation 
of the review can be simply predicated based on 
the value by using a threshold. Given a set of se-
mantic orientation values FSO={f kSO(revk) | 0?k?p}, 
the ensemble methods aim to derive a new seman-
tic orientation value )( 0revf EnsembleSO based on the 
values in FSO, which can be used to better classify 
the review as positive or negative.  
The steps of review translation, individual se-
mantic orientation value computation and ensem-
ble combination are described in details in the next 
sections, respectively.  
3.2 Review Translation 
Translation of a Chinese review into an English 
review is the first step of the proposed approach. 
Manual translation is time-consuming and labor-
intensive, and it is not feasible to manually trans-
late a large amount of Chinese product reviews in 
real applications. Fortunately, machine translation 
techniques have been well developed in the NLP 
field, though the translation performance is far 
from satisfactory. A few commercial machine 
translation services can be publicly accessed.  In 
this study, the following two commercial machine 
translation services and one baseline system are 
used to translate Chinese reviews into English re-
views.  
Google Translate 2  (GoogleTrans): Google 
Translate is one of the state-of-the-art commercial 
machine translation systems used today. Google 
Translate applies statistical learning techniques to 
build a translation model based on both monolin-
gual text in the target language and aligned text 
consisting of examples of human translations be-
tween the languages.  
Yahoo Babel Fish 3  (YahooTrans): Different 
from Google Translate, Yaho Babel Fish uses 
SYSTRAN?s rule-based translation engine. 
SYSTRAN was one of the earliest developers of 
machine translation software. SYSTRAN applies 
complex sets of specific rules defined by linguists 
to analyze and then transfer the grammatical struc-
ture of the source language into the target language.  
Baseline Translate (DictTrans): We simply de-
velop a translation method based only on one-to-
one term translation in a large Chinese-to-English

dictionary. Each term in a Chinese review is trans-
lated by the first corresponding term in the Chi-
nese-to-English dictionary, without any other 
processing steps. In this study, we use the 
LDC_CE_DIC2.04 constructed by LDC as the dic-
tionary for translation, which contains 128366 
Chinese terms and their corresponding English 
terms.  
The Chinese-to-English translation perform-
ances of the two commercial systems are deemed 
much better than the weak baseline system. Google 
Translate has achieved very good results on the 
Chinese-to-English translation tracks of NIST open 
machine translation test (MT)5 and it ranks the first 
on most tracks. In the Chinese-to-English task of 
MT2005, the BLEU-4 score of Google Translate is 
0.3531, and the BLEU-4 score of SYSTRAN is 
0.1471. We can deduce that Google Translate is 
better than Yahoo Babel Fish, without considering 
the recent improvements of the two systems.  
Here are two running example of Chinese re-
views and the translated English reviews (Human-
Trans refers to human translation): 
Positive Example: ????,?????? 
HumanTrans: Many advantages and very good shape.  
GoogleTrans: Many advantages, the shape is also very 
good. 
YahooTrans: Merit very many, the contour very is also 
good. 
DictTrans: merit very many figure also very good 
Negative example: ?????????? 
HumanTrans: The memory is too small to support IR. 
GoogleTrans: Memory is too small not to support IR. 
YahooTrans:The memory too is small does not support 
infrared. 
DictTrans: memory highest small negative not to be in 
favor of ir. 
3.3 Individual Semantic Orientation Value 
Computation 
For any specific language, we employ the semantic 
orientated approach (Kennedy and Inkpen, 2006) 
to compute the semantic orientation value of a re-
view. The unsupervised approach is quite  straight-
forward and it makes use of the following 
sentiment lexicons: positive Lexicon (Posi-
tive_Dic) including terms expressing positive po-
larity, Negative Lexicon (Negative_Dic) including 
terms expressing negative polarity, Negation

5 http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/mt/ 
Lexicon (Negation_Dic) including terms that are 
used to reverse the semantic polarity of a particular 
term, and Intensifier Lexicon (Intensifier_Dic) 
including terms that are used to change the degree 
to which a term is positive or negative. In this 
study, we conduct our experiments within two lan-
guages, and we collect and use the following popu-
lar and available Chinese and English sentiment 
lexicons6, without any further filtering and labeling: 
1) Chinese lexicons 
Positive_Diccn: 3730 Chinese positive terms 
were collected from the Chinese Vocabulary for 
Sentiment Analysis (VSA)7 released by HOWNET.  
Negative_Diccn: 3116 Chinese negative terms 
were collected from Chinese Vocabulary for Sen-
timent Analysis (VSA) released by HOWNET. 
Negation_Diccn: 13 negation terms were col-
lected from related papers.  
Intensifier_Diccn: 148 intensifier terms were 
collected from Chinese Vocabulary for Sentiment 
Analysis (VSA) released by HOWNET. 
2) English lexicons  
Positive_Dicen: 2718 English positive terms 
were collected from the feature file subjclueslen1-
HLTEMNLP05.tff 8  containing the subjectivity 
clues used in the work (Wilson et al, 2005a; Wil-
son et al, 2005b). The clues in this file were col-
lected from a number of sources. Some were culled 
from manually developed resources, e.g. general 
inquirer9 (Stone et al, 1966). Others were identi-
fied automatically using both annotated and unan-
notated data. A majority of the clues were 
collected as part of work reported in Riloff and 
Wiebe (2003). 
Negative_Dicen: 4910 English negative terms 
were collected from the same file described above.  
Negation_Dicen: 88 negation terms were col-
lected from the feature file valenceshifters.tff used 
in the work (Wilson et al, 2005a; Wilson et al, 
2005b). 
Intensifier_Dicen: 244 intensifier terms were 
collected from the feature file intensifiers2.tff used 
in the work (Wilson et al, 2005a; Wilson et al, 
2005b). 
                                                          
6 In this study, we focus on using a few popular resources in 
both Chinese and English for comparative study, instead of 
trying to collect and use all available resources.

The semantic orientation value f kSO(revk) for revk 
is computed by summing the polarity values of all 
words in the review, making use of both the word 
polarity defined in the positive and negative lexi-
cons and the contextual valence shifters defined in 
the negation and intensifier lexicons. The algo-
rithm is illustrated in Figure 2. 
Input: a review revk in the kth language. Four lexi-
cons in the kth language: Positive_Dick, Nega-
tive_Dick, Negation_Dick, Intensifier_Dick, which are 
either Chinese or English lexicons; 
Output: Polarity Value f kSO(revk); 
Algorithm Compute_SO: 
1. Tokenize review revk into sentence set S and each 
sentence s?S  is tokenized into word set Ws;  
2. For any word w in a sentence s?S, compute its 
SO value SO(w) as follows: 
1) if w?Positive_Dick , SO(w)=PosValue; 
2) If w?Negative_Dick, SO(w)=NegValue; 
3) Otherwise, SO(w)=0; 
4) Within the window of q words previous to 
w, if there is a term w??Negation_Dick, 
SO(w)= ?SO(w); 
5) Within the window of q words previous to 
w, if there is a term w??Intensifier_Dick, 
SO(w) =??SO(w);

Figure 2. The algorithm for semantic orientation value 
computation 
In the above algorithm, PosValue and Neg-
Value are the polarity values for positive words 
and negative words respectively. We empirically 
set PosValue=1 and NegValue= ?2 because nega-
tive words usually contribute more to the overall 
semantic orientation of the review than positive 
words, according to our empirical analysis. ?>1 
aims to intensify the polarity value and we simply 
set ?=2. q is the parameter controlling the window 
size within which the negation terms and intensi-
fier terms have influence on the polarity words and  
here q is set to 2 words. Note that the above pa-
rameters are tuned only for Chinese sentiment 
analysis, and they are used for sentiment analysis 
in the English language without further tuning. The 
tokenization of Chinese reviews involves Chinese 
word segmentation. 
Usually, if the semantic orientation value of a 
review is less than 0, the review is labeled as nega-
tive, otherwise, the review is labeled as positive.  
3.4 Ensemble Combination 
After obtaining the set of semantic orientation val-
ues FSO={f kSO(revk) | 0?k?p} by using the semantic 
oriented approach, where p is the number of Eng-
lish translations for each Chinese review, we ex-
ploit the following ensemble methods for deriving 
a new semantic orientation value )( 0revf EnsembleSO :

Note that after the new value of a review is ob-

dence in the value.

where ?k?[0, 1] is the weight associated with

two ways: 
Weighting Scheme1: The weight of f kSO(revk) is 
set to the accuracy of the individual analysis in the 
kth language.  
Weighting Scheme2: The weight of f kSO(revk) is 
set to be the maximal correlation coefficient be-
tween the analysis results in the kth language and 
the analysis results in any other language.  The 
underlying idea is that if the analysis results in one 
language are highly consistent with the analysis 
results in another language, the results are deemed 
to be more reliable. Given two lists of semantic 
values for all reviews, we use the Pearson?s corre-
lation coefficient to measure the correlation be-
tween them. The weight associated with function f 
k
SO(revk) is then defined as the maximal Pearson?s 
correlation coefficient between the reviews? values 
in the kth language and the reviews? values in any 
other language.

6) Majority Voting 
This combination method relies on the final po-
larity tags, instead of the semantic orientation val-
ues. A review can obtain p+1 polarity tags based 
on the individual analysis results in the p+1 lan-
guages. The polarity tag receiving more votes is 
chosen as the final polarity tag of the review. 
4 Empirical Evaluation  
4.1 Dataset and Evaluation Metrics 
In order to assess the performance of the proposed 
approach, we collected 1000 product reviews from 
a popular Chinese IT product web site-IT16810 . 
The reviews were posted by users and they focused 
on such products as mp3 players, mobile phones, 
digital camera and laptop computers. Users usually 
selected for each review an icon indicating ?pos-
tive? or ?negative?. The reviews were first catego-
rized into positive and negative classes according 
to the associated icon. The polarity labels for the 
reviews were then checked by subjects. Finally, the 
dataset contained 886 product reviews with accu-
rate polarity labels. All the 886 reviews were used 
as test set.  
We used the standard precision, recall and F-
measure to measure the performance of positive 
and negative class, respectively, and used the Mac-
roF measure and accuracy metric to measure the 
overall performance of the system. The metrics are 
defined the same as in general text categorization. 
4.2 Individual Analysis Results 
In this section, we investigate the following indi-
vidual sentiment analysis results in each specified 
language: 
CN: This method uses only Chinese lexicons 
to analyze Chinese reviews; 
                                                          
10 http://www.it168.com 
GoogleEN: This method uses only English lex-
icons to analyze English reviews translated by 
GoogleTrans; 
YahooEN: This method uses only English lex-
icons to analyze English reviews translated by Ya-
hooTrans; 
DictEN: This method uses only English lexi-
cons to analyze English reviews translated by 
DictTrans;  
In addition to the above methods for using 
English resources, the lexicon-based method inves-
tigated in Mihalcea et al (2007) can also use Eng-
lish resources by directly projecting English 
lexicons into Chinese lexicons. We use a large 
English-to-Chinese dictionary - 
LDC_EC_DIC2.011  with 110834 entries for pro-
jecting English lexicons into Chinese lexicons via 
one-to-one translation. Based on the generated 
Chinese lexicons, two other individual methods are 
investigated in the experiments:  
CN2: This method uses only the generated 
Chinese Resources to analyze Chinese reviews. 
CN3: This method combines the original Chi-
nese lexicons and the generated Chinese lexicons 
and uses the extended lexicons to analyze Chinese 
reviews. 
Table 1 provides the performance values of all 
the above individual methods. Seen from the table, 
the performances of GoogleEN and YahooEN are 
much better than the baseline CN method, and 
even the DictEN performs as well as CN. The re-
sults demonstrate that the use of English resources 
for sentiment analysis of translated English re-
views is an effective way for Chinese sentiment 
analysis. We can also see that the English senti-
ment analysis performance relies positively on the 
translation performance, and GoogleEN performs 
the best while DictEN performs the worst, which 
is consistent with the fact the GoogleTrans is 
deemed the best of the three machine translation 
systems, while DictTrans is the weakest one.  
Furthermore, the CN method outperforms the 
CN2 and CN3 methods, and the CN2 method per-
forms the worst, which shows that the generated 
Chinese lexicons do not give any contributions to 
the performance of Chinese sentiment analysis. We 
explain the results by the fact that the term-based 
one-to-one translation is inaccurate and the gener-
ated Chinese lexicons are not reliable. Overall, the

approach through cross-lingual lexicon translation 
does not work well for Chinese sentiment analysis 
in our experiments. 
4.3 Ensemble Results 
In this section, we first use the simple average en-
semble method to combine different individual 
analysis results. Table 2 provides the performance 
values of the average ensemble results based on 
different individual methods. 
Seen from Tables 1 and 2, almost all of the av-
erage ensembles outperforms the baseline CN 
method and the corresponding individual methods, 
which shows that each individual methods have 
their own evidences for sentiment analysis, and 
thus fusing the evidences together can improve 
performance. For the methods of CN+GoogleEN, 
CN+YahooEN and CN+DictEN, we can see the 
ensemble performance is not positively relying on 
the translation performance: CN+YahooEN per-
forms better than CN+GoogleEN, and even 
CN+DictEN performs as well as CN+GoogleEN. 
The results show that the individual methods in the 
ensembles can complement each other, and even 
the combination of two weak individual methods 
can achieve good performance. However, the Dic-
tEN method is not effective when the ensemble 
methods have already included GoogleEN and 
YahooEN. Overall, the performances of the en-
semble methods rely on the performances of the 
most effective constituent individual methods: the 
methods including both GoogleEN and YahooEN 
perform much better than other methods, and 
CN+GoogleEN+YahooEN performs the best out 
of all the methods.  
  We further show the results of four typical av-
erage ensembles by varying the combination 
weights. The combination weights are respectively 
specified as ??CN+(1-?)?GoogleEN, ??CN+(1-
?)?YahooEN, ??CN+(1-?)?DictEN, 
?1?CN+?2?GoogleEN+(1-?1-?2)?YahooEN.  The results 
over the MacroF metric are shown in Figures 3 and 
4 respectively. We can see from the figures that 
GoogleEN and YahooEN are dominant factors in 
the ensemble methods.  
We then investigate to use other ensemble meth-
ods introduced in Section 3.4 to combine the CN, 
GoogleEN and YahooEN methods. Table 3 gives 
the comparison results. The methods of ?Weighted 
Average1? and ?Weighted Average2? are two 
weighted average ensembles using the two weigh-
ing schemes, respectively. We can see that all the 
ensemble methods outperform the constituent indi-
vidual method, while the two weighted average 
ensembles perform the best. The results further 
demonstrate the good effectiveness of the ensem-
ble combination of individual analysis results for 
Chinese sentiment analysis.

5 Conclusion and Future Work  
This paper proposes a novel approach to use Eng-
lish sentiment resources for Chinese sentiment 
analysis by employing machine translation and 
ensemble techniques. Chinese reviews are trans-
lated into English reviews and the analysis results 
of both Chinese reviews and English reviews are 
combined to improve the overall accuracy. Ex-
perimental results demonstrate the encouraging 
performance of the proposed approach.  
In future work, more additional English re-
sources will be used to further improve the results. 
We will also apply the idea to supervised Chinese 
sentiment analysis.
