Abstract
Many of the tasks required for semantic
tagging of phrases and texts rely on a list
of words annotated with some semantic
features. We present a method for ex-
tracting sentiment-bearing adjectives from
WordNet using the Sentiment Tag Extrac-
tion Program (STEP). We did 58 STEP
runs on unique non-intersecting seed lists
drawn from manually annotated list of
positive and negative adjectives and evalu-
ated the results against other manually an-
notated lists. The 58 runs were then col-
lapsed into a single set of 7, 813 unique
words. For each word we computed a
Net Overlap Score by subtracting the total
number of runs assigning this word a neg-
ative sentiment from the total of the runs
that consider it positive. We demonstrate
that Net Overlap Score can be used as a
measure of the words degree of member-
ship in the fuzzy category of sentiment:
the core adjectives, which had the high-
est Net Overlap scores, were identified
most accurately both by STEP and by hu-
man annotators, while the words on the
periphery of the category had the lowest
scores and were associated with low rates
of inter-annotator agreement.
1 Introduction
Many of the tasks required for effective seman-
tic tagging of phrases and texts rely on a list of
words annotated with some lexical semantic fea-
tures. Traditional approaches to the development
of such lists are based on the implicit assumption
of classical truth-conditional theories of meaning
representation, which regard all members of a cat-
egory as equal: no element is more of a mem-
ber than any other (Edmonds, 1999). In this pa-
per, we challenge the applicability of this assump-
tion to the semantic category of sentiment, which
consists of positive, negative and neutral subcate-
gories, and present a dictionary-based Sentiment
Tag Extraction Program (STEP) that we use to
generate a fuzzy set of English sentiment-bearing
words for the use in sentiment tagging systems 1.
The proposed approach based on the fuzzy logic
(Zadeh, 1987) is used here to assign fuzzy sen-
timent tags to all words in WordNet (Fellbaum,
1998), that is it assigns sentiment tags and a degree
of centrality of the annotated words to the senti-
ment category. This assignment is based on Word-
Net glosses. The implications of this approach for
NLP and linguistic research are discussed.
2 The Category of Sentiment as a Fuzzy
Set
Some semantic categories have clear membership
(e.g., lexical fields (Lehrer, 1974) of color, body
parts or professions), while others are much more
difficult to define. This prompted the development
of approaches that regard the transition frommem-
bership to non-membership in a semantic category
as gradual rather than abrupt (Zadeh, 1987; Rosch,
1978). In this paper we approach the category of
sentiment as one of such fuzzy categories where
some words ? such as good, bad ? are very cen-
tral, prototypical members, while other, less cen-
tral words may be interpreted differently by differ-
ent people. Thus, as annotators proceed from the
core of the category to its periphery, word mem-
1Sentiment tagging is defined here as assigning positive,
negative and neutral labels to words according to the senti-
ment they express.

bership in this category becomes more ambiguous,
and hence, lower inter-annotator agreement can be
expected for more peripheral words. Under the
classical truth-conditional approach the disagree-
ment between annotators is invariably viewed as a
sign of poor reliability of coding and is eliminated
by ?training? annotators to code difficult and am-
biguous cases in some standard way. While this
procedure leads to high levels of inter-annotator
agreement on a list created by a coordinated team
of researchers, the naturally occurring differences
in the interpretation of words located on the pe-
riphery of the category can clearly be seen when
annotations by two independent teams are com-
pared. The Table 1 presents the comparison of GI-
H4 (General Inquirer Harvard IV-4 list, (Stone et
al., 1966)) 2 and HM (from (Hatzivassiloglou and
McKeown, 1997) study) lists of words manually
annotated with sentiment tags by two different re-
search teams.

The approach to sentiment as a category with
fuzzy boundaries suggests that the 21.3% dis-
agreement between the two manually annotated
lists reflects a natural variability in human an-
notators? judgment and that this variability is re-
lated to the degree of centrality and/or relative im-
portance of certain words to the category of sen-
timent. The attempts to address this difference
2The General Inquirer (GI) list used in this study was
manually cleaned to remove duplicate entries for words with
same part of speech and sentiment. Only the Harvard IV-4
list component of the whole GI was used in this study, since
other lists included in GI lack the sentiment annotation. Un-
less otherwise specified, we used the full GI-H4 list including
the Neutral words that were not assigned Positiv or Negativ
annotations.
in importance of various sentiment markers have
crystallized in two main approaches: automatic
assignment of weights based on some statistical
criterion ((Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997;
Turney and Littman, 2002; Kim and Hovy, 2004),
and others) or manual annotation (Subasic and
Huettner, 2001). The statistical approaches usu-
ally employ some quantitative criterion (e.g., mag-
nitude of pointwise mutual information in (Turney
and Littman, 2002), ?goodness-for-fit? measure in
(Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997), probabil-
ity of word?s sentiment given the sentiment if its
synonyms in (Kim and Hovy, 2004), etc.) to de-
fine the strength of the sentiment expressed by a
word or to establish a threshold for the member-
ship in the crisp sets 3 of positive, negative and
neutral words. Both approaches have their limi-
tations: the first approach produces coarse results
and requires large amounts of data to be reliable,
while the second approach is prohibitively expen-
sive in terms of annotator time and runs the risk of
introducing a substantial subjective bias in anno-
tations.
In this paper we seek to develop an approach
for semantic annotation of a fuzzy lexical cate-
gory and apply it to sentiment annotation of all
WordNet words. The sections that follow (1) de-
scribe the proposed approach used to extract sen-
timent information from WordNet entries using
STEP (Semantic Tag Extraction Program) algo-
rithm, (2) discuss the overall performance of STEP
on WordNet glosses, (3) outline the method for
defining centrality of a word to the sentiment cate-
gory, and (4) compare the results of both automatic
(STEP) and manual (HM) sentiment annotations
to the manually-annotated GI-H4 list, which was
used as a gold standard in this experiment. The
comparisons are performed separately for each of
the subsets of GI-H4 that are characterized by a
different distance from the core of the lexical cat-
egory of sentiment.
3 Sentiment Tag Extraction from
WordNet Entries
Word lists for sentiment tagging applications can
be compiled using different methods. Automatic
methods of sentiment annotation at the word level
can be grouped into two major categories: (1)
corpus-based approaches and (2) dictionary-based
3We use the term crisp set to refer to traditional, non-
fuzzy sets
210
approaches. The first group includes methods
that rely on syntactic or co-occurrence patterns
of words in large texts to determine their senti-
ment (e.g., (Turney and Littman, 2002; Hatzivas-
siloglou and McKeown, 1997; Yu and Hatzivas-
siloglou, 2003; Grefenstette et al, 2004) and oth-
ers). The majority of dictionary-based approaches
use WordNet information, especially, synsets and
hierarchies, to acquire sentiment-marked words
(Hu and Liu, 2004; Valitutti et al, 2004; Kim
and Hovy, 2004) or to measure the similarity
between candidate words and sentiment-bearing
words such as good and bad (Kamps et al, 2004).
In this paper, we propose an approach to senti-
ment annotation of WordNet entries that was im-
plemented and tested in the Semantic Tag Extrac-
tion Program (STEP). This approach relies both
on lexical relations (synonymy, antonymy and hy-
ponymy) provided in WordNet and on the Word-
Net glosses. It builds upon the properties of dic-
tionary entries as a special kind of structured text:
such lexicographical texts are built to establish se-
mantic equivalence between the left-hand and the
right-hand parts of the dictionary entry, and there-
fore are designed to match as close as possible the
components of meaning of the word. They have
relatively standard style, grammar and syntactic
structures, which removes a substantial source of
noise common to other types of text, and finally,
they have extensive coverage spanning the entire
lexicon of a natural language.
The STEP algorithm starts with a small set of
seed words of known sentiment value (positive
or negative). This list is augmented during the
first pass by adding synonyms, antonyms and hy-
ponyms of the seed words supplied in WordNet.
This step brings on average a 5-fold increase in
the size of the original list with the accuracy of the
resulting list comparable to manual annotations
(78%, similar to HM vs. GI-H4 accuracy). At the
second pass, the system goes through all WordNet
glosses and identifies the entries that contain in
their definitions the sentiment-bearing words from
the extended seed list and adds these head words
(or rather, lexemes) to the corresponding category
? positive, negative or neutral (the remainder). A
third, clean-up pass is then performed to partially
disambiguate the identified WordNet glosses with
Brill?s part-of-speech tagger (Brill, 1995), which
performs with up to 95% accuracy, and eliminates
errors introduced into the list by part-of-speech
ambiguity of some words acquired in pass 1 and
from the seed list. At this step, we also filter out
all those words that have been assigned contradict-
ing, positive and negative, sentiment values within
the same run.
The performance of STEP was evaluated using
GI-H4 as a gold standard, while the HM list was
used as a source of seed words fed into the sys-
tem. We evaluated the performance of our sys-
tem against the complete list of 1904 adjectives in
GI-H4 that included not only the words that were
marked as Positiv, Negativ, but also those that were
not considered sentiment-laden by GI-H4 annota-
tors, and hence were by default considered neutral
in our evaluation. For the purposes of the evalua-
tion we have partitioned the entire HM list into 58
non-intersecting seed lists of adjectives. The re-
sults of the 58 runs on these non-intersecting seed
lists are presented in Table 2. The Table 2 shows
that the performance of the system exhibits sub-
stantial variability depending on the composition
of the seed list, with accuracy ranging from 47.6%
to 87.5% percent (Mean = 71.2%, Standard Devi-
ation (St.Dev) = 11.0%).

(POS clean-up)
Table 2: Performance statistics on STEP runs.
The significant variability in accuracy of the
runs (Standard Deviation over 10%) is attributable
to the variability in the properties of the seed list
words in these runs. The HM list includes some
sentiment-marked words where not all meanings
are laden with sentiment, but also the words where
some meanings are neutral and even the words
where such neutral meanings are much more fre-
quent than the sentiment-laden ones. The runs
where seed lists included such ambiguous adjec-
tives were labeling a lot of neutral words as sen-
timent marked since such seed words were more
likely to be found in the WordNet glosses in their
more frequent neutral meaning. For example, run
# 53 had in its seed list two ambiguous adjectives
1
dim and plush, which are neutral in most of the
contexts. This resulted in only 52.6% accuracy
(18.6% below the average). Run # 48, on the
other hand, by a sheer chance, had only unam-
biguous sentiment-bearing words in its seed list,
and, thus, performed with a fairly high accuracy
(87.5%, 16.3% above the average).
In order to generate a comprehensive list cov-
ering the entire set of WordNet adjectives, the 58
runs were then collapsed into a single set of unique
words. Since many of the clearly sentiment-laden
adjectives that form the core of the category of
sentiment were identified by STEP in multiple
runs and had, therefore, multiple duplicates in the
list that were counted as one entry in the com-
bined list, the collapsing procedure resulted in
a lower-accuracy (66.5% - when GI-H4 neutrals
were included) but much larger list of English ad-
jectives marked as positive (n = 3, 908) or neg-
ative (n = 3, 905). The remainder of WordNet?s
22, 141 adjectives was not found in any STEP run
and hence was deemed neutral (n = 14, 328).
Overall, the system?s 66.5% accuracy on the
collapsed runs is comparable to the accuracy re-
ported in the literature for other systems run on
large corpora (Turney and Littman, 2002; Hatzi-
vassiloglou and McKeown, 1997). In order to
make a meaningful comparison with the results
reported in (Turney and Littman, 2002), we also
did an evaluation of STEP results on positives and
negatives only (i.e., the neutral adjectives from GI-
H4 list were excluded) and compared our labels to
the remaining 1266 GI-H4 adjectives. The accu-
racy on this subset was 73.4%, which is compara-
ble to the numbers reported by Turney and Littman
(2002) for experimental runs on 3, 596 sentiment-
marked GI words from different parts of speech
using a 2x109 corpus to compute point-wise mu-
tual information between the GI words and 14
manually selected positive and negative paradigm
words (76.06%).
The analysis of STEP system performance
vs. GI-H4 and of the disagreements between man-
ually annotated HM and GI-H4 showed that
the greatest challenge with sentiment tagging of
words lies at the boundary between sentiment-
marked (positive or negative) and sentiment-
neutral words. The 7% performance gain (from
66.5% to 73.4%) associated with the removal of
neutrals from the evaluation set emphasizes the
importance of neutral words as a major source of
sentiment extraction system errors 4. Moreover,
the boundary between sentiment-bearing (positive
or negative) and neutral words in GI-H4 accounts
for 93% of disagreements between the labels as-
signed to adjectives in GI-H4 and HM by two in-
dependent teams of human annotators. The view
taken here is that the vast majority of such inter-
annotator disagreements are not really errors but
a reflection of the natural ambiguity of the words
that are located on the periphery of the sentiment
category.
4 Establishing the degree of word?s
centrality to the semantic category
The approach to sentiment category as a fuzzy
set ascribes the category of sentiment some spe-
cific structural properties. First, as opposed to the
words located on the periphery, more central ele-
ments of the set usually have stronger and more
numerous semantic relations with other category
members 5. Second, the membership of these cen-
tral words in the category is less ambiguous than
the membership of more peripheral words. Thus,
we can estimate the centrality of a word in a given
category in two ways:
1. Through the density of the word?s relation-
ships with other words ? by enumerating its
semantic ties to other words within the field,
and calculating membership scores based on
the number of these ties; and
2. Through the degree of word membership am-
biguity ? by assessing the inter-annotator
agreement on the word membership in this
category.
Lexicographical entries in the dictionaries, such
as WordNet, seek to establish semantic equiva-
lence between the word and its definition and pro-
vide a rich source of human-annotated relation-
ships between the words. By using a bootstrap-
ping system, such as STEP, that follows the links
between the words in WordNet to find similar
words, we can identify the paths connecting mem-
bers of a given semantic category in the dictionary.
With multiple bootstrapping runs on different seed
4It is consistent with the observation by Kim and Hovy
(2004) who noticed that, when positives and neutrals were
collapsed into the same category opposed to negatives, the
agreement between human annotators rose by 12%.
5The operationalizations of centrality derived from the
number of connections between elements can be found in so-
cial network theory (Burt, 1980)
212
lists, we can then produce a measure of the den-
sity of such ties. The ambiguity measure de-
rived from inter-annotator disagreement can then
be used to validate the results obtained from the
density-based method of determining centrality.
In order to produce a centrality measure, we
conducted multiple runs with non-intersecting
seed lists drawn from HM. The lists of words
fetched by STEP on different runs partially over-
lapped, suggesting that the words identified by the
system many times as bearing positive or negative
sentiment are more central to the respective cate-
gories. The number of times the word has been
fetched by STEP runs is reflected in the Gross
Overlap Measure produced by the system. In
some cases, there was a disagreement between dif-
ferent runs on the sentiment assigned to the word.
Such disagreements were addressed by comput-
ing the Net Overlap Scores for each of the found
words: the total number of runs assigning the word
a negative sentiment was subtracted from the to-
tal of the runs that consider it positive. Thus, the
greater the number of runs fetching the word (i.e.,
Gross Overlap) and the greater the agreement be-
tween these runs on the assigned sentiment, the
higher the Net Overlap Score of this word.
The Net Overlap scores obtained for each iden-
tified word were then used to stratify these words
into groups that reflect positive or negative dis-
tance of these words from the zero score. The zero
score was assigned to (a) the WordNet adjectives
that were not identified by STEP as bearing posi-
tive or negative sentiment 6 and to (b) the words
with equal number of positive and negative hits
on several STEP runs. The performance measures
for each of the groups were then computed to al-
low the comparison of STEP and human annotator
performance on the words from the core and from
the periphery of the sentiment category. Thus, for
each of the Net Overlap Score groups, both auto-
matic (STEP) and manual (HM) sentiment annota-
tions were compared to human-annotated GI-H4,
which was used as a gold standard in this experi-
ment.
On 58 runs, the system has identified 3, 908
English adjectives as positive, 3, 905 as nega-
tive, while the remainder (14, 428) of WordNet?s
22, 141 adjectives was deemed neutral. Of these
14, 328 adjectives that STEP runs deemed neutral,
6The seed lists fed into STEP contained positive or neg-
ative, but no neutral words, since HM, which was used as a
source for these seed lists, does not include any neutrals.
Figure 1: Accuracy of word sentiment tagging.
884 were also found in GI-H4 and/or HM lists,
which allowed us to evaluate STEP performance
and HM-GI agreement on the subset of neutrals as
well. The graph in Figure 1 shows the distribution
of adjectives by Net Overlap scores and the aver-
age accuracy/agreement rate for each group.
Figure 1 shows that the greater the Net Over-
lap Score, and hence, the greater the distance of
the word from the neutral subcategory (i.e., from
zero), the more accurate are STEP results and the
greater is the agreement between two teams of hu-
man annotators (HM and GI-H4). On average,
for all categories, including neutrals, the accuracy
of STEP vs. GI-H4 was 66.5%, human-annotated
HM had 78.7% accuracy vs. GI-H4. For the words
with Net Overlap of ?7 and greater, both STEP
and HM had accuracy around 90%. The accu-
racy declined dramatically as Net Overlap scores
approached zero (= Neutrals). In this category,
human-annotated HM showed only 20% agree-
ment with GI-H4, while STEP, which deemed
these words neutral, rather than positive or neg-
ative, performed with 57% accuracy.
These results suggest that the two measures of
word centrality, Net Overlap Score based on mul-
tiple STEP runs and the inter-annotator agreement
(HM vs. GI-H4), are directly related 7. Thus, the
Net Overlap Score can serve as a useful tool in
the identification of core and peripheral members
of a fuzzy lexical category, as well as in predic-

two was 0.68. The Absolute Net Overlap Score on the sub-
groups 0 to 10 was used in calculation of the coefficient of
correlation.

tion of inter-annotator agreement and system per-
formance on a subgroup of words characterized by
a given Net Overlap Score value.
In order to make the Net Overlap Score measure
usable in sentiment tagging of texts and phrases,
the absolute values of this score should be nor-
malized and mapped onto a standard [0, 1] inter-
val. Since the values of the Net Overlap Score
may vary depending on the number of runs used in
the experiment, such mapping eliminates the vari-
ability in the score values introduced with changes
in the number of runs performed. In order to ac-
complish this normalization, we used the value of
the Net Overlap Score as a parameter in the stan-
dard fuzzy membership S-function (Zadeh, 1975;
Zadeh, 1987). This function maps the absolute
values of the Net Overlap Score onto the interval
from 0 to 1, where 0 corresponds to the absence of
membership in the category of sentiment (in our
case, these will be the neutral words) and 1 reflects
the highest degree of membership in this category.
The function can be defined as follows:
S(u;?, ?, ?) =
?
?
?
?
?
?
?
0 for u ? ?
2(u??
???
)2 for? ? u ? ?
1? 2(u??
???
)2 for ? ? u ? ?
1 for u ? ?
where u is the Net Overlap Score for the word
and ?, ?, ? are the three adjustable parameters: ?
is set to 1, ? is set to 15 and ?, which represents a
crossover point, is defined as ? = (? + ?)/2 = 8.
Defined this way, the S-function assigns highest
degree of membership (=1) to words that have the
the Net Overlap Score u ? 15. The accuracy vs.
GI-H4 on this subset is 100%. The accuracy goes
down as the degree of membership decreases and
reaches 59% for values with the lowest degrees of
membership.
5 Discussion and conclusions
This paper contributes to the development of NLP
and semantic tagging systems in several respects.
? The structure of the semantic category of
sentiment. The analysis of the category
of sentiment of English adjectives presented
here suggests that this category is structured
as a fuzzy set: the distance from the core
of the category, as measured by Net Over-
lap scores derived from multiple STEP runs,
is shown to affect both the level of inter-
annotator agreement and the system perfor-
mance vs. human-annotated gold standard.
? The list of sentiment-bearing adjectives. The
list produced and cross-validated by multiple
STEP runs contains 7, 814 positive and neg-
ative English adjectives, with an average ac-
curacy of 66.5%, while the human-annotated
list HM performed at 78.7% accuracy vs.
the gold standard (GI-H4) 8. The remaining
14, 328 adjectives were not identified as sen-
timent marked and therefore were considered
neutral.
The stratification of adjectives by their Net
Overlap Score can serve as an indicator
of their degree of membership in the cate-
gory of (positive/negative) sentiment. Since
low degrees of membership are associated
with greater ambiguity and inter-annotator
disagreement, the Net Overlap Score value
can provide researchers with a set of vol-
ume/accuracy trade-offs. For example, by
including only the adjectives with the Net
Overlap Score of 4 and more, the researcher
can obtain a list of 1, 828 positive and nega-
tive adjectives with accuracy of 81% vs. GI-
H4, or 3, 124 adjectives with 75% accuracy
if the threshold is set at 3. The normalization
of the Net Overlap Score values for the use in
phrase and text-level sentiment tagging sys-
tems was achieved using the fuzzy member-
ship function that we proposed here for the
category of sentiment of English adjectives.
Future work in the direction laid out by this
study will concentrate on two aspects of sys-
tem development. First further incremental
improvements to the precision of the STEP
algorithm will be made to increase the ac-
curacy of sentiment annotation through the
use of adjective-noun combinatorial patterns
within glosses. Second, the resulting list of
adjectives annotated with sentiment and with
the degree of word membership in the cate-
gory (as measured by the Net Overlap Score)
will be used in sentiment tagging of phrases
and texts. This will enable us to compute the
degree of importance of sentiment markers
found in phrases and texts. The availability
8GI-H4 contains 1268 and HM list has 1336 positive and
negative adjectives. The accuracy figures reported here in-
clude the errors produced at the boundary with neutrals.
214
of the information on the degree of central-
ity of words to the category of sentiment may
improve the performance of sentiment deter-
mination systems built to identify the senti-
ment of entire phrases or texts.
? System evaluation considerations. The con-
tribution of this paper to the development
of methodology of system evaluation is two-
fold. First, this research emphasizes the im-
portance of multiple runs on different seed
lists for a more accurate evaluation of senti-
ment tag extraction system performance. We
have shown how significantly the system re-
sults vary, depending on the composition of
the seed list.
Second, due to the high cost of manual an-
notation and other practical considerations,
most bootstrapping and other NLP systems
are evaluated on relatively small manually
annotated gold standards developed for a
given semantic category. The implied as-
sumption is that such a gold standard repre-
sents a random sample drawn from the pop-
ulation of all category members and hence,
system performance observed on this gold
standard can be projected to the whole se-
mantic category. Such extrapolation is not
justified if the category is structured as a lex-
ical field with fuzzy boundaries: in this case
the precision of both machine and human an-
notation is expected to fall when more pe-
ripheral members of the category are pro-
cessed. In this paper, the sentiment-bearing
words identified by the system were stratified
based on their Net Overlap Score and eval-
uated in terms of accuracy of sentiment an-
notation within each stratum. These strata,
derived from Net Overlap scores, reflect the
degree of centrality of a given word to the
semantic category, and, thus, provide greater
assurance that system performance on other
words with the same Net Overlap Score will
be similar to the performance observed on the
intersection of system results with the gold
standard.
? The role of the inter-annotator disagree-
ment. The results of the study presented in
this paper call for reconsideration of the role
of inter-annotator disagreement in the devel-
opment of lists of words manually annotated
with semantic tags. It has been shown here
that the inter-annotator agreement tends to
fall as we proceed from the core of a fuzzy
semantic category to its periphery. There-
fore, the disagreement between the annota-
tors does not necessarily reflect a quality
problem in human annotation, but rather a
structural property of the semantic category.
This suggests that inter-annotator disagree-
ment rates can serve as an important source
of empirical information about the structural
properties of the semantic category and can
help define and validate fuzzy sets of seman-
tic category members for a number of NLP
tasks and applications.
