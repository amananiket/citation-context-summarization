This paper  bu i lds  upon and extends  cer ta in  ideas  
deve loped  w i th in  the  framework of  Genera l i zed  Phrase 
S t ruc ture  Grammar (GPSG). i l l  A new descr ip t ive  
dev ice ,  the  Category  Cooccurrence Rest r i c t ion  (CCR), 
i s  in t roduced  in ana logy  to  ex is t ing  dev ices  of  GPSG 
in order to express constraints on the cooccurrence 
of categories within local trees (i.e. trees of depth 
one) which at present are stated with Immediate 
Dominance (ID) rules and metarules. In addition to 
providing a uniform format for the statement of such 
constraints, CCRs permit generalizations to be 
expressed which presently cannot be captured in GPSG. 
Sections l.l and 1.2 introduce CCRs and presuppose 
only a general familiarity with GPSG. The ideas do 
not depend on details of GPSG and can be applied to 
other grammatical formalisms. 
Sections 1.3 - 1.5 discuss CCRs in relation to 
particular principles of GPSG and ass~ne familiarity 
with Gazdar et al (\].985) (henceforth abbreviated 
'GKPS'). Finally, sect ion  2 conta ins  proposa ls  for  
using CCRs to avoid the ana lyses  with metarules given 
for English in GKPS. 
1. Category  Cooecurrence Rest r i c t ions  (CCRs) 
I,i The Principle of CCRs 
The reasons  fo r  p ropos ing  CCRs to s ta te  
res t r i c t ions  on the  eooccur rence  of ca tegor ies  w i th in  
loca l  t rees  a re  ana logous  to those  for  in t roduc ing  
Inmlediate Dominance (ID) and L inear  Precedence (LP) 
ru les  in GPSG (o f  GEPS, pp. 44-50) .  A context  f ree  
ru le  b inds  in fo rmat ion  of  two sor ts  in a s ing le  
statement, namely 
(a) in fo rmat ion  about which daughters  a rook has 
in  a loca l  t ree  and 
(b) in fo rmat ion  about the  order in  which the 
daughters  appear .  
By separat ing  th i s  in fo rmat ion  in ID and LP ru les ,  
GPSG is able to state generalizations of the sort "A 
preceeds B in every local tree which contains both as 
daughters," which cannot be captured in a context 
f ree  grammar (CFG). 
Now cons ider  an ID ru le  such as the  fo l low ing :  
(i) S --> A, B, C 
The fundmnental motivation for CCRs rests on the 
insight that such an ID rule itself combines two 
different kinds of information in a single statement, 
namely 
(a) information involving immediate dominance 
relations, here that <S, A>~ <S, B>, and 
<S, C> are ordered pairs of categories in 
which the first category inmlediately dominates 
the second and 
(b) information about the cooccurrence of 
categories in a single local tree. 
By distinguishing and separately representing these 
types of information it becomes possible to state 
generalizations of the following sort, which cannot 
be captured in the ID/LP format: 
(2) Any loca l  t ree  w i th  S as i t s  root  must have A as 
a daughter .  
(3) No loca l  t ree  wi th  C as a daughter  a l so  has D as 
a daughter .  
S ta tements  such as (2) and (3) res t r i c t ing  the 
cooccur rence  of ca tegor ies  in loca l  t rees  are  
Category  Cooccurrence Rest r i c t ions ,  which are  
express ions  of f i r s t  a rder  p red icate  log ic  us ing  two 
pr imi t ive  pred icates ,  R(cx, t )  'cx i s  the  root  of loca l  
t ree  t '  and D(~, t )  'a  i s  a daughter  in  loca l  t ree  
t ' .  \[2\] CCRs have the form Vt: ~, where 1T :is a 
schema and the not ion  of a poss ib le  schema i s  de f ined  
as fo l lows :  
(i) (R(a, t)) and (D(~,t)) are of form g; 
(it) if ~ is of form g, then (~)  is of form n; 
(iiJ) if Ip and x are both of form I~, then (~0Kr) 
is of form ~, where K C (A, V, D, e}; 
(iv) constants designating categories occur as 
first arguments within all coastituent 
predicate expressions; 
(v) the same variable t bound by the quantifier 
Vt occurs as second argument within all 
constituent predicate expressions; 
(vi) these are all expressions of form ~. 
Parentheses may be omitted following the usual 
conventions in predicate logic. 
A CCR Vt: u may be rewritten in conjunctive 
normal form as Vt: ~ ^ ... A ~ , where each clause 
ot posltlve and predicate <Pi is a disjunction . . n negated 
expressions, which is equivalent to 
V t: \[p\] ^ ... AVt :  ~ , i.e. a conjunction of simple 
CCRs. -Let 0}, be an e~pression of form n containing

Manfred Pinkal, and Hans Uszkoreit for their

of the BMFT of the German Federal Government. 
\[2\] Interpretations of R(~, t) and D(a, t) in terms 
of the theory of feature instantiation in GKPS 
would be 'the root of local tree t is an 
extension of ~' and 'some daughter in local tree 
t is an extension of ~'.

Quantification is ignored in the notation on the 
r ight ;  ~ rep laces  P (a ,  t) and ~P(~,  t) and ~-~ 
rep laces  ~P(a ,  t )  g iv ing  0o f rom (0 ' ,  where  P = R or  D. 
The spec ia l  b rackets  ' I\[ \]1 ' enc lose  daughters  and 
render the indication of material implication 
superfluous. Using this notation, (2) and (3) may be 
restated as (5) mid (6), respectively:

To re formulate  a set  o f  ID ru les  we thus  need (a)  
the  de f in i t ion  o f  a set  o f  branches  const i tu t ing

1.2 Examples of CCRs 
GKPS (pp .  47-49)  exm,  ines  sets  o f  s imple  context  
f ree  ru les  and  then  proposes  s t rong ly  equ iva lent  
descr ip t ions  in  ID/LP fo rmat .  One set  o f  ID ru les

(7) S -> NP, VP VP -~ V, VP 
S -> AUX, NP, VP VP ~> V, NP 
VP -> AUE, VP VP -> V, NP, VP 
The ID rules of (7) admit local trees whose brancbes 
are among the  following: 
(8)  <S, NP>, <S, VP>, <S, AUX>, 
<VP, V>, <VP, VP>, <VP, AUR>, <VP, NP> 
S ince  none  o f  the l oca l  t rees  admitted by (7)  has  
more  than  one  occur rence  o f  a g iven  category  as  
daughter ,  we may say  that  the  gran~ar  f i r s t  admi ts  
any  s t r i c t ly  l inear ly  o rdered  set  \ [5\]  o f  b ranches

NP, V) ra ther  than  complex  fo r  the  moment,  then  
i t  i s  unnecessary  to  ment ion  more  than  one  root  
category  in a g iven  CCR, 
\[4\] Note that  the  distinction of  permissive vs .  
restrictive statements is closely related to 
that of inherited vs. instontioted feature 
specifications in the feature instantiation 
principles of GPSG. The theory would appear to 
gain in simplicity if a way could be found to 
eliminate these distinctions. 
\[5\] In order to simplify the present exposition, 
that  share  a conmmn mother  as  a loca l  t ree .  Th is  se t  
o f  loca l  t rees  must  then  be  f i l te red  w i th  appropr ia te  
CURs so  as  to  character i ze  the  same set  o f  loca l  
t rees  admi t ted  by  (7 ) .  
A s ing le  CCR covers  the  t rees  w i th  S as  root :  
(9) CCR 1: S \]\[ NP ^ VP \]l 
CUR 1 s ta tes  that  NP and  VP are  ob l igatory  in  any

A " l "  under  a category  (,n the  r ight  s ide  o f  the  table

local tree; "0" means it is absent. If a local tree 
with  the  root  on the  le f t  s ide  o f  the  tab le  and the  
daughters  marked  "1"  in  a g iven  l ine  i s  to  be  
admi t ted  by  the  grarmuar ,  then  a "1"  appears  under  the  
root  category  in  the  cor respond ing  l ine ;  "0"  
ind icates  that  the  t ree  i s  not  admi t ted .  
A cor respond ing  CCR o f  the  fo rm VP I\[('~\]\] can  now 
be fo rmulated ,  where  (0 i s  a Boo lean  express ion  in  
conjunctive normal form. The terms of co are 
constructed from the lines designating inadmissible 
trees as follows: 
(II) ~(AUX A V) iff (~AUX v ~V) lines I, 2, 5, 6 
~(AUX A ~V A NP) iff (~AIJX v V v ~NP) 3 & 7 
~(AUX A ~VP) iff ('~AIIX v VP) 5 - 8 
~(~AUX A ~V) iff (AUX v V) II, 12, 15, 16 
~(~VP A V A ~NP) iff (VP v ~V v NP) \]4 & 16 
The normalized terms of (Ii) are conjoined in the CUR 
of (12), which is reformulated with conditionals in 
(13) and then simplified in (14)'. 
(12)  VP I\[(~AIIX v NV)^ (,-AUXv Vv ~NP) A 
(~AUR v VP) a (AUX v V) ^ (VP v~ V v NP)\]\] 
(13)  VP \[\[(AUX D~V) A (hUX ~ (V v~NP)) ^

than  mul t i se ts  o f  daughters .  
se ts  ra ther

Next, (14) i s  re fo rmulated  as the  three  OORs of  (15),  
which taken  together  w i th  (8) and (9) admit  the  same 
set  of  loca l  t rees  as the  ID ru les  o f  (7) :  
(15) CCR 2: VP \[\[ AUg ~ ~V \]J 
CCR 3: VP I\[ AUg ~ (VP ^ ~P) )  \]t 
CCR 4: VP \[\[ V D (VP v NP) \]\[ 
The CCRs of  (15) have been fo rmulated  on ly  on the  
bas i s  of  VP t rees ,  however, and there fore  fa i l  to  
capture  genera l i za t ions  that  app ly  to a l l  l oca l  
t rees .  In par t i cu la r ,  any loca l  t ree  w i th  AUX as 
daughter  - regard less  of i t s  root  - must have a VP as 
sister, so CCR 3 may be restated as two simpler CCRs, 
CCR 2' and CCR 4', where CCR 2' does not depend on 
the root category. Furthermore, CCR 4 can be 
rewritten as CCR 5' since V cannot be a daughter of 
S. The following final set of CCRs thus emerges: 
(16) COR I': S \]\[ NP A VP \]\] 
CCR 2': \]\[ AUX ~ VP \]\[ 
CCR 3': VP \]\[ AUX e ~Y \]\] 
CCR 4 ' :  VP l\[ AU? D,--NP \]l 
CCR 5 ' :  \]\[ V m (VP v NP) \]\] 
It may first appear that the description with CCRs 
in  (8) and (16) const i tu tes  no c lear  ga in  over  the  ID 
ru les  of  (7) .  The la t te r ,  however, are  h igh ly  
redundant  and express  none of  the  genera l i za t ions  
ach ieved  in (16).  Furthermore,  the rep lacement  of  ID 
ru les  w i th  CCRs i s  the  essent ia l  p rerequ is i te  fo r  the  
elimination of metarules described in section 2. 
\].3 The Complement-Type Principle 
The ~ttempt to replace all ID rules with 
individual CCRs would lead to very complicated 
descriptions. Fortunately, the idea of CCRs can be 
utilized in a general principle that replaces all 
.lexJca\] ID rules (i.e. those which have a head that 
is an extension of a SUBCAT category; cf GKPS, p. 
54), so that only nonleA'ical ID rules need be 
explicitly reformulated with individual CCRs. 
Shieber (1983) and Pollard (1985) have proposed 
that a list- or stack-valued feature (SYNCAT or 
SUBCAT) be introduced whose value contains the 
complements of a head category. This paper uses TYP 
as a syntactic feature with a semantically oriented 
and lexJcally determined semantic type as its value. 
Following the convention of GKPS (p. 189), '<~, B>' 
will be written for <TYP(~), TYP(~)> where ~ and 
are categories. Given the structure of complex types 
in GKPS as single-valued functions, the types may be 
viewed as lists or stacks. 
A Complement-Type Principle (CTP) can now be 
stated which has the form of a schematic CCR with 
conditions on variables: 
( \ ]7) (a)\]IX\[BAR 0, +H, TYP 
<6 I, <...<Sn_ l, 5n>...>>\] \]1 X\[TYP 5n\] 
(b) \[IX\[BAR 0, +H, TYP <61, <...<6n_l, 6n>...>> \] 
X\[TYP 51\] ^... ^X\[TYP 5n_l\]^ ~X\[TYP 6'\] \]I 
where 
(i) 5' ~ {61 .... .  5n_ l} ; 
( i t )  the  mother X\[TYP 6n\] and head daughter  
X\[BAR 0, +HI a re  both  ~\[CONJ\] ; \[6\] 
( i i i )  (a) and (b) a re  s imu l taneous ly  fu l f i l l ed  
fo r  a g iven  ass ignment  of  types  to  51, 
. . . .  5n_ l ,  6 n fo r  1 < n. 
CTP a l lows  the complements of  a head category  to be 
read o f f  from i t s  semant ic  type  i f  i t s  mother i s  
known. According to CTP the  lex ica l  head category  
V\[SUBCAT 46\] with type <VP\[-AUX, BSE\], <NP, S>> for 
the verb do has complement sisters VP\[-AUX, BSE\] 
and NP if its mother is S but has just the complement 
VP\[-AUX, BSE\] if its mother is VP, which has the type 
<NP, S>. The use of CTP in dealing with metarules 
will be shown in section 2 below, but first another 
general aspect of the metarule problem must be 
discussed. 
1.4 Metaru \ ]es  and Lex ica l  Rules  
GKPS in t roduces  not on ly  metaru les ,  e .g .  the  
Pass ive  Metaru le  (p. 59) and the Ext rapos i t ion  
Metaru le  (p. 118), but  a l so  re la ted  lex ica l  ru les  
invo lv ing  the  same phenomena, e .g .  the  Lex iea l  Rule 
for  Pass ive  Forms (p. 219) and the Lex ica l  Rule fo r  
Ext rapos i t ion  Verbs (p. 222).  The lex Jea l  ru les  a re  
not fu l l y  fo rmal i zed  but a l l  s ta te  rough ly  that  i f  a 
g iven  lexeme has a cer ta in  category ,  t rans la t ion ,  and 
semant ic  type,  then a par t i cu la r  form of  the  lexeme 
has a cor respond ing  category ,  t rans la t ion ,  and type .  
S ince lex iea l  ru les  do most of  the work, and g iven  
that  metaru les  app ly  on ly  to  Je_vSeaJ ID ru les ,  i t  
i s  unc lear  why both  shou ld  be needed for  what i s  
essent ia l l y  one job.  \[7\] 
CTP in fac t  a l lows  the reduct ion  of  both  dev ices ,  
metaru les  and lex ica l  ru les ,  to  one, here  termed 
'meta lex ica l '  (ML) ru les .  The  la t te r  a re  schemat ic  
ru les  of the  form s =& ~, where a and 8 a re  category  
schemata which may conta in  var iab les  in  feature  
va lues .  Ignor ing  the  semant ic  t rans la t ions  o f  
lexemes fo r  the  present ,  a ML ru le  s ta tes  that  i f  the  
lex icon  con?a ins  an ent ry  ass ign ing  ~ to  lexeme w, 
then i t  a l so  conta ins  an ent ry  ass ign ing  ~ to w; 
morpho log ica l  ru les  determine  the  par t i cu la r  word 
form of w on the bas i s  of  syntact i c  features  in  the  
category .  ML ru les  thus  prov ide  fo r  an induct ive  
de f in i t ion  of the  lex icon .  They hand le  not on ly  
phenomena l i ke  pass ive  and ext rapos J t ion  but  a l so ,  
e .g .  the  subcategor i za t ion  of  sdng with  or w i thout  
an ind i rec t  object: ,  t rans i t i ve  or in t rans i t i ve ,  e tc .  
Examples fo l low in sect ion  2, but  next  the ent i re  
formal i sm shou ld  be br ie f ly  summarized. 
\[6\] The res t r i c t ion  that  both  categor ies  be ~\[CONJ\] 
( i .e .  unspec i f ied  fo r  CONJ) i s  necessary  fo r  
coord inat ion .  In the  s t ruc tura l  ana lys i s  of 
bought and read books NP is the complement of 
the V dominating bought and read but not of the 
V dominating read. 
\[7\] Uszkore i t  (1984, p. 65) has a l ready  expressed  a 
similar view.

1.5 Sunmlary of  the  Formal ism 
The syntact i c  fo rmal i sm proposed here  proceeds  by 
descr ib ing  i tems ( feature  names and va lues ,  feature  
spec i f i ca t ions ,  ca tegor ies ,  and t rees )  w i th  
s ta tements  res t r i c t ing  the  d i s t r ibut ion  of  lower -  
leve l  i tems w i th in  next -h igher - leve l  i tems.  Feature  
nantes and atomic  va lues  are  pr imi t ives .  Complex 
feature  va lues  a re  categor ies  or semant ic  types .  A 
feature  spec i f i ca t ion  i s  an ordered  pa i r  <f, v> 
conta in ing  a feature  nmne f and va lue  v, where the 
la t te r  i s  res t r i c ted  by the  feature -va lue  rmlge of 
the  former,  h category  i s  a se t  of  feature  
spec i f i ca t ions  such that  no feature  name i s  ass igned  
more than one va lue ;  i t  i s  lega l  i f f  i t  fu l f i l l s  a l l  
Feature  Cooccurrence Rest r i c t ions .  h loca l  t ree  i s  an 
ordered  pa i r  cons is t ing  of  a lega l  root  ca tegory  and 
a l i s t  of  lega l  daughter  categor ies  such that  (a) the  
Complmnent-Type Pr inc ip le ,  (b) t i le Category  
Cooecurrence Rest r i c t ions ,  and (c) t i le Feature  
Ins tml t ia t ion  P r inc ip les  ( i .e . ,  respect ive ly ,  
lex ica l ,  non lex ica l ,  and un iversa l  s ta tements  in  the 
form of  CCRs) as well as tile Linear Precedence 
statements are fulfilled. \[8\] A tree is an ordered 
pair consisting of a legal root category and a list 
of daughters, where each dau~,ter is either a tree or 
a word form. Word forms and their lexieal categories 
are specified by tile lexicon, defined by a list of 
basic lexical entries and metalexical rules. 
The gramlmar defines two binary relations over 
categories, ID and LP (the latter constitutiag the 
Linear Precedence statements). A binary relation R ~ 
is the extensional closure of R iff for each <~, g> 
in  R, R ~ ton i : s ins  every  <y, 6> such that  y and 6 are  
extensions (oF GKPS, p. 27) of ~ and 6, respectively. 
A local tree with root C and daughters C~, ..., C 
? . . o  ~ n must fulfill him condltlons that <C , C.~ E ID= for  
1 < i < n and <C., C.> ~ LP E+ ( i .e?  t~e t rans i t i ve  %- 1 . ex tens iona l  e lo~ure  of  LP) where 1 < 1 < n-1 and 
j = i+ l .  
The proposed formal i sm ut i l i zes  more res t r i c ted  
memm tilmt GPSG but  o f fe rs  g reater  poss ib i l i t i es  for  
express ing  genera l i za t ions .  The el  im inat  :ion of 
metaru les  and the in t roduct ion  of CCRs g ive  i t  a taore 
Ii~uogeneous s t ruc t :a re  and place cooccur rence  
res t r i c t ions  of  var ious  k inds  in the  center  of 
attention. 
For the present it may be best to regard this 
formalism as a particular variant of GPSG since most 
of tile central notions of the latter are retained. 
All that is sought is a simplification of GPSG as 
described in GKPS. Given the ricll palette of 
formal.tams recently proposed for kinds of unification 
gra~mlar~ it seems rather ingenuous to create a new 
name for thin modification of GPSG, as though tile 
multitude of remaining open questions were thereby 
answered. What we need is a metaformalism that will 
relate the insights of all the current formalisms 
through formal invariants preserved under translation 
from one formalism to another, and that will then 
truly deserve a name of its own. 
\[8\] The assmnpt ion  here  i s  that  any work done by t i le 
Feature  Spec i f i ca t ion  Defau l t s  (FSDs) of  GKPS can 
be accomplished with suitably defined FCRs and 
CC~s. This will he illustrated in section 2 hut 
cannot be shown in general in this paper. 
2. The E l iminat ion  of Metaru les  
2.1 Genera l  Remarks 
GKPS a l lows  metaru les  to  be used in ways that  
in tu i t i ve ly  seem undes i rab le .  For example, a metaru le  
may s imply  ind icate  that. a daughter  h of S i s  
opt iona l  :
( lS )  ( s -> w, h ) -~ ( s - -~  w ) 
The metarule is superfluous if A is enclesed in

Aside from the use of parentheses to indicate 
single optional elements, none of tile ahhreviatory 
convent ions  proposed in Chomsky/Hal \]e ( 1968, pp. 
393-399) are enlployed in GPS(\]. Thus, the ru les  of 
(19) cannot be abbrev ia ted  w i th  braces  as in (23): 
(23) s -> (A) ,  B, (

2.2 The Passive Metarule 
GKP8 (p. 59) p resents  a Pass ive  Metarule (PM) of  
remarkable s impl i c i ty  and genera l i ty :  
(24) VP --> W, NP 
VP\ [PAS\ ]  -@ W, (PP\[by\]) 
PM s ta tes  that  fo r  every lex ica l  ID ru le  expanding VP 
and conta in ing  NP and any mul t i se t  W of categor ies  in 
the RHS, there  is  a cor respond ing lex ica l  ID ru le  
expanding VP\[PAS\] and opt iona l ly  conta in ing  PP\[by\] in 
p lace of  NP in i t s  RHS. Although the head V dominated 
by VP\[PAS\] is not mentioned in PM, it must be 
specified <VFOEN~ PAS> in a local tree by virtue of 
the Head Feature Convention. 
As noted in section 1.4, however, PM does only a 
small part of the work for passive, the main task 
"falling to the Lexical Rule for Passive Forms. 
Moreover, some of the predictions of PM are 
incorrect. Thus, PM applies to the lexical ID rule 
introducing V\[SUBCAT 20\], to which bother belongs: 
(25) VP\[AGR S\] --> HI20\] ,  NP 
But the derived ID rule for V\[20, PAS\] incorrectly 
al lows a PP\[PFORM by\] complement. \[10\] Furthermore,  
sentences l ike That Santa Claus exists . is believed 
by Kim. are grammatical ,  but PM does not: apply to 
the lex ica l  ID ru le  in t roduc ing  V\[SUBCAT 40\] fo r  
beldt:.ve : 
(26) VP --> H\[40\], S\[FIN\] 
Let PAS be a Boolean-valued feature restricted to 
\[+V, -N\] categories. Then we may state the following 
Metalexical Rule for Passive Forms: 
(27) V\[-PAS, AGR 6n, TYP <61,<. . .<6n_ l ,<6n,S>>. . .>>l  
g 
V\[+PAS, AGR 6n_l, TYP <6~I,<61,<...<6n_i,S>...>>> \] 
and 
V\[+PAS, AGR 6n_\], TYP 461,<...<6n_\],S>...>> \] 
where 
( i )  6 n-l' 6 n 6 {NP, S} and 
( i i )  :if 6 = NP then 6' : PP\[by\] e l se  6' = S. 
n n n 
Note that  6 , and 6 are the categor ies  of  the 
- -1  . n direct, object! and sub jec t  of  V\[-PAS\], respect ive ly .  
By CTP V\[-PAS\] with mother VP (of  type <6 , S>) has 
complements 6 , . . . .  6 , whi le V\[+PAS\] n i th  mother 
VP (of type <~ ,, S>) hnsleomplements 6 . . . . .  , 6 
n-  t , l n -z  and, opt*ona l ly ,  6 n. 
\[I0\] V\[PAS\] is specified <SUBCAT, 2> in ,h~n was 
bothered ~Y his boss. 
2.3 The 'Subject-Aux Inversion' (SAI) Metarule 
The second metarule for English discussed in GEPS 
is the 'Subjeet-Aux Inversion' (SAI) Metarule (pp. 
60-65): 
(28) V2\[-SUBJ\] "--> W 
V2\[+INV, +SUBJ\] --~ W, NP 
This applies to all lexical ID rules expanding VP. 
\[II\] Because of (29), however, local trees are 
admitted only by derived IB rules produced by its 
application to base lexical ID rules expanding 
categories specified VP\[+AUX\]: 
(29) \[+INV\] = \[+AUX, FIN\] (FCR 1) 
Most of  the work of  th i s  metaru\]e can be taken 
care of  s imply by the CTP s ince  a lex ica l  head Y wi th  
the type <6 I, <...<6n, <hiP, S>>...>> has the 
complements 61, ..., 6 if its mother is VP (of type 
<NP, S>) and {he complements &l' '''' 6n, NP if the 
mother is S. Further restrictions must determine when 
V has which mother. In addition to the FCRs of (29) 
and (30), retained from GKPS, the new FCR of (31) is 
introduced: 
(30) \[+INV, BAR 2\] D \[+SUBJ\] (FCR I0) 
(31) \[INV\] ~ \[+V, -N\] 
INV is a HEAD feature subject to the Head Feature 
Convention (cf GKPS, pp. 94-99), so a V 2 mother of 
V\[+INVJ must be specified <INV, +> and therefore also 
<SUBJ, +>. If V is specified <INV, -> (note that (31) 
requires it to have some specification for INV), then 
its mother is *lot an extension of V 2 (providing for 
coordination) or it is specified <SUBJ, -> according 
to the following CCR: 
(32) I\[ V\[-INV\] 31 (~V 2 v \[-SUBJ\]) \[12\] 
Although GKPS provides fo r  ,an embedded inver ted  
sentence in What d Jd  you  see?  , no embedded nonhead 
S is specified <INV, +>. This fact is captured with 
a CCR: 
(33) (\[ ~S\[-H, +INV\] \]1 
A spec ia l  Feature Spec i f i ca t ion  Defaul t  to account 
for the distribution of INY (c f  CKPS, pp. 30-31) then 
becomes unnecessary. 
\ [ l l \ ]  
\[12\] 
Recal l  the use of a l iases  in GKPS (p. 61) 
whereby 'VP' s tands  for  V2\[-SUBJ\] and 'S '  fo r  
V2\[+SUBJ\]. 
Note that  th i s  CCR conta ins  a d i s junct ion  of  
root  descr ip t ions  and thus does not conform to 
the schemata for simple CCRs with atomic 
categories presented in section 1.1 above. The 
disjunction is to he read "the root is not an 
extension of V 2 or it is an extension of 
\[-SUBJ\]."

2.4 The Ext rapos i t ion  Metaru le  
GKPS (p. 118) proposes the following metarule to 
handle extraposit ion: 
(34) X2\[AGR S\] --> W 
# 
X2\[AaR NP\[it\]\] --> W, S 
The metarule correctly predicts sentences like . It 
bothers  John that Kint drinks, because it applies to 
the lexical IB rule introducing V\[SUBCAT 20\] for 
bother  : 
(35) W\ [A(m S\] --> II\[ZO\], Nr 
To allow It" is s_lppa, rent  that K im drinks. , however-, 
it must also apply to the icxical IB rule introducing 
A\[SUBCAT 25\] for apparent  : 
(36) Al\[AGll S\] -) H\[25\],  (PP\[PFORM to\]) 
Both case;~ can he covered with CTP if the Lexical 
Rule for" Ext rapos i t ion  Verbs of  GKPS (p. 222) i s  
rep laced  wit:h the  fo l low ing  meta lex iea l  ru le :  
(37) \[+Y, BAll O, AGR S, TYP <61,<...<6n,<S,S>>...>>\] 
\[+V, BAR 0, AGR NP\[iL\], 
TYP <61,<...<6n,<S,<NP\[it\],S>>>...>>\] 
The Ext rapos i t ion  Metarul  e of  GKPS i s  then 
super f luous .  
2.5 S lash  T,~rmination Metaru les  
S lash  Terminat ion  Metaru\ ]e  1 (STM1) (of  GKPS, pp. 
142-1.44) i s  of  par t i cu la r  in teres t  because of i t s  
genera l i ty :  
(38) X -> W, X 2 
1~ 2 
X --> W, X \[+NULI,\] 
It applies to any \ ]ex ica l  ID ru le  with a category  
spec i f ied  <tIAR, 2> in the  RItS and produces a ru le  
with the spec i f i ca t ion  <NULL, +> added to this 
category. 
It turns out that S'1%1\] lnay be eliminated with two 
simple statements. An FCR expresses the fact that a 
category is ~pecified for NUI,L (i.e. NULL takes the 
value + or -) if and only if it also is <BAR, 2>: 
(39) \[NULLI -= \[BAR 2\] 
A CCR then stipulates that a category specified 
<NULL, +> mu'4t have a lexical category as its sister 
in a local tree: 
.(40) It \[+NULL\] m \[BAR 0\] \]1 
This i s  equ iva lent  to  the cond i t ion  that  STN1 - l i ke  
a l l  metarule:~ - may on ly  app ly  to lex ica l  IB ru les .  
Note that  a root  category  i s  not ind icated  in (40) 
and that  paras i t i c  gaps (o f  GKPS, pp. 162 i f )  are 
prov ided  fo r .  
As in GKPS, an FCR requ i res  that a category  
specified <NUI,L, +> also be specified for SLASH: 
(41) \[+NULL\] ~ \[SLASH\] (FCR 19) 
The d is t r ibut ion  of  SI,AStI i s  in tu rn  governed by the 
CAP, HFC, and FFP. GKPS a l so  postu la tes  an FSD fo r  
NULl, : 
(42) ~\[NULL\] (FSD 3) 
FgD 3 is not required in tills analysis since 
categories specified <BAR, 2> are freely specified 
with values from (4, -} for NULl,, while all other 
categories must he unspecified for NULL according to 
(39).  
The t reatment  of gaps in  GKPS i s  completed wi th  
the S lash  Terminat ion  Metaru le  2 (STM2) (c f  GKPS, pp. 
160:162) : 
(43) X --> W, V2\[+SUBJ, FIN\] 
X/NP -> W, vP\[-sUBJ\] 
S~'M2 says that for every \]exical ID rule introducing 
V ~ \[+SUB J, FIN\] as a daughter, there is a 
corresponding rule with V2\[-SUBJ, FIN\] in place of 
V 2\[~SUBJ, FIN\] and with the mother specified 
<SLASI{, NP>. 
Examinat ion  of  the  lex ica l  \]D ru les  proposed for  
Eng l i sh  in GKI)S revea ls  that  a l l  @\[FIN\] daughters  
in t roduced  are  a l so  spec i f ied  <SUB J, +>. We may 
there fore  re fo rmulate  t im types  of  the \ ]ex ica l  head 
cat .egor ies  o that  V 2\[FIN\] complements do not car ry  
the spec i f i ca t ion  <SUBJ, +>. The feature  SUBJ i s  then 
f ree ly  spec i f ied  but res t r i c ted  by the FCR in (44) 
and the CCR in (45):  
(44) \[SUBJ\] r~ \[-~V, -N, lIAR 2\] 
(/15) 1\[ \[BAR 0\] ^  V 2 \[-SI, JI'IJ, FIN\] \]1 X/NP 
The CCR of  (4.5) s ta tes  that  a loca l  t ree  w i th  
V2\[-SUBJ, FIN\] and \[BAit O\] as daughters  must have a 
root  spec i f ied  <SLASII, NP>. As :in the case of STM\],

counterpar t  of the  requ i rement  hat  metaru \ ]es  apply

Taken together ,  the  two FCRs of  (39) and (44) p lus  
the two CCRs of  (40) and (45) accompl i sh  a l l  the work 
of STM1 and STM2 and resu l t  in the same ana lyses  for
