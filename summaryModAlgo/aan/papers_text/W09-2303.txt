Abstract
The empirical adequacy of synchronous
context-free grammars of rank two (2-SCFGs)
(Satta and Peserico, 2005), used in syntax-
based machine translation systems such as
Wu (1997), Zhang et al (2006) and Chi-
ang (2007), in terms of what alignments they
induce, has been discussed in Wu (1997) and
Wellington et al (2006), but with a one-sided
focus on so-called ?inside-out alignments?.
Other alignment configurations that cannot be
induced by 2-SCFGs are identified in this pa-
per, and their frequencies across a wide col-
lection of hand-aligned parallel corpora are
examined. Empirical lower bounds on two
measures of alignment error rate, i.e. the one
introduced in Och and Ney (2000) and one
where only complete translation units are con-
sidered, are derived for 2-SCFGs and related
formalisms.
1 Introduction
Syntax-based approaches to machine translation
typically use synchronous grammars to recognize or
produce translation equivalents. The synchronous

production rules are typically learned from align-
ment structures (Wu, 1997; Zhang and Gildea, 2004;
Chiang, 2007) or from alignment structures and
derivation trees for the source string (Yamada and
Knight, 2001; Zhang and Gildea, 2004). They are
also used for inducing alignments (Wu, 1997; Zhang
and Gildea, 2004).
It is for all three reasons, i.e. translation, in-
duction from alignment structures and induction of
alignment structures, important that the synchronous
grammars are expressive enough to induce all the
alignment structures found in hand-aligned gold
standard parallel corpora (Wellington et al, 2006).
Such alignments are supposed to reflect the structure
of translations, typically contain fewer errors and are
used to evaluate automatically induced alignments.
In this paper it is shown that the synchronous
grammars used in Wu (1997), Zhang et al (2006)
and Chiang (2007) are not expressive enough to do
that. The synchronous grammars used in these sys-
tems are, formally, synchronous context-free gram-
mars of rank two (2-SCFGs), or equivalently (nor-
mal form) inversion transduction grammars (ITGs).1
The notion of rank is defined as the maximum num-
ber of constituents aligned by a production rule,
i.e. the maximum number of distinct indeces. Our
results will be extended to slight extensions of 2-
SCFGs, incl. the extension of ITGs proposed by
Zens and Ney (2003) (xITGs), synchronous tree
substitution grammars of rank two (2-STSGs) (Eis-
ner, 2003; Shieber, 2007), i.e. where tree pairs in-
clude at most two linked pairs of nonterminals, and
synchronous tree-adjoining grammars of rank two
12-SCFGs allow distinct LHS nonterminals, while ITGs do
not; but for any 2-SCFG an equivalent ITG can be constructed
by creating a cross-product of nonterminals from two sides.
19
(2-STAGs) (Shieber and Schabes, 1990; Harbusch
and Poller, 1996; Nesson et al, 2008). The over-
all frequency of alignment structures that cannot
be induced by these approaches is examined across
a wide collection of hand-aligned parallel corpora.
Empirical lower bounds on the coverage of the sys-
tems are derived from our results.
Our notion of an alignment structure is standard.
Words can be aligned to multiple words. Unaligned
nodes are permitted. Maximally connected sub-
graphs are called translation units. There is one
more choice to make in the context of many-to-many
alignments, namely whether the alignment relation
is such that if wi|w?k and wi|w?l, resp., are aligned,
and wj |w?k are aligned too, then wj |w?l are also
aligned. If so, the alignment structure is divided into
complete translation units. Such alignment struc-
tures are therefore called complete; in Goutte et
al. (2004), alignment structures with this property
are said to be closed under transitivity. An align-
ment structure is simply written as a sequence of
alignments, e.g. ?wi|w?k, wi|w?l, wj |w?k, wj |w?k?, or,
alternatively, as sequences of (possibly discontinu-
ous) translation units, e.g. ?wiwj|w?kw?l?.
A translation unit induced by a synchronous
grammar is a set of terminals that are recognized
or generated simultaneously. Consequently, syn-
chronous grammars can only induce complete align-
ment structures (by transitivity of simultaneity).2
Syntax-based approaches to machine translations
are commonly evaluated in terms of their alignment
error rate (AER) on one or more parallel corpora
(Och and Ney, 2000; Zhang and Gildea, 2004). The
AER, in the case where all alignments are sure align-
ments, is
AER = 1? 2|SA ?GA||SA| + |GA|
where GA are the gold standard alignments, and SA
the alignments produced by the system.
AER has been criticized by Fraser and
Marcu (2007). They show that AER does not
penalize unequal precision and recall when a
distinction between sure and possible alignments is
2One of the hand-aligned parallel corpora used in our exper-
iments, the one also used in Pado? and Lapata (2006), includes
incomplete alignment structures.
made. Since no such distinction is assumed below,
the classical definition is used.
We introduce also the notion of translation unit
error rate (TUER), which is defined as
TUER = 1 ? 2|SU ?GU ||SU |+ |GU |
where GU are the translation units in the gold stan-
dard, and SU the translation units produced by the
system. In other words, what is measured is a sys-
tem?s ability to predict translation units relative to
the Gold standard, not just its ability to predict align-
ments. If the system only gets part of a translation
unit right, it is not rewarded.
In the context of many-to-many alignments, this
measure may tell us more about translation quality
than AER. Consider, for instance, the small chil-
dren?s book discourse in Danish:

?Mette often asks: Do you want to add together??
Say (1-4) and the English translations are a par-
allel corpus on which we would like to evaluate an
aligner or a statistical machine translation system.
Say also that the test corpus has been aligned. Let
the first three sentences be our training data and (4)
our test data.
20
Note that the words l?gger . . . sammen form a dis-
continuous translation unit (?add?). Say our aligner
aligned only sammen and add, but not l?gger and
add. This would mean that the alignments or trans-
lations of add would most likely be associated with
the following probabilities:
.66 (add, sammen)
.33 (add, addere)
which again means that our system is likely to
arrive at the wrong alignment or translation in (4).
Nevertheless these alignments are rewarded in AER.
TUER, on the other hand, reflects the intuition that
unless you get the entire translation unit it?s better to
get nothing at all.
The hand-aligned parallel corpora in our exper-
iments come from the Copenhagen Dependency
Treebank (Buch-Kromann, 2007), for five different
language pairs, the German-English parallel corpus
used in Pado? and Lapata (2006), and the six par-
allel corpora of the first 100 sentences of Europarl
(Koehn, 2005) for different language pairs docu-
mented in Graca et al (2008). Consequently, our
experiments include a total of 12 parallel corpora.
The biggest parallel corpus consists of 4,729 sen-
tence pairs; the smallest of 61 sentence pairs. The
average size is 541 sentence pairs. The six paral-
lel corpora documented in Graca et al (2008) use
sure and possible alignments; in our experiments, as
already mentioned, the two types of alignments are
treated alike.3
3The annotations of the parallel corpora differ in format and
consistency. In fact the empirical lower bounds obtained be-
low are lower bounds in two senses: (i) they are lower bounds
on TUERs because TUERs may be significantly higher than
the empirical lower bounds found here, and (ii) they are lower
bounds in the sense that there may be hidden instances of the
configurations in question in the parallel corpora. Most seri-
ously, our search algorithms only sort alignments, but not their
elements; instead they assume that their elements are listed in
chronological order. Sometimes, but rarely, this is not the case.
Consider, for instance, file 1497, line 12 in the Danish?Spanish
parallel corpus in the Copenhagen Dependency Treebank:
<align out=?a56? type=?? in=?b30+b32+b8? outsign=?af?
insign=?del de de?/>
This is a translation unit. The word in position 56 in the source
string is aligned to the words in positions 8, 30 and 32 in the
target string, but note that the target string words do not appear
in chronological order. In some cases our algorithms take care
of this; they do not, however, in general search all possible com-
binations of words and alignments, but rely on the linear order
Sect. 2 discusses the frequency of inside-out
alignments in our hand-aligned corpora, whereas
Sect. 3 is about complex translation units. Sect. 4
briefly introduces formalisms for syntax-based ma-
chine translation, but some prior knowledge is as-
sumed. Sect. 5 brings the three sections together
and presents lower bounds on the coverage of the
systems discussed in Sect. 4, obtained by inspection
of the results in Sect. 2 and 3. Sect. 6 compares
our results to related work, in particular Zens and
Ney (2003).
2 Inside-out alignments
Wu (1997) identified so-called inside-out align-
ments, two alignment configurations that cannot be
induced by binary synchronous context-free gram-
mars; these alignment configurations, while infre-
quent in language pairs such as English?French
(Cherry and Lin, 2006; Wellington et al, 2006),
have been argued to be frequent in other lan-
guage pairs, incl. English?Chinese (Wellington et
al., 2006) and English?Spanish (Lepage and De-
noual, 2005). While our main focus is on config-
urations that involve discontinuous translation units,
the frequencies of inside-out alignments in our par-
allel corpora are also reported. Recall that inside-out
alignments are of the form (or upside-down):
a b c d
e f g h
or
a b c d
e f g h
Our findings are summarized in Figure 1. Note
that there is some variation across the corpora. The
fact that there are no inside-out alignments in cor-
pora 2?4 may be because annotators of these corpora
have been very conservative, i.e. there are many un-
aligned nodes; the first corpus, which is also part of
the Danish Dependency Treebank, also has very few
inside-out alignments. It is not entirely clear to us if
this has to do with the languages in question or the
annotation guide lines (cf. Danish?Spanish).
In the Danish?Spanish corpus and in the English?
German corpus the number of inside-out alignments
is very high. This, to some extent, has to do with the
number of words that are aligned to multiple words.
of the annotation. This was necessary to do relatively efficient
queries. The effect, however, is that our results are lower than
the actual frequencies in the parallel corpora. They are in this
sense also lower bounds.

Figure 1: Frequency of inside-out alignments.
Say, in the case of English?German, each inside-out
alignment is made out of eight two-word translation
units. There are 1,178 inside-out alignment modulo
translation units, i.e. when one or more inside-out
alignments over the same eight translation units only
count as one; this means that there would be 28 ?
1, 178 : 301, 568 inside-out alignments in total. The
actual number (191, 491) is smaller, but comparable.
The first example in the English?German corpus,
from sentence 2, illustrates this point. The sentences
are:
(5) Mr Jonckheer, I would like to thank you just as
warmly for your report on the seventh survey
on State aid in the European Union .
(6) Ebenso herzlich mo?chte ich Ihnen, Herr
Jonckheer, fu?r Ihren Bericht u?ber den

and the alignment structure is (commas count):
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
?1
3 4 5 7 8 9 24
The aligned translation units are:4
4Note that the alignment 3|5 is probably a mistake made by
the annotator. It should, it seems, be 3|6. Note also that this
alignment is not involved in any of the inside-out alignments.
?Mr|Herr? ?Jonckheer|Jonckheer?
?,|Ihnen . . . ,? ?I|ich?
?would like to|mo?chte? ?thank|danken?
?you|Ihnen?
Note that the following sets of alignments make
up distinct inside-out alignments modulo translation
units:
{?1|7, 4|4, 8|24, 9|5?, ?2|8, 4|4, 8|24, 9|5?,
?3|9, 4|4, 8|24, 9|5?, ?1|7, 5|3, 8|24, 9|5?,
?2|8, 5|3, 8|24, 9|5?, ?3|9, 5|3, 8|24, 9|5?}
The following sets of alignments in addition make
up distinct inside-out alignments, but the new align-
ments 6|3 and 7|3 are from the same translation unit
as 5|3:
{?1|7, 6|3, 8|24, 9|5?, ?2|8, 6|3, 8|24, 9|5?,
?3|9, 6|3, 8|24, 9|5?, ?1|7, 6|3, 8|24, 9|5?,
?2|8, 6|3, 8|24, 9|5?, ?3|9, 6|3, 8|24, 9|5?}
Consequently, the alignment of sentences (5) and
(6) in the English?German parallel corpus contains
12 inside-out alignments, but only six inside-out
alignments modulo translation units.
3 Cross-serial discontinuous translation
units
A discontinuous translation unit (DTU) is a transla-
tion unit where either the substring of source string
words or the substring of target string words that oc-
cur in it, is discontinuous, i.e. there is a gap in it.
Since translation units are induced by simulta-
neous recognition, it is necessary for synchronous
22
grammars to have rules that introduce multiple
source side terminals and/or multiple target side ter-
minals with at least one intervening nonterminal to
induce DTUs. A DTU with multiple gaps in the
same side is called a multigap DTU; it is easy to see
that binary grammars cannot induce multigap DTUs
with more than two gaps.
A sequence of DTUs is said to be cross-serial if it
is of the following form (or upside-down):
ai aj
bk bl bm bn
Call any sequence of cross-serial DTUs a cross-
serial DTU (CDTU). So a CDTU is an alignment
configuration such that the source-side, resp. target-
side, contains four tokens bk, bl, bm, bn such that (i)
bk ? bl ? bm ? bn, (ii) bk and bm belong to the
same translation unit T , and bl and bn belong to the
same translation unit T ?, and (iii) T and T ? are dis-
tinct translation units. The inability of ITGs, xITGs
and 2-STSGs to induce CDTUs follows from the ob-
servation that if bk and bm in the above are gener-
ated or recognized simultatenously in any of these
formalisms, bl and bn cannot be generated or recog-
nized simulaneously. This is a straight-forward con-
sequence of the context-freeness of the component
grammars.
The distinction between CDTUs and CDTUs
modulo translation units (CDTU-ms) is again im-
portant. The number of CDTU-ms is the number of
CDTUs such that all CDTUs differ by at most one
translation unit. The English?German parallel cor-
pus, for example, contains 15,717 CDTUs, but only
2,079 CDTU-ms. Since our evaluation measure is
TUER, we only systematically counted the occur-
rences of CDTU-ms. In a few cases, the number of
CDTUs was extracted too. In general, it was about
eight times higher than the number of CDTU-ms.
Our findings are summarized in Figure 2. There is
again variation, but the average ratio of CDTU-ms is
0.514, i.e. there is a CDTU-m in about every second
aligned sentence pair.
4 Syntax-based machine translation
Syntax-directed translation schemas (SDTSs) were
originally introduced by Culik (1966) and studied
formally by Aho and Ullman (1972), who stressed
the importance of using only binary SDTSs for effi-
ciency reasons,5 and later led to the development of
a number of near-equivalent theories, incl. 2-SCFGs
and (normal form) ITGs. Henceforth, we will refer
to this class of near-equivalent theories as ITGs (see
footnote 1). This also means that production rules
have at most one source-side and one target-side ter-
minal on the RHS (see below).
It is the ability of ITGs to induce alignments that
is our main focus. Related work includes Wu (1997),
Zens and Ney (2003) and Wellington et al (2006).
Our results will also be extended to xITGs, 2-STSGs
and 2-STAGs. O(|G|n6) time recognition algo-
rithms are known for ITGs, xITGs and 2-STSGs. 2-
STAGs (O(|G|n12)) are more complex.
The production rules in ITGs are of the follow-
ing form (Wu, 1997), with a notation similar to what
is typically used for SDTSs and SCFGs in the right
column:
A ? [BC] A ? ?B1C2, B1C2?
A ? ?BC? A ? ?B1C2, C2B1?
A ? e | f A ? ?e, f?
A ? e | ? A ? ?e, ??
A ? ? | f A ? ??, f?
It is important to note that RHSs of production
rules have at most one source-side and one target-
side terminal symbol. This prevents induction of
multiword translation units in any straight-forward
way. xITGs (Zens and Ney, 2003) in part solves this
problem. All production rules in ITGs can be pro-
duction rules in xITGs, but xITG production rules
can also be of the following form:
A ? [e/f1A?/f2] | ?e/f1A?/f2?
Note, however, that these production rules still do
not enable double-sided DTUs, i.e. DTUs that trans-
late into DTUs. Such, however, occur relatively fre-
quently in hand-aligned parallel corpora, e.g. 148
times in the Danish?Spanish corpus.
There is no room for detailed introductions of the
more complex formalisms, but briefly their differ-
ences can be summarized as follows:
The move from ITGs to 2-STSGs is relatively
simple. All production rules in ITGs characterize
5The hierarchy of SDTSs of rank k is non-collapsing, and
the recognition problem without a fixed rank is NP-hard (Aho
and Ullman, 1972; Rambow and Satta, 1994). See Zhang et
al. (2006) for an efficient binarization algorithm.

binary trees of depth 1. It is said that this is the do-
main of locality in ITGs. 2-STSGs extend the do-
main of locality to arbitrarily big trees. 2-STSGs
are collections of ordered pairs of aligned trees with
at most two pairs of linked nonterminals. The leaf
nodes in the trees may be decorated by terminals or
insertion slots where subtrees can be ?plugged in?.
This is exactly what is meant by tree substitution.
It is assumed that all terminals in a tree pair con-
stitute a translation unit. There exists a O(|G|n6)
time parsing algorithm for 2-STSGs. 2-STSGs in-
duce DTUs, double-sided DTUs and DTUs with at
most two gaps, but not inside-out alignments, CD-
TUs and multigap DTUs with more than two gaps.
The substitution operation on elementary trees is
supplied with an adjunction operation in 2-STAGs
(Shieber and Schabes, 1990; Harbusch and Poller,
1996; Nesson et al, 2008). In adjunction, auxil-
iary trees, i.e. elementary trees with a designated leaf
node labeled by a nonterminal identical to the non-
terminal that labels the root node, extend the derived
tree by expanding one of its nodes. If an auxiliary
tree t, with a root node and a leaf node both labeled
A, is adjoined at some node n also labeled A in a
derived tree t?, the subtree s? (of t?) rooted at n is re-
placed by t, and s? is then inserted at the leaf node of
t. In 2-STAGs, paired nodes across the source-side
and target-side trees are simultaneously expanded by
either substitution or adjunction. A O(|G|n12) pars-
ing algorithm can be deviced for 2-STAGs using the
techniques in Seki et al (1991). The following 2-
STAG translates Swiss-style cross-serial dependen-
cies {wambnxcmdny} into {w(ac)mx(bd)ny} and
thus induces cross-serial DTUs whenever m,n ? 1
(superscripts are pairings).

2-STAGs thus induce DTUs, double-sided DTUs,
CDTUs, but not multigap DTUs with more than two
gaps. 2-STAGs also induce inside-out alignments.

It is left for the reader to verify that this gram-
mar induces the first of the two inside-out alignment
configurations in Sect. 2.

TUERs can be derived. ITGs, for instance, will have
a TUER of at least 2.6% + 12.1% = 14.7% for
Danish?Spanish,6 while 2-STSGs, ignoring prob-
lems caused by multigap DTUs with more than two
gaps, will have a TUER of at least 7.0% + 9.0% =
16.0% for English?Portuguese. Similarly lower
bounds on AER for ITGs can be obtained by sum-
ming IOs/As, i.e. the number of inside-out align-
ments over the number of alignments, DTUs/As
and CDTUs/As; for 2-STSGs, the lower bounds are
given by IOs/As + CDTUs/As; and so on. Even
2-STAGs exclude alignments found in the data,
namely multigap DTUs. The number of multi-
gap DTUs (MDTUs) in the corpora documented in
Graca et al (2008) range from 3?11 (in a 100 sen-
tences) with an average of 5.8. Exact results for
each formalism that include double-sided DTUs and
multigap DTUs will be included in a future publi-
cation, but it is clear to us that both configurations
are less frequent than inside-out alignments and CD-
TUs. In the Danish?Spanish parallel corpus the
number of DTUs with three or more gaps is 448 out
of which 182 are CDTUs. In the English?German
parallel corpus, the numbers are, resp., 2,529 and
996.
6It was recently suggested to us by a colleague that the lower
bounds need not be additive. It is, theoretically, possible that
the errors associated with CDTUs subsume some of the errors
associated with inside-out alignments, i.e. that it is possible to
remove one alignment or translation unit from the Gold standard
alignment structure such that both the CDTU-ms count goes
down by one, and the inside-out alignment count goes down by
one. It is left for future work to estimate this bias, but it seems
to us that such subsumptions will be infrequent.

Zens and Ney (2003) used GIZA++ to word-align
the Verbmobil task (English and German) and the
Canadian Hansards task (English and French) and
tested the coverage of ITGs and xITGs, i.e. the ratio
of the number of alignment configurations that could
be induced by the theories and the sentences in the
two tasks. The results are presented below:
ITG xITG
Verbmobil (G?E) 91.6% 96.5%
Verbmobil (E?G) 87.0% 96.9%
Can. Hansards (F?E) 81.3% 96.1%
Can. Hansards (E?F) 73.6% 95.6%
Note that the average differences in coverage be-
tween ITGs and xITGs for English-German (7.4%)
and English?French (18.4%) are comparable to
the DTUs/TUs ratios for English?German (7.4%),
resp. English?French (10.1%) in our parallel cor-
pora. Compare also the average error rate of
xITGs for English and German (3.3%) and English
and French (4.15%) to the CDTU-ms/TUs ratios
for English?German (3.0%) and English?French
(4.1%).
This data provides strong support that inside-out
alignments and cross-serial DTUs are the main the-
oretical challenge for syntax-based machine trans-
lation; in addition, training is a major challenge
(Zhang and Gildea, 2004). In real-life applications,
AERs and TUERs will be significantly higher than
the empirical lower bounds obtained here, e.g. 40%
for Chinese?English in Zhang and Gildea (2004),
but in principal future results should converge on
them.
7 Discussion
In machine translation, as in all other branches of
computer science, there is a trade-off between ex-
pressivity and complexity. The results presented
here, namely that classes of alignment structures ex-
cluded by syntax-based translation systems, occur
frequently in hand-aligned parallel corpora, could
be taken to indicate that more expressive formalisms
are needed. This at least seems to be the case to the
extent alignment error rates are reasonable measures
of the adequacy of syntax-based machine translation
systems. On the other hand parsing complexities in
syntax-based machine translation are very high al-
ready, i.e. O(|G|n6) and higher. Consequently, it
is not advisable to gain more expressivity at the ex-
pense of parsing complexity. This need not be nec-
essary either, however. There are at least two other
possibilities:
? Either the cake can be cut differently, i.e. to ex-
clude other classes of alignment structures that
occur less frequently. This idea has to the best
of our knowledge not been explored in the con-
text of syntax-based machine translation.
? It is also possible to design formalisms for
syntax-based machine translation that induce
all possible alignment structures and maintain
a reasonable parsing complexity (O(|G|n6)),
e.g. S?gaard (2008b); but as noted by
S?gaard (2008a) the gain in expressivity is
at the expense of the complexity of learn-
ing. Finally, it can be shown that there are
no computable tight estimators for the proba-
bilistic extension of the formalism introduced
in S?gaard (2008b).7
8 Conclusion
It was shown how the frequency of certain classes of
alignment structures induce empirical lower bounds
on the alignment error rates that can be obtained
with these systems. Some of these lower bounds
are quite significant, e.g. 14.7% (TUER) for ITGs
wrt. Danish?Spanish and 17.6% wrt. Portuguese-
French. Slightly lower, but still significant, bounds
exist for more complex formalisms such as 2-STSGs
and 2-STAGs.
7Two other challenges for this type of approach are: (i)
The use of intersection in S?gaard (2008b) to induce inside-
out alignments and cross-serial DTUs seems to miss important
generalizations; see Chiang (2004) for a similar point in the
context of parsing. (ii) If the class of alignment structures is re-
stricted in any natural way, i.e. to 1 : 1 alignments, the problem
whether there exists a possible alignment given two sentences
and a grammar becomes NP-hard (S?gaard, 2009). NB: The
undecidability of computing tight estimators was pointed out to
us by Mark-Jan Nederhof (p.c.), but Alexander Clark (p.c.) and
others have suggested that pseudo-tight estimators can be used
in practice.
