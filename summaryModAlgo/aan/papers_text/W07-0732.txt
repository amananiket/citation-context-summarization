Abstract 
This article describes the combination of a 
SYSTRAN system with a ?statistical post-
editing? (SPE) system. We document 
qualitative analysis on two experiments 
performed in the shared task of the ACL 
2007 Workshop on Statistical Machine 
Translation. Comparative results and more 
integrated ?hybrid? techniques are dis-
cussed. 
1 Introduction 
The evolution of SYSTRAN?s architecture over 
the last years has been to ? open ? the system to 
enable interaction between the internal system?s 
rules and the external input ? see Senellart (2003), 
Attnas et al (2005). Based on this architecture, 
several directions are explored to introduce the use 
of ? corpus-based ? approaches at several levels of 
the process: 
- use of corpus-based tools to validate and enrich 
linguistic resources (detection of forbidden se-
quences, bilingual terminology extraction), - auto-
matic recognition of the text domain, - use of a 
corpus-based decision mechanism within ? word 
boundary ? (Chinese word identification), disam-
biguation? - use of word sense disambiguation 
techniques ? and the use of a  language model in 
the generation phase to select alternative transla-
tions, prepositions, and local reordering (adjective 
positioning). 
These tools have been presented in Senellart 
(2006) and most of them will be integrated in 
SYSTRAN version 7 systems. 
Independently, two experiments were carried 
out for the shared task of the ACL 2007 Workshop 
on Statistical Machine Translation to combine a 
raw SYSTRAN system with a statistical post-
editing (SPE) system. One experiment was run by 
NRC using the language pair English<>French in 
the context of ? Automatic Post-Edition ? systems 
using the PORTAGE system as described in Si-
mard et al (2007). The second experiment based 
on the same principle was run on the Ger-
man>English and Spanish>English1 language pairs 
using the Moses system (Koehn et al 2007). The 
objective was to train a SMT system on a parallel 
corpus composed of SYSTRAN translations with 
the referenced source aligned with its referenced 
translation. 
Beyond both (a) the huge (and expected) im-
provement of the BLEU score for the combined 
system compared to raw translation output (for 
German-English, around 10 BLEU points for the 
Europarl test set of WMT2007) and (b) the (ex-
pected) corresponding improvement of the transla-
tion fluency, we provide qualitative analysis on the 
contributions (positive and negative) of the SPE 
layer imposed on the SYSTRAN translation output 
in this paper. For this analysis we classifiy the dif-
ferent types of ?post-editing? changes and point 
out the alternative isolated statistical components 
that could achieve the same results. 
 We conclude with two possible approaches: 
breaking down the ?statistical layer? into different 
components/tools each specialized in a narrow and 
accurate area, or refining this global SPE approach 
in order to introduce linguistic constraints.

 2 The SYSTRAN System 
Covering 80 language pairs for 22 different source 
languages, SYSTRAN powers almost all major 
portals (Google, Yahoo!, BabelFish, Apple, 
Worldlingo, ?) with machine translation services 
through URL translations or translation ?boxes? 
(estimated traffic: over 40 million sentence transla-
tions and over 10 million web page translations per 
day). 
Customized systems are used by corporate custom-
ers either within a post-editing workflow, or with-
out post-editing for the translation of technical 
Knowledge Bases. 
SYSTRAN engines are also available as desktop 
applications through ?plugins? or within post-
editing tools.  The same engines are also available 
on ultra-light architectures such as for PDA de-
vices. 
The SYSTRAN system is traditionally classi-
fied as a ?rule-based? system and its design ? 
which has been in constant evolution - has, over 
the years, always been driven by pragmatic consid-
erations ? progressively integrating most of the 
available productive techniques. As such, it is dif-
ficult to classify SYSTRAN and simply describe 
its architecture. However, the evolution of the 
SYSTRAN system is governed by the following 
principles: 
? provide a deterministic output : it is possi-
ble to easily explain the translation results 
for a specific sentence and change the rule 
? incremental translation quality: the more 
important evaluation criterion for mature 
systems is to perform a comparative evalua-
tion of translation output between two con-
secutive versions. Since it is impossible to 
guarantee 0 regressions in linguistic devel-
opment, 8 improvements for 1 degradation 
defines the acceptance criterion for a lin-
guistic patch. 
Crucial components of the SYSTRAN system 
are the linguistic resources for each lan-
guage/language pair ranging from 100k to 800k 
entries. Such ?entries? should be understood as 
both simple or multiword ?lexical entries? but also 
as customized  disambiguation rules. 
 
In this context (continuous integration of new 
techniques in SYSTRAN engines, adhering to de-
terminism and incrementability), over the last three 
years one major evolution within SYSTRAN has 
been to make use of available corpora - statically 
through extraction/learning/validation tools such as: 
? Dictionary improvement using a monolin-
gual corpus: new terms/entities/terminology 
extraction (n-grams based on linguistic pat-
terns); 
and dynamically through corpus-based decision 
algorithms such as: 
? Word sense disambiguation 
? Use of a language model to select alterna-
tive translations, determiner choice, and lo-
cal controlled reordering ? like multiple ad-
jective sequences. 
 
In the following section, we present a qualitative 
review of the SYSTRAN+SPE output and analyze 
how the different contributions relate to each spe-
cific effort. 
3 Experimental Results & Linguistic 
Evaluation 
Based on the data from these two experiments: 
SYSTRAN+PORTAGE (En<>Fr), and 
SYSTRAN+Moses (De>En, Es>En), we 
performed linguistic evaluations on the differences 
between raw SYSTRAN output and 
SYSTRAN+SPE output. The evaluation for 
En<>Fr was performed on the News Commentary 
test 2006 corpus, while the evaluations for De>En, 
and Es>En were performed on the Europarl test 
2007 corpus. 
3.1 Impact 
The first observation is the impact of the SPE on 
the SYSTRAN output. Table 1 displays the WCR 
(Word Change Rate2) and the ratio of sentences 
impacted by the statistical post-editing. It is inter-
esting to note that the impact is quite high since 
almost all sentences were post-edited. On the other 
hand, the WCR of SYSTRAN+SPE is relatively 
small ? as this clearly relates to post-editing and 
not a complete reshuffling of the translation. The 
same insight is reinforced when reviewing a com-
parator (see Table 2) ? the SYSTRAN+SPE output

 Word Change Rate is computed similarly to the Word 
Error Rate, with regard to the SYSTRAN output.

 is ?reasonably? close to the raw SYSTRAN output, 
and the SPE output structure is completely based 
on the SYSTRAN output.

3.2 Linguistic Categorization of Different 
Post-Editing Changes 
To classify the types of ?post-editing? changes 
brought by the SPE system, we define the follow-
ing criteria: 
? termchg ? changes related to lexical changes.  
o termchg_nfw ? word not translated by SYSTRAN 
generating a translation with SPE. 
o termchg_term ? slight terminology change pre-
serves part of speech and meaning. Most of the time 
changes improve fluency by selecting the appropriate 
terminology. (e.g. politicians?politiciens vs. the more 
commonly used ?hommes politiques?). 
o termchg_loc ? multiword expression/locution 
change (the same is true?Le m?me est vrai vs. C?est 
?galement vrai) 
o termchg_mean ? lexical modification altering the 
meaning of the sentences, by changing the part of 
speech of the word, or by selecting a completely differ-
ent meaning for a given word. (Despite occasional 
grumbles?En d?pit des grognements occasionnels vs. 
En d?pit des maux ?conomiser) 
? gram ? changes related to grammar 
o gram_det ? change in determiner (on political com-
mitments?sur des engagements politiques vs. sur les 
engagements politiques) 
o gram_prep ? change in preposition (across the 
Atlantic?? travers l?atlantique vs. de l?autre c?t? de 
l?atlantique) 
o gram_pron ? change in pronoun 
o gram_tense ? change in tense (should not be hid-
den?ne devraient? vs. ne doivent?) 
o gram_number/gram_gender ? change in num-
ber/gender ? often reflecting lack of agreement 
o gram_other ? other grammatical changes 
? punct/digit/case ? change in punctuation, case, or 
numbers 
? wordorder_local ? change in local word order 
? wordorder_long ? change in word order (long distance) 
? style ? change in ?style? (justifying?justifiant vs. ce qui 
justifie)

3.3 Analysis of Results 
The figures from the previous section provide very 
useful information that requires deeper analysis, 
the most obvious of which follow: 
? As is, this basic integration does not meet 
the acceptance criterion ?8 improv. for 1 de-
grad.?  
? The most improved category is the 
?termchg? which corresponds to a local 
choice of word sense or alternative 
translation of words and locutions. In this 
category, the main source degradation stems 
from the ?termchg_mean? category. This 
category covers changes of lexical unit parts 
of speech. 
? In grammatical categories, productive 
categories are ?gram_det? and ?gram_prep? 
but the improvement/degradation ratio for 
this last category is very low (it shows 
global improvements but there are many 
unacceptable degradations). 
? As expected, no ?long-distance? restruc-
turing is observed and local reordering is 
negative for En>Fr and relatively negligible 
for other language pairs. 
? For the French target, morphology is a ma-
jor issue (accounts for 25% of degradations). 
This was also expected since no mechanism 
in the SPE provides any control over the 
morphology. 
4 Conclusions 
The SYSTRAN+SPE experiments demonstrate 
very good results ? both on automatic scoring and 
on linguistic analysis. Detailed comparative analy-
sis provides directions on how to further improve 
these results by adding ?linguistic control? mecha-
nisms. For SPE, we would, for instance, add lin-
guistic constraints in the decoding process, know-
ing that the structure/linguistic information could 
be made available in the translation output.  
Beyond the scope of these experiments, our re-
sults set a baseline to compare with other more 
sophisticated/integrated ?rules and statistics? com-
bination models.  
In particular, the most improved categories ob-
served in these experiments confirm that our cur-
rent development direction for integrating data-
driven mechanisms within translation engines (es-
pecially for word sense disambiguation, for the 
selection of alternative translations or for specific 
local phenomena like determination) should con-
verge on the same results while preventing associ-
ated degradations. Also, the high score reached by 
the ?termchg_loc? category substantiates the need 
to continue exploiting phrase tables built on 
parallel corpora to learn new terminology.
