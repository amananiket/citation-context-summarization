Extracting Protein-Protein interactions using simple contextual features

1 Introduction
There has been much interest in recent years on the
topic of extracting Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI)
information automatically from scientific publica-
tions. This is due to the need that has emerged to
organise the large body of literature that is gener-
ated through research, and collected at sites such
as PubMed. Easy access to the information con-
tained in published work is vital for facilitating new
research, but the rate of publication makes manual
collection of all such data unfeasible. Information
Extraction approaches based on Natural Language
Processing can be, and are already being used, to fa-
cilitate this process.
The dominant approach so far has been the use
of hand-built, knowledge-based systems, working
at levels ranging from surface syntax to full parses
(Blaschke and Valencia, 2002; Huang et al, 2004;
Plake et al, 2005; Rebholz-Schuhmann et al, 2005;
Yakushiji et al, 2005). A similar work to the one
presented here is by (Sugiyama et al, 2003), but it
is not possible to compare results due to differing
datasets and the limited information available about
their methods.
2 Data
A gene-interaction corpus derived from the BioCre-
AtIvE task-1A data will be used for the experiments.
This data was kindly made available by Jo?rg Haken-
berg1 and is described in (Plake et al, 2005). The
data consists of 1000 sentences marked up for POS
1See http://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/ haken-
ber/publ/suppl/sac05/
tags, genes (both genes and proteins are marked as
?gene?; the terms will be used interchangeably in
this paper) and iWords. The corpus contains 255
relations, all of which are intra-sentential, and the
?interaction word? (iWord)2 for each relation is also
marked up.
I utilise the annotated entities, and focus only on
relation extraction. The data contains directionality
information for each relation, denoting which entity
is the ?agent? and which the ?target?, or denoting that
this distinction cannot be made. This information
will not be used for the current experiments, as my
main aim is simply to identify relations between en-
tities, and the derivation of this information will be
left for future work.
I will be using the Naive Bayes, KStar, and JRip
classifiers from the Weka toolkit, Zhang Le?s Maxi-
mum Entropy classifier (Maxent), TiMBL, and Lib-
SVM to test performance. All experiments are done
using 10-fold cross-validation. Performance will be
measured using Recall, Precision and F1.
3 Experiments
Each possible combination of proteins and iWords
in a sentence was generated as a possible relation
?triple?, which combines the relation extraction task
with the additional task of finding the iWord to de-
scribe each relation. 3400 such triples occur in the
data. After each instance is given a probability by
the classifiers, the highest scoring instance for each
protein pairing is compared to a threshold to decide

formative of when a PPI occurs, such as interact, bind, inhibit,
phosphorylation. See footnote 1 for complete list.

the outcome. Correct triples are those that match the
iWord assigned to a PPI by the annotators.
For each instance, a list of features were used to
construct a ?generic? model :
interindices The combination of the indices of the
proteins of the interaction; ?P1-position:P2-
position?
interwords The combination of the lexical forms
of the proteins of the interaction; ?P1:P2?
p1prevword, p1currword, p1nextword The lexi-
cal form of P1, and the two words surrounding
it
p2prevword, p2currword, p2nextword The lexi-
cal form of P2, and the two words surrounding
it
p2pdistance The distance, in tokens, between the
two proteins
inbetween The number of other identified proteins
between the two proteins
iWord The lexical form of the iWord
iWordPosTag The POS tag of the iWord
iWordPlacement Whether the iWord is between,
before or after the proteins
iWord2ProteinDistance The distance, in words,
between the iWord and the protein nearest to
it
A second model incorporates greater domain-
specific features, in addition to those of the ?generic?
model :
patterns The 22 syntactic patterns used in (Plake et
al., 2005) are each used as boolean features3.
lemmas and stems Lemma and stem information
was used instead of surface forms, using a sys-
tem developed for the biomedical domain.
4 Results
Tables 1 and 2 show the results for the two models
described above. The system achieves a peak per-
3These patterns are in regular expression form, i.e. ?P1
word{0,n} Iverb word{0,m} P2?. This particular pattern
matches sentences where a protein is followed by an iWord that
is a verb, with a maximum of n words between them, and fol-
lowing this by m words maximum is another protein. In their
paper, (Plake et al, 2005) optimise the values for n and m using

what they report as being the best unoptimized setting.
formance of 59.2% F1, which represents a notice-
able improvement over previous results on the same
dataset (52% F1 (Plake et al, 2005)), and demon-
strates the feasibility of the approach adopted.
It is seen that simple contextual features are quite
informative for the task, but that a significant gains
can be made using more elaborate methods.
