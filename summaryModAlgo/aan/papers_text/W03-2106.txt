Abstract
We present an overview of a compre-
hensive formal theory of the interpreta-
tion of sentential fragments, which has
as components an empirically validated
taxonomy, an analysis of the syntax and
compositional semantics of fragments,
and a formalisation of their contextual
interpretation. We also briefly describe
an implementation of this theory, and
quantify the potential practical use of
handling fragments in dialogue systems.
1 Introduction
In dialogue settings, people frequently produce ut-
terances which, despite being non-sentential, con-
vey propositions, questions or requests. For in-
stance, B?s utterance in (1) of the NP ?John? con-
veys in this context the proposition ?John came to
the party.?
(1) A: Who came to the party?
B: John.
Clearly, the interpretation of such non-sentential
utterances or fragments, as they are traditionally
called (eg. (Morgan, 1973)) is highly context de-
pendent. In this paper we present an overview of
a comprehensive formal theory of the interpretation
of fragments.1
The theory has as components an empirically val-
idated taxonomy, an analysis of the syntax and com-
positional semantics of fragments, and a formal-
isation of their contextual interpretation. We also
briefly describe an implementation of this theory,
1More details can be found in (Schlangen, 2003).
and quantify the potential practical use of handling
utterances of this kind in dialogue systems.
The main thesis of our approach is that the res-
olution of the intended content of fragments can be
modelled as a by-product of the establishment of
coherence in dialogue, which (following much of
the work on discourse) we define as the establish-
ment of a meaningful connection of the content of
the current utterance to its discourse context. We
will show that the constraints on the form and con-
tent of fragments follow from such connections.
There has recently been some renewed interest
in fragments. For example, (Carberry, 1990) of-
fers an approach where computationally expens-
ive plan-recognition techniques are employed for
their interpretation. As we will show, this fails
to predict certain empirical facts and further, we
will show that the complex reasoning with cognit-
ive states that she employs can often be replaced
with much simpler inferences based on linguistic
information. (Ginzburg and Sag, 2001) on the other
hand uses grammar-based methods which, as we
will show, are too weak to explain the interpreta-
tion of certain kinds of fragments where their miss-
ing content is linguistically implicit and has to be
inferred. Moreover, we will show that the non-
compositionality of that approach has certain dis-
advantages.
The remainder of the paper is organised as fol-
lows. We first describe our empirically validated,
two-dimensional taxonomy of fragment-types and
say something about the distribution of these types
in corpora. In our theory, the type instantiated by
a given fragment determines how it is resolved, but
before we formalise this in Section 5, we present in
Sections 3 and 4 respectively an analysis of the se-
mantics and syntax of such utterances in isolation.
This separation of grammar and resolution has cer-
tain advantages, as we discuss in comparison to pre-
vious work.
2 A Taxonomy of Fragments
2.1 The Taxonomy
We classify fragments according to two dimen-
sions. In the first dimension, the criterion for clas-
sification is the source of the material that is needed
for resolution. In examples like (1), all informa-
tion that is required to resolve the meaning of the
fragment (we will soon say something about what
kind of information we assume this to be, syntactic
or semantic) is present in the context: the resolu-
tion ?John came to the party? can be computed by
identifying the ?missing? content in ?John? with ele-
ments from the utterance it is related to, ie. the ques-
tion. We call this type of resolution resolution-via-
identity. However, there are also examples where
required information is linguistically implicit, as in
(2).
(2) A: Why did John leave?
B: Exams.
If John is a student and this fact is mutually known
by the dialogue participants, then B?s utterance is
presumably resolved to something like ?John left
because he has to take an exam soon?. This res-
olution contains elements that are not linguistically
explicit in the utterance to which the fragment is a
reply; the resolution has to be inferred, from both
linguistic sources (the content of the fragment and
the content of its discourse context) and also extra-
linguistic sources (knowledge about preparing for
exams, for example). Hence we call this type of
resolution resolution-via-inference. We will show
below that there are different constraints on frag-
ments of these types.
In the second dimension fragments are categor-
ised by their discourse-function or rhetorical role
with respect to elements of the context. For ex-
ample, in both (1) and (2), the fragment provides
an answer to a question, and so we call the type
these fragments instantiate Question-Answer Pair
(QAP).2 As this name suggests, strictly speaking
this dimension does not classify fragments as such,
but rather the relation a given fragment has to ele-
ments of its context. To make this explicit, our types
are defined as relations, that is, the element of the
2That both (1) and (2) instantiate this type shows
that the dimensions are indeed independent, since as dis-
cussed above in the first dimension they belong to differ-
ent classes.
context the fragment connects to is explicitly part
of what individuates the type.3
As a theoretical backbone for the taxonomy, we
used the rhetorical relations defined by a theory
of discourse structure called SDRT (Asher, 1993;
Asher and Lascarides, 2003), which is also the
framework in which we formalised the resolution
of fragments. However, we also used corpora
to motivate the set of fragment-types in our tax-
onomy. We manually identified all instances of
non-sentential utterances in a number of transcripts
of dialogues and classified their relation to the con-
text.4 The resulting list of relations is given in
Tables 1 and 2, together with informal definitions
of the semantics of each relation (where ? is the
fragment and ? the utterance it is related to) and
an example instance. We will not go into more de-
tails of the types here; in Section 5 we will return
to a select few and give a formal definition of their
semantics. Note that we do not claim that this set
of fragment-types is exhaustive; we discuss in the
next section the coverage that can be achieve with
it on test data.5 As a final point, note that we sub-
sume what is often called ?clarification question?
(eg. (Ginzburg and Cooper, 2001)) under Elabora-
tion to stress the similarity with ?normal? elabora-
tions. The subscripts
p
and
q
indicate the message
type of ? and ?; e.g. Elab
pq
is an elaboration of a
proposition, performed with a question.
2.2 Corpus Study
To test the coverage that can be achieved with
our taxonomy, we analysed 5087 items of general
free conversation from the BNC (dialogues KSU
and KSV), and 4037 items of task-oriented dia-
logue from the VM/redwoods corpus (the 125 dia-
logues on the VM-CD-ROM 6).6 We proceeded
3All taxonomies of fragment-types that are known
to us use classes that are at least partially determined
by the rhetorical function of the fragment (eg., that of
(Carberry, 1990) as well as that of (Ferna?ndez and Gin-
zburg, 2002)); nevertheless, to our knowledge ours is the
only one to make this inherent relationality explicit in the
formal definition of the classes.
4For this we used two dialogue transcripts from the
BNC (Aston and Burnard, 1998) and five dialogues from
the Verbmobil corpus (Wahlster, 2000).
5A systematic omission are relations that connect re-
quests. In the dialogues we looked at (which were nego-
tiations and free conversation) these did not occur; how-
ever, in more task-oriented dialogues they will presum-
ably be quite frequent. Note that there is no principled
reason for not including them, and our approach could
easily be extended accordingly.
6We held out this data in the compilation stage, and
so ?training? and ?test-data? are disjoint.

Results Numbers about the frequency of frag-
ments in our corpus and about the achieved cover-
age overall are presented in Table 3. For reasons of
space, we cannot show the detailed distribution of
the classes here; what is noteworthy about it is that
the majority of fragment instances is concentrated
in a few classes, with the rest of the classes only
represented by a few examples each. The most fre-
quent type is QAP, followed by Elab

SUMMARY
items analysed 9142
Fragments 931 (= 10.2%)
classfd. 865 (= 93% of fragments)
other 66 (= 7% of fragments)
Table 3: Results of Annotation
Discussion The overall percentage of fragments
we have found seems to confirm the results of
earlier studies (Thompson, 1980; Ferna?ndez and
Ginzburg, 2002), which also classified as frag-
ments around 10% of the utterances in the dialogues
they looked at. (Ferna?ndez and Ginzburg, 2002)
also offers a taxonomy of fragment types; the au-
thors claim to have reached a coverage which is
much higher than what we achieved (99% com-
pared to our 93%). We think this can partially be
explained by the fact that the classes they use are
more surface-oriented. For example, they have a
class ?sluice?, which is defined as ?bare question-
denoting wh-phrases? (Ferna?ndez and Ginzburg,
2002, p.16). We make a finer distinction, split-
ting this class further according to the rhetorical
function played by the fragmental question (eg.,
Expl
q
, Expl?
q
, Narr
q
, Elab
q
). Hence, to classify a
given fragment we need more information about its
rhetorical function; information which sometimes
is difficult to recover from a transcript. While a
surface-oriented approach to defining classes is an
advantage for annotation, it is a hindrance for form-
ally defining their semantics, as we will argue be-
low.
In conclusion, we think that this corpus study has
shown that our taxonomy has satisfactory empirical
motivation. In the next two sections we look at frag-
ments in isolation. We return to the taxonomy when
we give an example of the formal semantics of re-
lations and show how they determine the resolution
of the fragments.
3 A Compositional Semantics for
Fragments
For compositional semantic analysis we use Min-
imal Recursion Semantics (MRS, (Copestake et al,
1999)), a language in which partial descriptions of
formulae of a logical language (the base language)
can be expressed. This allows one to leave cer-
tain semantic distinctions unresolved, reflecting the
idea that syntax supplies only partial information
about meaning. Technically this is achieved via a
strategy that has become standard in computational
semantics (e.g., (Reyle, 1993)): one assigns labels
to bits of base language formulae so that state-
ments about their combination can remain ?under-
specified?. The (first-order) models of formulae of
this latter language then can be seen as standing in
a direct relation to formulae of the base language;
M |= ? then means that the (unique) base-language
formula corresponding to M is described by the
MRS ?.8 By way of example, (3) shows an MRS-
representation of ?Everyone loves someone?, where
so-called elementary predications (EPs) are labelled
with handles (h
n
), with h being the top handle that
outscopes all others; ?h
1
=
q
h
2
? stands for an ?out-
scopes? relation between EPs where only quantifiers
can be scoped in between h
1
and h
2
; prpstn rel sig-
nals that the MRS describes a proposition.
(3) ?h; e; {h : prpstn rel(h
1
); h
2
: love v rel(e; x
1
; x
2
);
h
6
: every rel(x
1
; h
8
; h
9
);
h
10
: person rel(x
1
);
h
11
: some rel(x
2
; h
12
; h
13
);
h
14
: person rel(x
2
)};
{ h
1
=
q
h
2
; h
8
=
q
h
10
; h
12
=
q
h
14
}?
The compositional semantics of fragments leaves
more information unresolved than just semantic
scope, however. All we know about the meaning of
fragments like those in (1) and (2) independent from
their context is: (a) they will resolve to a proposi-
tion,9 of which (b) the main predicate is unknown,
but (c) one participant in the main event is specified
although its exact role isn?t. We represent this with
an anaphoric relation unknown rel, and so the NP-
fragment ?John.? (regardless of the context it stands
in) is represented as:
(4) ?h; e; {h : prpstn rel(h
1
);
h
2
: unknown rel(e; x);
h
6
: def np rel(x; h
8
; h
9
);
h
10
: named(x; John)};
{ h
1
=
q
h
2
; h
8
=
q
h
10
} ?
The unknown rel acts as a ?place-holder? for a po-
tentially complex sub-formula; more precisely it is
a constraint on the form of the described (base-
8Such a semantics if given to MRS in (Copestake et
al., 2001); we follow the similar formalisation in (Asher
and Lascarides, 2003). Note that we do not make any
assumptions about the base language and its logic here;
the descriptions are compatible with it being static first
order predicate logic, or a dynamic logic like DRT (Kamp
and Reyle, 1993).
9We make the simplifying assumption that there is
an unambiguous intonation pattern indicating whether a
fragment is intended to convey a proposition, a question
or a request.
language) formulae, that they contain at this place
a subformula, which in the case of (4) must have e
and x amongst its variables. Clearly, such a descrip-
tion then describes an infinite number of formulae;
however, all of these are potential resolutions of the
fragment. For instance, (4) (partially) describes the
intended resolution of the fragment in context (1)?
?John came to the party.??, but it also describes for
example ?Carl loves John.? or ?Sandy thinks that
Kim relies on John.?, which can be resolutions in
other contexts.
It is important to note that unknown rel is not a
second order variable (as it would be in an approach
in the vein of (Dalrymple et al, 1991)), and it is not
something that simply gets replaced by a predicate
symbol of the same arity. Rather, unknown rel is a
constraint more like the =
q
-constraints, constrain-
ing the ?shape? of the described formulae. It is ana-
phoric, because the sub-formula that is to be inser-
ted at this point in the described formula is not de-
termined by the grammar, but must be provided by
the context.
4 A Grammar of Fragments
4.1 The Analysis
Our grammatical analysis of fragments is relatively
straightforward: we make the assumption that frag-
ments are phrases,10 possibly modified by adverbs.
As (5) shows, only scopally modifying adverbs are
allowed.11
(5) A: Who sang this song?
B: Maybe Sandy. / *Badly Sandy.
In a pseudo phrase-structure notation, the rules
simply are of the form ?S-frag ? (ADV) XP?. We
formalise this in a version of HPSG that allows con-
structions (Sag, 1997) (ie. phrase-types that make
a semantic contribution) and that uses MRSs as se-
mantic representations. HPSG-representations of
these semantic structures consist of a feature IN-
DEX whose value represents the semantic index of
the sign; a feature LTOP that holds the handle of the
sign, ie. a label for the bits of logical form intro-
duced by it; LZT, which is a bag of labelled EPs;
and H-CONS, which collects the constraints on the
10This goes back to (Morgan, 1973); explicit rules
can be found in (Barton, 1990). We ignore for now
more complicated examples like ?A: Does John devour
or nibble at his food? ? B: Oh, John devours.?
11Note that the latter is licensed as an answer to a mul-
tiple wh-question like ?Who sang, and how??, in which
case we analyse it as a sequence of two fragments.

John
Figure 1: ?John? as a declarative fragment.
The formalisation is best explained with an ex-
ample. Figure 1 shows, in a tree representation, the
sign for the NP-fragment ?John.? It demonstrates
how the NP is lifted to the level of sentences, and
how the semantics of that sentence is composed.
Let?s work ?top-down? to describe this Figure in
detail. The root-sign in this tree has all the syn-
tactic features of a sentence: the value of its SYN-
SEM.LOCAL.CAT is of type verb, and all valence re-
quirements are satisfied. It is also semantically like
a sentence, in that its top-EP (with the handle 2 ) is
of type message (more precisely, a prpstn). This
EP is contributed by the fragment-rule, via the fea-
ture C-CONT (construction content). In the same
way the unknown rel-constraint that was intro-
duced in the previous section is added. The con-
nection of this constraint to the semantics of the
phrase is made via co-indexation of the argument-
slot of unknown rel with the INDEX of the argu-
ment phrase (in Figure 1 this is 5 ).
As the type-declaration in Figure 1 shows, this
sign is the combination of two types, namely
headed-phrase, which is a general type that defines
the features and co-indexations in headed phrases;
and np-nm-decl-frag, which collects the specifica-
tions particular to fragments. This type in turn in-
herits from three further types: np-frag, which spe-
cifies the particularities of fragments consisting of
NPs; nm-frag, which specifies non-modified frag-
ments (ie., a phrase that is not modified by an ad-
verb); and decl-frag, which indicates that the frag-
ments resolves to a proposition. These three types
encapsulate properties of fragments that can vary
independently; see the hierarchy in Figure 2.
We assume a generalised head-feature principle
(ghfp) as in (Ginzburg and Sag, 2001) according
to which all values for SYNSEM-features on the
mother are by default token-identical to those of the
daughter, and hence we have to make sure that the
fragment-types override this default where appro-
priate. For example, the value for SYNSEM.LOCAL
of fragments must be specified on the types for the
fragments, since it will always be different from
that of the head daughter?raising different XPs to
sentences is the whole point of the rule, and so the
default of the ghfp to copy these specifications must
be overridden. The value of SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT
will be the same for all types of fragments, namely
that of a sentence. In fact, the only elements of the
type instantiated in Figure 1 that are specific to NP-
fragments are the co-indexation of the INDEX of the
head (the NP) with the ARG of the unknown rel,
and the restriction that the phrase be an NP. So the
constraint unique to NP-fragments (ie., the specific-
ation of the type np-frag) is that shown in (6).

Finally, the last dimension organises the differences
in the type of message to which the fragment will
resolve. The example we have seen in Figure 1
was one of a propositional-fragment; fragmental
questions or requests only differ in the type of this
message-relation. To give an example, (8) shows
the type int(errogative)-frag(ment).

The rules in this dimension also make sure that wh-
phrases must be int-frags.
4.2 Implementation
We have implemented our analysis in a wide-
coverage HPSG, the English Resource Grammar
(ERG, see for example (Copestake and Flickinger,
2000));12 the implementation was evaluated us-
ing the grammar-profiling tool [incr tsdb()]
(Oepen and Flickinger, 1998). First, to test for
possible adverse effects on the analyses of full-
sentences, we ran a batch-parse of a test-suite of
full sentences, the CSLI-test-suite which is distrib-
uted with [incr tsdb()]. It consists of 1348
sentences, of which 961 are marked as syntactically
well-formed and 387 as ill-formed. Table 4 shows
a comparison of the original ERG with our extended
version containing the fragment rules, with respect
to the average number of parses per sentence.
12The implementation differs slightly from the analysis
described in the previous section: the ERG doesn?t make
use of defaults, and so we had to explicitly state what is
identical between mother and daughter and what isn?t.

ERG with the fragment-ERG
As these data show, the fragment rules introduce
some new ambiguity, but on average less than one
more parse per item. We conclude from this that
adding the fragment-rules doesn?t lead to an ex-
plosion of readings that would render the grammar
practically unusable. What this evaluation doesn?t
tell us, however, is whether the additional readings
(of what is meant to be full sentences) are erroneous
or not. The problem is that ?fragmenthood? is not a
syntactic criterion, and so some strings that can be
analysed as sentences can also be analysed as frag-
ments. E.g., ?leave? can be both an imperative sen-
tence and a VP-fragment (e.g. in the context of the
question ?What did John make Sandy do??).
To test the coverage of our extended grammar,
we used parts of the annotated corpus described
in Section 2.2. In 4037 items we identified 369
fragments, of which our grammar correctly parsed
242 (= 65.5%). A detailed study of the frag-
ments that were not recognised showed that a use-
ful extension would be rules for handling fragments
of the form ?CONJ XP?, eg. ?and on Saturday.?;
including those would bring our coverage up to
82.6% of the corpus. This result is in the same
order of magnitude as what the original grammar
achieves on full sentences, and is in the range of
what the best wide-coverage grammars that provide
semantic representations at present can achieve.
However, although extending the grammar in this
way is straightforward it would lead to a dramatic
rise in the number of average parses, and so for
practical purposes we did not carry out such an ex-
tension here.
5 Computing the Intended Meaning of
Fragments
5.1 Theory
The final problem we have to address is how the
underspecified semantic representations that our
grammar produces for fragments are resolved con-
textually. For this, we use a theory of discourse
interpretation called SDRT (Asher and Lascarides,
2003). This theory attempts to enrich dynamic se-
mantics with techniques for encoding the contribu-
tion of pragmatics. One central notion of dynamic
semantics (eg. (Kamp and Reyle, 1993)) is the up-
date of a representation of the context with that of
new information; in SDRT, this update is depend-
ent on non-monotonic inferences over linguistic
and non-linguistic information. SDRT?s update-
operation is defined on descriptions like MRSs;
it simply adds constraints on the form of logical
forms. The inferred information that is most im-
portant for us is the speech act type (e.g. QAP,
Elab
pp
) that connects the new information to the
context; this is what we used to classify fragments
in Section 2.
These speech acts are computed via default rules;
to give an example, the rule for IQAP is shown be-
low. In this rules, ??, ?, ?? means ? is to be attached
to ? with a rhetorical relation (? and ? label bits of
content) where ? is part of the discourse context ? ;
? :? means that ? is an interrogative, and A > B
means If A then normally B:13
(9) IQAP: (?; ; ? ?  :?) > IQAP(; )
This rule stipulates that the default contribution of a
response to a question is to supply information from
which the questioner can infer an answer. Thus in-
ferences about speech acts, and hence about impli-
cit content and goals, can sometime be triggered (by
default) purely on the basis of sentence moods. For
13(Asher and Lascarides, 1998) shows that some rules
like this can be derived from a precise model of rational-
ity and cooperativity.
other speech acts, information about speaker-goals
might be required; however, the general principle is
to always minimise the need for such information.
We now address resolving the underspecification
indicated by unknown rel. In particular, we argue
that there are certain constraints on the form of
resolution-via-identity fragments which do not ap-
ply to resolution-via-inference fragments. We de-
rive these different constraints from a general dis-
course coherence principle, but before we come to
this, we have to show what these constraints are.
We begin with questions and answers like (1).
Intuitively, one can say that there is a ?hole? in
questions like (1) or (10), marked syntactically by
the wh-phrase and semantically by a variable (be
that bound by a ?-operator, as in (Groenendijk and
Stokhof, 1984) or by a quantifier, as in the ERG).
(10) A: Who came to the party?
B: Not Sandy.
This initially suggests that to resolve the content of
the fragment, one could attempt to do syntactic re-
construction, ?plugging? the syntactic structure of
the fragment into the (syntactic) ?hole? in the ques-
tion (cf. (Morgan, 1973)). Unfortunately, as (Gin-
zburg and Sag, 2001) (henceforth G&S) attest, such
a strategy fails for some cases; eg. for (10) above:
?*Not Sandy came to the party.?
On the other hand, G&S also attest that a purely
semantic reconstruction, where the semantic rep-
resentation of the fragment is ?plugged into? the
(semantic) ?hole? in the question, is also unsatis-
factory. Certain grammatical idiosyncrasies seem
to persist beyond sentence boundaries. This can
be shown with example (11) (from G&S, p.300).
Here the fragmental answers must be of the syn-
tactic category required by the verb in the question
(VP[bse] and VP[inf ], respectively), even though
the semantic objects denoted by these VPs presum-
ably are of the same type.14
(11) a. A: What did he make you do? ? B: Sing
b. A: What did he force you to do? ? B: To
sing.
G&S model this constraint by restricting short an-
swers to be syntactically parallel to the question
they answer. This however is too strict, as ex-
amples like (2) show, which is a short answer as
well but does not exhibit such ?parallelism?. We
explain the observation in a less direct but more
14For a further discussion of the exact extent of this
parallelism see (Schlangen, 2002).
general way. First of all, our theory is declarat-
ive: it describes the form of the preferred resolu-
tion (it?s the one that satisfies the coherence con-
straints of the rhetorical relations), but not neces-
sarily how it is generated. We assume as a gen-
eral discourse principle that resolutions which are
(semantic-)structurally very close must satisfy a
certain syntactic constraint which says that sub-
categorization requirements must be satisfied, too.
Hence our principle can rule out resolutions even if
they satisfy the semantic constraints (eg., it would
rule out the ?wrong? combination of questions and
answers in (11) above), in case they violate that syn-
tactic constraint. The difference between (1) and
(2) now is explained by different contextual require-
ments. In (2) there is another relation present be-
sides QAP, namely Explanation. The semantics of
this former relation (namely that ? explains the pro-
positional content of ?) puts additional semantic
constraints on the answer; the structural closeness
is not required, and hence the fragment is exempt
from the syntactic constraint.
For reasons of space, we simply sketch the the-
ory here, but we should stress that, following G&S,
we also assume that certain syntactic information
persists beyond sentence boundaries.
5.2 Implementation
We have partially implemented the theory described
here in a computer program (see also (Schlangen
and Lascarides, 2002)). The resolution of res-via-
id fragments is very straightforward to implement,
since for them all possibilities can be generated via
simple abstraction and functional application oper-
ations over the semantic representations. That of
res-via-inf fragments is more problematic, and we
have only implemented it for a very limited domain,
namely that of scheduling dialogues. In this do-
main, the discourse-plans are particularly simple,
and so we can specify the required axioms for reas-
oning with extra-linguistic information. Again we
can?t go into details here and only note that even
though we minimise the amount of extra-linguistic
information that is needed, resolution of res-via-inf
fragments is a demanding task and can be auto-
mated only for very restricted domains.
6 Related Work
The idea that content is determined by coherence
relations is of course not new, and has been imple-
mented for example in (Hobbs et al, 1993), which
also mentions in passing the problem of resolving
fragments in context. However, this ?Interpreta-
tion as Abduction?-theory (IAT) differs from our ap-
proach in a number of important aspects. First, un-
like IAT?s weighted abduction where conflict among
the clues to interpretation is handled by the ex-
traneous logical machinery of weights, in our the-
ory conflict is resolved automatically by the logical
consequence relation itself. Secondly, Hobbs et al
don?t consider the syntactic constraints on the resol-
ution of fragments that we discussed above. In fact,
they seem to regard fragments as ?syntactically-ill
formed utterances?, and so do not make a difference
between well-formed and ill-formed fragments. In
principle, further constraints could be added to the
ITA framework, but at the cost of having to re-assign
weights so that the results of inference are always as
intended, and no princples or regulations are given
in (Hobbs et al, 1993) about how to do this.
As mentioned in the introduction, (Ginzburg
and Sag, 2001) (henceforth G&S) also offer a
non-modular approach to the resolution of short-
answers (and some other fragmental speech acts).
(12) shows a very schematic representation of their
approach.

A grammar rule specific to the use made of the frag-
ment (in (12) as an answer) directly projects NPs as
sentences, with parts of the sentential content com-
ing from a contextual feature QUD (question under
discussion). This grammar rule in one go checks
the syntactic constraints and constructs the intended
content of the fragment in its discourse context.
In our opinion, our compositional approach has
certain advantages. First, the grammatical analysis
of fragments is uniform; contextual variation in
their meaning is accounted for in the same way as
it is for other anaphoric phenomena, via inferences
underlying discourse update. This yields the second
advantage: resolving fragments is fully integrated
with resolving other kinds of underspecification (al-
though we have not shown this here; cf. (Schlan-
gen and Lascarides, 2002)). Third, the interac-
tion between grammar and pragmatics is straight-
forward: pragmatics enriches information coming
from the grammar. In G&S?s approach the grammar
has to ?decide? on the speech act that has been per-
formed (the grammar-rules are specific for eg. an-
swering, clarification); something that is normally
seen to be a defeasible process. Hence, even in
G&S?s approach a pragmatic module is required,
which then has the task of filtering out unwanted
parses. Fourth, we have available a strong theory
of contextual interpretation which can explain the
reasoning behind the resolution of examples like (2)
(although we have not shown here in detail how);
the functional application used by G&S seems too
weak to do this. Fifth, our compositional approach
allowed us to straightforwardly extend an existing
wide-coverage grammar. This contrasts with the
non-compositional approach which through its de-
mands for making contextual information available
entails that standard parsers cannot be used without
modifications. Lastly, the separation of the gram-
mar and resolution components means that in the-
ory our grammar can be used with different resolu-
tion strategies; however, we have not systematically
explored that.
As mentioned in the introduction, (Carberry,
1990) offers an approach that uses plan-recognition
techniques to resolve fragments. While such an
approach can perhaps model res-via-inf cases, it
seems to us needlessy powerful for fragment-types
like (1), where purely linguistic information is suf-
ficient. Moreover, Carberry does not deal with the
syntactic constraints and so overgenerates possible
fragments.
7 Conclusions
We draw the following conclusions from the work
presented in this paper: fragments occur frequently
in dialogues, namely relatively consistently around
10% across dialogue types (but possibly more fre-
quently in question/answer-based informative dia-
logues). This means that a principled approach to
their resolution is important for natural sounding
dialogue systems, besides being of theoretical in-
terest. We have offered such an approach, begin-
ning with a comprehensive taxonomy of fragment-
types, through to a semantic and syntactic analysis,
which we also implemented. In that implementa-
tion we identified for future work the sub-type of
fragments of the form ?CONJ XP? (eg. ?and on
Monday.?).
