Abstract 
Most existing anaphora resolution algo- 
rithms are designed to account only for 
anaphors with NP-antecedents. This paper 
describes an algorithm for the resolution of 
discourse deictic anaphors, which constitute 
a large percentage ofanaphors in spoken di- 
alogues. The success of the resolution is 
dependent on the classification of all pro- 
nouns and demonstratives into individual, 
discourse deictic and vague anaphora. Fi- 
nally, the empirical results of the application 
of the algorithm to a corpus of spoken dia- 
logues are presented. 
1 Introduction 
Most anaphora resolution algorithms are designed to 
deal with the co-indexing relation between anaphors 
and NP-antecedents. In the spoken language corpus 
we examined - the Switchboard corpus of telephone 
conversations (LDC, 1993) - this type of link only 
accounts for 45.1% of all anaphoric references. An- 
other 22.6% are anaphors whose referents are not in- 
dividual, concrete ntities but events, facts and propo- 
sitions, e.g., 
(1) B.7: 
A.8: 
\[We never know what they're thinking\]/. 
Thati's right. \[I don't trust hem\]j, 
maybe I guess itj's because of what 
happened over there with their own 
people, how they threw them out of 
power. (sw3241) 
Whilst there have been attempts to classify abstract 
objects and the rules governing anaphoric reference to
them (Webber, 1991; Asher, 1993; Dahl and Hellman, 
1995), there have been no exhaustive, mpirical stud- 
ies using actual resolution algorithms. These have so 
far only been applied to written corpora. However, 
the high frequency of abstract object anaphora in dia- 
logues means that any attempt to resolve anaphors in 
spoken language cannot succeed without aking this 
into account. 
Summarised below are some issues specific to 
anaphora resolution in spoken dialogues (see also 
Byron and Stent (1998) who mention some of these 
problems in their account of the Centering model 
(Grosz et al, 1995)). 
Center of attention in multi-party discourse. In 
spontaneous speech it is possible that the participants 
of a dialogue may not be focussing on the same entity 
at a given point in the discourse. 
Utterances with no discourse entities. E.g., Uh- 
huh; yeah; right. Byron and Stent (1998) and 
Walker (1998) assign no importance tosuch utterances 
in their models. We assume that hese also can be used 
to acknowledge a preceding utterance. 
Abandoned or partial utterances. Speakers may in- 
terrupt each other or make speech repairs, e.g., 
(2) Uh, our son/has this kind of, you know, he/'s, 
well hei started out going Stephen F Austin 
(sw3117) 
Self-corrected speech cannot be ignored as can be 
seen by the fact that the entity referred to by the NP 
our son is subsequently referred to by a pronoun and 
must therefore have entered the discourse model. 
Determination of utterance boundaries. Most 
anaphor resolution algorithms rely on a syntactic def- 
inition of utterance which cannot be provided by spo- 
ken dialogue as there is no punctuation tomark com- 
plete sentences. 
These issues are dealt with by our method of segment- 
ing dialogues into dialogue acts with specified dis- 
course functions. In addition, our approach presents 
a simple classification of individual and abstract ob- 
ject anaphors and uses separate algorithms for each 
class. We build on the recall rate of state-of-the-art 
pronoun resolution algorithms but we achieve a far 
higher precision than would be achieved by applying 
these to spoken language because the classification of 
37 
Proceedings of EACL '99 
anaphors prevents the algorithm from co-indexing dis- 
course deictic anaphora with individual antecedents. 
Section 2 gives definitions and frequency of occur- 
rence of the different anaphor types. Section 3 de- 
scribes the segmentation f the dialogues into dialogue 
acts and the influence of these on the entities in the 
discourse model. Section 4 presents the method we 
use for resolving anaphors and the corresponding al- 
gorithm. In Section 5, we report on the corpus anno- 
tation and the evaluation of the algorithm. 
2 Anaphor Types in Dialogues 
In the dialogues examined, only 45.1% of the anaphors 
are individual anaphors, i.e., anaphors with NP- 
antecedents (IPro, IDem), e.g., 
(3) Boeing ought to hire himi and give him/ a 
junkyardj . . . .  and see if hei could build a 
Seven Forty-Seven out of itj. (sw2102) 
22.6% of the anaphors are discourse deictic, i.e. 
co-specify with non-NP constituents such as VPs, sen- 
tences, strings of sentences (DDPro, DDDem; cf. 
Webber (1991)). The phenomenon of discourse de- 
ictic anaphora in written texts has been shown to be 
strongly dependent on discourse structure. As can also 
be seen in the examples below, anaphoric reference is
restricted to elements adjacent o the utterance con- 
taining the anaphor, i.e., those on the right frontier 
of the discourse structure tree (Webber, 1991; Asher, 
1993): 
(4) A.46: \[The government don't tell you 
everything.\]i 
B.47: I knowit/ 
(sw3241) 
(5) Now why didn't she \[take him over there with 
her\]i? No, she didn't do thati. 
(sw4877) 
The existence of abstract object anaphora shows 
that aside from individual entities, the discourse model 
may also contain complex, higher-order ntities. One 
of the differences between individual and discourse 
deictic anaphora is that whereas a concrete NP an- 
tecedent usually only refers to the individual it de- 
scribes, a sentence may simultaneously denote an 
eventuality, a concept, a proposition and a fact. 
Instead of assuming that all levels of abstract ob- 
jects are introduced to the discourse model by the sen- 
tence that makes them available, it has been suggested 
that anaphoric discourse deictic reference involves ref- 
erent coercion (Webber, 1991; Asher, 1993; Dahl and 
Hellman, 1995). This assumption is further justified 
by the fact that discourse deictic reference, as opposed 
to individual anaphoric reference, is often established 
38 
by demonstratives rather than pronouns. In theories 
relating cognitive status and choice of NP-form (cf. 
Gundel et al (1993)), pronouns are only available for 
the most salient entities, whereas demonstratives can 
be used to shift the focus of attention to a different en- 
tity. 
A further 19.1% of anaphors are Inferrable- 
Evoked Pronouns (IEPro) and constitute a particular 
type of plural pronoun which indirectly co-specifies 
with a singular antecedent. This group includes exis- 
tential, generic and corporate 3rd person plural pro- 
nouns (Jaeggli, 1986; Belletti and Rizzi, 1988). 
(6) I think the Soviet Union knows what we have 
and knows that we're pretty serious and if they 
ever tried to do anything, we would, we would 
be on the offensive. (sw3241) 
In (6), the NP Soviet Union can be associated with 
inferrables uch as the population or the government. 
These can subsequently be referred to by pronouns 
without having been explicitly mentioned themselves. 
In some cases of IEPro's there is no associated NP, as 
in the following example, where the speaker is refer- 
ring to the organisers of the Switchboard calls: 
(7) this is the first call I 've done \[...\] and, I didn't 
realize that they ha-, were going to reach 
out to people from \[...\] all over the country. 
(sw2041) 
13.2% of the anaphors are vague (VagPro, Vag- 
Dem), in the sense that they refer to the general topic 
of conversation and, as opposed to discourse deic- 
tic anaphors, do not have a specific clause as an an- 
tecedent, e.g., 
(8) B.29: I mean, the baby is like seventeen 
months and she just screams. 
A.30: Uh-huh. 
B.31 : Well even if she knows that they're 
fixing to get ready to go over there. 
They're not even there yet - 
A.32: Uh-huh. 
B.33: -you  know. 
A.34: Yeah. It's hard. 
Non-referring pronouns, or expletives, were not 
marked. These include subjects of weather verbs, 
those in raising verb constructions or those occurring 
in sentences with extraposed sentential subjects or ob- 
jects, e.g., 
(9) It's hard to realize, that there are places that 
are just so, uh, bare on the shelves as there. 
(sw2403) 
This group also contains the various ubcategorised 
expletives (Postal and Pullum, 1988), defined as being 
non-referring pronouns in argument positions, e.g., 
Proceedings of EACL '99 
(10) Uh, they don't need somebody else coming in 
and saying, you know, okay we're going to be 
with them and we're going to zap it to you. 
(sw2403) 
(11) When it comes to trucks, though, I would 
probably think to go American. (sw2326) 
They differ from referring anaphors in that they 
cannot be questioned (e.g., *When what comes to 
trucks ?). 
3 Synchronising Units 
The domain which contains potential antecedents i  
not given in syntactic terms in spoken dialogue. Hence 
we define this domain in pragmatic terms. We assume 
that discourse ntities enter the joint discourse model 
and are available for subsequent reference when com- 
mon ground between the discourse participants i es- 
tablished. Our model builds on the observation that 
certain dialogue acts - in particular acknowledgments 
- signal that common ground is achieved. Our as- 
sumptions are based on Clark's (1989) theory of con- 
tributions (cf. also Traum (1994)). 
Each dialogue is divided into short, clearly de- 
fined dialogue acts - Initiations I and Acknowledg- 
ments A - based on the top of the hierarchy given 
in Carletta et al (1997). Each sentence and each con- 
joined clause counts as a separate I, even if they are 
part of the same turn. A's do not convey semantic on- 
tent but have a pragmatic function (e.g., backchannel). 
In addition there are utterances which function as an 
A but also have semantic ontent - these are labelled 
as A/I. 
A single I is paired with an A and they jointly form 
a Synchronising Unit (SU). In longer turns, each main 
clause functions as a separate unit along with its sub- 
ordinate clauses. Single I 's constitute SU's by them- 
selves and do not require explicit acknowledgment. 
The assumption is that by letting the speaker continue, 
the hearer implicitly acknowledges the utterance. It is 
only in the context of turn-taking that I's and A's are 
paired up. 
Our model is based on the observation that com- 
mon ground has an influence on attentional state. We 
assume that only entities in a complete SU are en- 
tered into the common ground and remain in the S- 
list for the duration of a further SU. If one speaker's I 
is not acknowledged by the other participant i cannot 
be included in an SU. In this case the discourse nti- 
ties mentioned in the unacknowledged I are added to 
the S-List but are immediately deleted again when the 
subsequent I clearly shows that they are not part of the 
common ground. 
Figure 1 below, taken from the Trains-corpus 
(speakers  and u) illustrates that a missing acknowl- 
39 
edgment prevents the discourse model from contain- 
ing discourse ntities from the unacknowledged turn. 
SUi I s: so there- the five boxcars of oranges 
<sil> + that are at- + 
S-List: \[5 boxcars of oranges\] 
SUj A/I u: +at <sil> +atComing 
S-List: \[5 boxcars of oranges, Coming\] 
A s: urn 
- I u: okay the orange warehouse <sil> urn 
I + have to + 
S-List: \[Coming, orange warehouse\] 
SUk I S: yOU need + you need to get five <sil> 
five boxcars of oranges there 
S-List: \[Coming, 5 boxcars of oranges\] 
A u: uh 
SOt I no they're are already waiting for me 
there 
(d92a-4.3) 
Figure 1: Unacknowledged Turns 
Speaker u's second turn is an I which is not fol- 
lowed by an A. This means that the entity referred to 
in that utterance (orange warehouse) is immediately 
removed from the joint discourse model. Thus there 
in the final two turns co-specifies with Coming and 
not the most recent orange warehouse. 
4 How to Resolve Discourse Deictic 
Anaphora 
We now turn to our method of anaphora reso- 
lution, which extends the algorithm presented in 
Strube (1998), in order to be able to account for 
discourse deictic anaphora as well as individual 
anaphora. 
4.1 Anaphor-anteeedent Compatibi l i ty 
As indicated in Section 2, information provided by 
the subcategorisation frame of the anaphor's predicate 
can be used to determine the type of the referent. In 
the algorithm, we make use of the notion of anaphor- 
antecedent Compatibility to distinguish between dis- 
course deictic and individual reference. Certain pred- 
icates (notably verbs of propositional ttitude) require 
one of their arguments o have a referent whose mean- 
ing is correlated with sentences, e.g., is true, assume 
(referred to as SC-bias verbs in Garnsey et al (1997) 
and elsewhere). Pronouns in these positions rarely 
have concrete individual NP-antecedents and are gen- 
erally only compatible with discourse deictic refer- 
ents. Other argument positions are preferentially as- 
sociated with concrete individuals (e.g., objects of eat, 
smell) (DO-bias verbs). A summary of these predicate 
types is provided in Figure 2, where l-incompatible

I-Incompatible (*I) 
Equating constructions where a pronominal referent 
is equated with an abstract object, e.g., x is making 
it easy, x is a suggestion. 
Copula constructions whose adjectives can only be 
applied to abstract entities, e.g., x is true, x is false, 
x is correct, x is right, x isn't right. 
? Arguments of verbs describing propositional atti- 
tude which only take S'-complements, e.g., assume. 
? Object of do. 
? Predicate or anaphoric referent is a "reason", e.g., x 
is because I like her, x is why he ' s late. 
A-Incompatible (*A) 
Equating constructions where a pronominal referent 
is equated with a concrete individual referent, e.g., x 
is a car. 
Copula constructions whose adjectives can only be 
applied to concrete ntities, e.g., x is expensive, x is 
tasty, x is loud. 
Arguments of verbs describing physical con- 
tact/stimulation, which cannot be used metaphori- 
cally, e.g., break x, smash x, eat x, drink x, smell x 
but NOT *see x 
Figure 2: I-Incompatibility and A-Incompatibility 
means preferentially associated with abstract objects 
and A-incompatible means preferentially associated 
with individual objects 1. Anaphors which are argu- 
ment positions of the first type are classified as dis- 
course deictic (DDPro; DDDem), those in argument 
positions of the second type are classified as individ- 
ual anaphora (IPro; IDem). 
It is clear that predicate information alone is not suf- 
ficient for this purpose as there is a large group of 
verbs which allow both individual and discourse de- 
ictic referents (e.g., objects of see, know) (EQ-bias 
verbs). In these cases the preference is determined by 
NP-form of the anaphor (pronoun vs. demonstrative). 
4.2 Types of Abstract Antecedents 
We follow Asher (1993) in assuming that the predicate 
of a discourse deictic anaphor determines the type of 
abstract object. An anaphor in the object position of 
the verb do, for example, can only have a VP (event- 
concept) antecedent (eg John \[sang\]. Bill did that 
too.), whereas an anaphor in the subject position of 
the predicate is true requires a full S (proposition) (eg 
\[John sang\]. That 's  true.). This verbal subcategorisa- 
tion information is used to determine which part of the 
preceding I is required to form the correct referent. 
Following Webber and others, we assume that an 
abstract object is only introduced to the discourse 
model by the anaphor itself. In addition to the S-List 
(Strube, 1998), which contains the referents of NPs 
available for anaphoric reference, our model includes 
~These are preferences and not strict rules because some 
l-Incompatible contexts are compatible with NPs denoting 
abstract objects, e.g., The story/It is true. and NPs which 
are used to stand elliptically for an event or state, e.g., His 
car/It is the reason why he's late. This shows that predicate 
compatibility must ultimately be defined in semantic terms 
and not just rely on syntactic strings (NP vs. S). 
40 
an A-List for abstract objects. This is only filled if dis- 
course deictic pronouns or demonstratives occur and 
its contents remain only for one I, which is necessary 
for multiple discourse deictic reference to the same en- 
tity. 
The following context ranking describes the order in 
which the parts of the linguistic context are accessed: 
1. A-List (containing abstract objects previously re- 
ferred to anaphorically). 
2. Within same I: Clause to the left of the clause 
containing the anaphor. 
3. Within previous I: Rightmost main clause (and 
subordinated clauses to its right). 
4. Within previous rs :  Rightmost complete sen- 
tence (if previous I is incomplete sentence). 
Figure 3: Context Ranking 
4.3 The Algorithm 
The algorithm consists of two branches, one for the 
resolution of pronouns, the other for the resolution of 
demonstratives. Both of them call the functions re- 
solveDD and resolvelnd, which resolve discourse de- 
ictic anaphora nd individual anaphora, respectively. 
If a pronoun is encountered (Figure 4, below), the 
functions resolveDD or resolvelnd (described below) 
are evaluated, depending on whether the pronoun is I- 
incompatible (1) or A-incompatible (2). In the case of 
success the pronouns are classified as DDPro or lPro, 
respectively. In the case of failure, the pronouns are 
classified as VagPro. If the pronoun is neither I- nor 
A-incompatible (i.e., the pronoun is ambiguous in this 
respect), the classification is only dependent on the 
Proceedings of EACL '99

then if resolveDD(PRO) 
then classify as DDPro

then classify as IPro 
else classify as VagPro

then classify as IPro 
4. else if resolveDD(PRO) 
then classify as DDPro

success of the resolution. The function resolvelnd is 
evaluated first (3) because of the observed preference 
for individual antecedents for pronouns,. If success- 
ful, the pronoun is classified as IPro, if unsuccessful, 
the function resolveDD attempts to resolve the pro- 
noun (4). If this, in turn, is successful, the pronoun is 
classified as DDPro, if it is unsuccessful it is classi- 
fied as VagPro, indicating that the pronoun cannot be 
resolved using the linguistic context. 
The procedure is similar in the case of demonstra- 
fives (Figure 5, below). The only difference being that 
the antecedent of a demonstrative is preferentially an 
abstract object. The order of (3) and (4) is therefore 
reversed. 
We now turn to the function resolveDD (Figure 6, 
below) (assuming that resolvelnd resolves individual 
anaphora nd returns true or false depending on its 
success). In step (1) the function resolveDD examines 
all elements of the context ranking (Figure 3) until the 
function co-index succeeds, which evaluates whether 
the element is of the right type. Then the function 
resolveDD returns true. If the pronoun is an argu- 
ment of "do", the function co-index is tried on the VP 
of the current element of the context ranking (2). If 
successful, the VP-referent is added to the A-List and 
the function returns true. In (3), co-index evaluates 
whether the pronoun and the current element of the 
context ranking are compatible. In the case of a posi- 
tive result, the element is added to the A-List and true 
is returned. If all elements of the context ranking are 
resolveDD(PRO) := 
1. foreach element of context ranking do 
2. if (PRO is argument of do) 
then if (co-index PRO with VP of element) 
then add VP to A-List; return true 
3. else if (co-index PRO with element) 
then add element to A-List; return true 
4. return false. 
Figure 6: resolveDD 
41 
checked without success, resolveDD returns false (4). 
Example 12 illustrates the algorithm: 
(12) B.8: I mean, if went and policed, just like 
you say, every country when they had 
squabbles, 
A.9: Well, 
but we've done it before, 
B.10: Oh, 
I know we have. 
A. 11 : and it has not been successful. 
(sw2403) 
When the pronoun "it" in A.9 is encountered, 
the algorithm determines the pronoun to be I- 
incompatible (Step 1 in Figure 4), as it is the object 
argument of the verb do. The function resolveDD is 
evaluated. The A-List is empty, so the highest ranked 
element in the context ranking is the last complete sen- 
tence in B.8. The pronoun is an argument of "do", 
therefore gets co-indexed with the VP-referent of the 
sentence in B.8. The VP is added to the A-List, the 
function returns true and the pronoun is classified as 
DDPro by the algorithm. 
When the next pronoun is encountered, the A- 
List is empty again because of the intervening sen- 
tence (I) in B.10. The pronoun is neither I- nor 
A-incompatible, therefore the algorithm evaluates re- 
solvelnd (step 3). This fails, since there are no indi- 
vidual antecedents available in B. 10 and the algorithm 
evaluates resolveDD in the step (4). The first element 
in the context ranking is the main clause in A. 11 which 
is co-indexed with the pronoun. The clause-referent 
is added to the A-List, the function returns true and 
the algorithm classifies the pronoun as DDPro. In this 
case, the classification is correct but not the resolution, 
since the pronoun should co-specify with the pronoun 
in A.9. 
5 Empi r i ca l  Eva luat ion  
In order to test the hypotheses made in the previous 
sections we performed an empirical evaluation on nat- 
Proceedings ofEACL '99 
urally occurring dialogues. First, the corpus was an- 
notated for all relevant features, i.e., division of turns 
into dialogue act units, classification of dialogue acts 
(I, A), marking of noun phrases, classification of the 
various types of anaphors introduced in Section 2, and 
annotating coreference between anaphors and individ- 
ual/abstract discourse ntities. The last step provided 
the key for the test of the algorithm described in Sec- 
tion 4.3. 
5.1 Annotation 
Our data consisted of five randomly selected dia- 
logues from the Switchboard corpus of spoken tele- 
phone conversations (LDC, 1993). Two dialogues 
(SW2041, SW4877) were used to train the two annota- 
tors (the authors), and three further dialogues for test- 
ing (SW2403, SW3117, SW3241). The training dia- 
logues were used for improving the annotation manual 
and for clarifying the annotation i  borderline cases. 
After each step the annotations were compared us- 
ing the ~ statistic as reliability measure for all classifi- 
cation tasks (Carletta, 1996). A t~ of 0.68 < ~ < 0.80 
allows tentative conclusions while ~ > 0.80 indicates 
reliability between the annotators. In the following ta- 
bles, the rows on above the horizontal line show how 
often a particular class was actually marked as such by 
both annotators. In the rows below the line, N shows 
the total number of markables, while Z gives the num- 
ber of agreements between the annotations. PA is per- 
cent agreement between the annotators, PE expected 
agreement by chance. Finally, ~ is computed by the 
formula PA - PE /1  - PE .  
Dialogue Acts. First, turns were segmented into di- 
alogue act units. We turned the segmentation task into 
a classification task by using boundaries between di- 
alogue acts as one class and non-boundaries a  the 
other (see Passonneau and Litman (1997) for a simi- 
lar practice). In Table l, Non-Bound. and Bound. give 
the number of non-boundaries and boundaries actu- 
ally marked by the annotators, N is the total number 
of possible boundary sites, while Z gives the number 
of agreements between the annotations.

and no dialogue act (No). For this test we used only 
these dialogue act units which the annotators agreed 
about. PA was 92.6%, ~ = 0.87 again indicating that 
it is possible to annotate these classes reliably.

with their antecedents. For this task we cannot pro- 
vide reliability scores using n because it is not a clas- 
sification task. It is much more difficult than the 
previous ones, as the problem consists of identifying 
the correct beginning and end of the string which co- 
specifies with the anaphor. We used only the abstract 
anaphors whose classification both annotators agreed 
upon. The annotators then marked the antecedents and 
co-indexed them with the anaphors. The results were 
compared and the annotators agreed upon a reconciled 
version of the data. Annotator accuracy was then mea- 
sured against the reconciled version. Accuracy ranged 
from 85,7% (Annotator A) to 94,3% (Annotator B).

Table 6: Results of the Discourse Deictic Anaphora 
Algorithm 
The low value for precision indicates that the classi- 
fication did not perform very well. Of the 28 anaphors 
resolved incorrectly, only 11 were classified correctly. 
One of the most common errors in classification was, 
that an anaphor annotated as vague (VagPro, VagDem) 
was classified by the algorithm as discourse deictic 
(DDPro, DDDem). Classification is dependent on res- 
olution, so since the context almost always provides an 
antecedent for a discourse deictic anaphor, it is possi- 
ble to classify and resolve avague anaphor incorrectly, 
as in Example 13: 
(13) A: \[I don't know\]/ , I think it/ really depends 
a lot on the child.

6 Comparison to Related Work 
Both Webber(1991) and Asher (1993) describe the 
phenomenon of abstract object anaphora nd present 
restrictions on the set of potential antecedents. They 
do not, however, concern themselves with the problem 
of how to classify a certain pronoun or demonstrative 
as individual or abstract. Also, as they do not give 
preferences on the set of potential candidates, their 
approaches are not intended as attempts to resolve ab- 
stract object anaphora. 
Concerning anaphora resolution in dialogues, only 
little research as been carried out in this area to our 
knowledge. LuperFoy (1992) does not present a cor- 
pus study, meaning that statistics about he distribution 
of individual and abstract object anaphora or about 
the success rate of her approach are not available. 
Byron and Stent (1998) present extensions of the cen- 
tering model (Grosz et al, 1995) for spoken dialogue 
and identify several problems with the model. We 
have chosen Strube's (1998) model for the resolution 
of individual anaphora s basis because it avoids the 
problems encountered by Byron & Stent, who also do 
not present data on the resolution of pronouns in dia- 
logues and do not mention abstract object anaphora. 
Dagan and Itai (1991) describe a corpus-based ap- 
proach to the resolution of pronouns, which is evalu- 
ated for the neuter pronoun "it". Again, abstract ob- 
ject anaphora are not mentioned. 
7 Conclusions and Future Work 
In this paper we presented a method for resolving ab- 
stract object anaphora in spoken language. We con- 
sider our approach to be a first step towards the un- 
constrained resolution of anaphora in dialogue. 
The results of our method show that the recall is 
fairly high while the precision is relatively low. This 
indicates that the anaphor classification requires im- 
provement, in particular the notion of Compatibility. 
Lists of verb biases for sentential and NP comple- 
ments, as described in psycholinguistic studies (e.g. 
Garnsey et al (1997)), could be used to classify verbs. 
Currently exisiting lists only account for a small num- 
ber of verbs but there may be the possibility of adding 
statistical information from large corpora of spoken 
dialogue. 
Furthermore, the algorithm currently ignores ab- 
stract NPs (e.g., story, exercising) when looking for 
antecedents for anaphors with 1-incompatible predi- 
cates. We are considering determining the feature ab- 
stract for all NPs in order to identify those which can 
act as antecedents in such contexts. 
Information such as this could be used by the algo- 
rithm to prevent the anaphor classification from being 
dependent on anaphor resolution.
