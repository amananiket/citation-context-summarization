Abstract 
The EUTRANS project, aims at devel- 
oping Machine Translation systems for 
limited domain applications. These sys- 
tems accept speech and text input, and 
are trained using an example based ap- 
proach. The translation model used in 
this project is the Subsequential Trans- 
ducer, which is easily integrable in con- 
ventional speech recognition systems. In 
addition, Subsequential Transducers can 
be automatically learned from corpora. 
This paper describes the use of categories 
for improving the EUTRANS translation 
systems. Experimental results with the 
task defined in the project show that this 
approach reduces the number of exam- 
ples required for achieving ood models. 
1 I n t roduct ion  
The EUTRANS project 1(Amengual et al, 1996a), 
funded by the European Union, aims at develop- 
ing Machine Translation systems for limited do- 
main applications. These systems accept speech 
and text input, and are trained using an ex- 
ample based approach. The translation model 
used in this project is the Subsequential Trans- 
ducer (SST), which is easily integrable in con- 
ventional speech recognition systems by using it 
both as language and translation model (Jimdnez 
et al, 1995). In addition, SSTs can be automati- 
cally learned from sentence aligned bilingual cor- 
pora (Oncina et ai., 1993). 
This paper describes the use of categories both 
in the training and translation processes for im- 
proving the EUTRANS translation systems. The

approach presented here improves that in (Vilar 
et al, 1995), the integration of categories within 
the systems i simpler, and it allows for categories 
grouping units larger than a word. Experimental 
results with the Traveler Task, defined in (Amen- 
gual et al, 1996b), show that this method reduces 
the number of examples required for achieving 
good models. 
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. 
In section 2 some basic concepts and the notation 
are introduced. The technique used for integrat- 
ing categories inthe system is detailed in section 3. 
Section 4 presents the speech translation system. 
Both speech and text input experiments are de- 
scribed in section 5. Finally, section 6 presents 
some conclusions and new directions. 
2 Basic Concepts  -r id Notat ion  
Given an alphabet X, X* is the free monoid of 
strings over X. The symbol A represents the 
empty string, first letters (a, b, c, . . . )  rep- 
resent individual symbols of the alphabets and 
last letters (z, y, x, . . . )  represent strings of 
the free monoids. We refer to the individual el- 
ements of the strings by means of subindices, as 
in x = a l . . .an .  Given two strings x ,y  E X ' ,  xy 
denotes the concatenation f x and y. 
2.1 Subsequential  Transducers 
A Subsequential Transducer (Berstel, 1979) is a 
deterministic f nite state network that accepts en- 
tences from a given input language and produces 
associated sentences of an output language. A 
SST is composed of states and arcs. Each arc 
connects two states and it is associated to an in- 
put symbol and an output substring (that may 
be empty). Translation of an input sentence is 
obtained starting from the initial state, follow- 
ing the path corresponding to its symbols through 
the network, and concatenating the corresponding 
output substrings. 
44 
Formally, a SST is a tuple r = (X, Y, Q, q0, 
E, o-) where X and 1," are the input and output 
alphabets, Q is a finite set of states, qo E Q is 
the initial state, E E Q x X x Y" x ~ is a set 
of arcs satisfying the determinism condition, and 
a : Q ~ Y" is a state emission function 2. Those 
states for which o" is defined are usually called final 
states. The determinism condition means that, if 
(p, a. y, q) and (p, a, y', q') belong to E, then y = y' 
andq=q' .  Given as t r ingx  = a l . . .an  E X ' ,  a 
sequence (qo~al,yl,ql) . . . .  , (qn-l,a,~,yn,q,~) is a 
valid path if (qi-1, ai, Yi, qi) belongs to E for every 
i in 1 , . . . ,  n, and qn is a final state. In case there 
exists such a valid path for z, the translation of 
z by r is y l . . .  yna(q~). Otherwise, the transla- 
tion is undefined. Note that due to the condition 
of determinism, there can be no more than one 
valid path, and hence at most one translation, for 
a given input string. Therefore, r defines a func- 
tion between an input language, Lt C_ X ?, and 
an output language, Lo C Y*. Both Lt and Lo 
are regular languages and their corresponding au- 
tomata re easily obtainable from the SST. In par- 
ticular, an automaton for Lt can be obtained by 
eliminating the output of the arcs and states, and 
considering the final state set of the automaton 
being the same as in the SST. A state is useless if 
it is not contained in any valid path. Useless tates 
can be eliminated from a SST without changing 
the function it defines. 
In section 3, we will relax the model. Instead 
of imposing the determinism conditition, we will 
only enforce the existence of at most one valid 
path in the transducer for each input string (non- 
ambiguity). We will call them Unambiguous SSTs 
(USSTs). Standard algorithms for finding the 
path corresponding to a string in an unambigous 
finite state automaton (see for instance (Hopcroft 
and UNman, 1979)) can be used for finding the 
translation in a USST. When the problem is the 
search for the best path in the expanded model 
during speech translation (see section 4), the use 
of the Viterbi algorithm (Forney, 1973) guarantees 
that the most likely path will be found. 
2.2 In ference  of  Subsequent ia l  
T ransducers  
The use of SSTs to model limited domain trans- 
lation tasks has the distinctive advantage of al- 
lowing an automatic and efficient learning of the 
translation models from sets of examples. An in- 
ference algorithm known as OSTIA (Onward Sub- 
21n this paper, the term function refers to partial 
functions. We will use f(z) = @ to denote that the 
function .f is undefined for ~. 
sequential Transducer Inference Algorithm) allows 
the obtainment of a SST that correctly models the 
translation of a given task, if the training set is 
representative (in a formal sense) of the task (On- 
cina et al, 1993). Nevertheless, although the 
SSTs learned by OSTIA are usually good trans- 
lation models, they are often poor input language 
models. In practice, they very accurately trans- 
late correct input sentences, but also accept and 
translate incorrect sentences producing meaning- 
less results. This yields undesirable effects in case 
of noisy input, like the one obtained by OCR or 
speech recognition. 
To overcome this problem, the algorithm 
OSTIA-DR (Oncina and Var6, 1996) uses finite 
state domain (input language) and range (out- 
put language) models, which allow to learn SSTs 
that only accept input sentences and only produce 
output sentences compatible with those language 
models. OSTIA-DR can make use of any kind 
of finite state model. In particular, models can 
be n-testable automata, which are equivalent to 
n-grams (Vidal et al, 1995) and can be also au- 
tomatically learned from examples. 
3 Introducing Word Categories in 
the Learning and Translation 
Processes 
An approach for using categories together with 
SSTs was presented in (Vilar et al, 1995), proving 
it to be useful in reducing the number of examples 
required for learning. However, the approach pre- 
sented there was not easily integrable in a speech 
recognition system and did not provide for the 
case in which the categories included units larger 
than a word. 
For the EUTRANS project, the approach was 
changed so that a single USST would comprise 
all the information for the translation, including 
elementary transducers for the categories. These 
steps were followed: 
? CATEGORY IDENTIFICATION. The categories 
used in EUTRANS were seven: masculine 
names, femenine names, surnames, dates, 
hours, room numbers, and general numbers. 
The election of these categories was done 
while keeping with the example based nature 
of the project. In particular, the categories 
chosen do not need very specific rules for 
recognising them, the translation rules they 
follow are quite simple, and the amount of 
special linguistic knowledge introduced was 
very low.

gories were defined, simple scripts ubstituted 
the words in the categories by adequate la- 
bels, so that the pair (ddme la Have de la 
habitaci6n ciento veintitrds - give me the key 
to room one two three) became (dime Is Uave 
de la habitaci6n $ROOM - give me the key 
to room SROOM), where $ROOM is the cat- 
egory label for room numbers. 
? INITIAL MODEL LEARNING. The  categorised 
corpus was used for training a model, the ini- 
tial SST. 
? CATEGORY MODELLING. For each  cate -  
gory ,  a simple SST was built: its category 
SST  (cSST). 
? CATEGORY EXPANSION. The arcs in the ini- 
tial SST corresponding to the different cate- 
gories were expanded using their cSSTs. 
A general view of the process can be seen in Fig- 
ure 1. The left part represents he elements in- 
volved in the learning of the expanded USST, ex- 
emplified with a single training pair. The right 
part of the diagram gives a schematic representa- 
tion of the use of this transducer. 
The category expansion step is a bit more com- 
plex than just substituting each category-labeled 
arc by the corresponding cSST. The main prob- 
lems are: (I) how to insert the output of the 
cSST within the output of the initial transducer; 
(2) how to deal with more than one final state in 
the cSST; (3) how to deal with cycles in the cSST 
involving its initial state. 
The problem with the output had certain sub- 
telities, since the translation of a category label 
46 
can appear before or after the label has been seen 
in the input. For example, consider the transducer 
in Figure2(a) and a Spanish sentence categorised 
as me voy a $HOUR, which corresponds to the 
categorised English one I am leaving at $HOUR. 
Once me roy a is seen, the continuation can only 
be $HOUR, so the initial SST, before seeing this 
category label in the input, has already produced 
the whole output (including $HOUR). Taking this 
into account, we decided to keep the output of the 
initial SST and to include there the information 
necessary for removing the category labels. To do 
this, the label for the category was considered as 
a variable that acts as a placeholder in the output 
sentence and whose contents are also fixed by an 
assignment appearing elsewhere within that sen- 
tence. In our example, the expected output for 
me roy alas tres y media could be I am leaving 
at $HOUR $HOUR = \[half past three\]. This as- 
sumes that each category appears at most once 
within each sentence. 
The expanded model is obtained by an itera- 
tive procedure which starts with the initial SST. 
Each time the procedure finds an arc whose in- 
put symbol is a category label, it expands this arc 
by the adequate cSST producing a new model. 
This expansion can introduce non-determinism, so 
these new models are now USSTs. When every arc 
of this kind has been expanded, we have the ex- 
panded USST. The expansion of each arc follows 
these steps: 
? Eliminate the arc. 
? Create a copy of the cSST corresponding to 
the category label. 
? Add new arcs linking the new cSST with the 
USST. These arcs have to ensure that the 
output produced in the cSST is embraced be- 
tween c=\[ and \], c being the category label. 
? Eliminate useless tates. 
Formally, we have an USST 7" = (X ,Y ,Q ,  
qo, E,a) ,  a cSST r~ = (X ,Y ,  Qc, qoe, E~,ac), 
where we assume that ac(qoc = 0, and an arc 
(p, c, z, q) e ~ E. We will produce a new USST 
r' = (x ,v ,  QuQ~,qo , (E -  (p ,e ,z ,q ) )u  E~,a'). 
The new elements are: 
? The set Q~ is disjoint with Q and there exists 
a bijection ? : Qc ~ Q~. 
? The new set of arcs is: 
E'~ = {(?(r),a,y,?(s))lCr, a ~,s) e Ec)} 
u {(p,a, zc=\[y,?(s)) l (qoc,a,y,s)  E Ee)} 
u {(?(r),a, yac(s)\],q)l(r,a,y,s) ~ Ec) 
Aa?(s) # 0} 
U {(p,a, zc=\[ya~(s)\],q)\[(qo?,a,y,s) E Ec) 
^so(s) ~ o} 
Note that this solves the problems deriving 
from the cSST having multiple final states or 
cycles involving the initial state. The price to 
pay is the introduction of non-determinism in 
the model. 
? The new state emission function is: 
{ a(s) i f sEQ 
Finally, the useless tates that may appear during 
this construction are removed. 
A simple example of the effects of this procedure 
can be seen on Figure 2. The drawing (a) depicts 
the initial SST, (b) is a cSST for the hours between 
one and three (in o'clock and half past forms), and 
the expanded USST is in (c). 
4 Overview of the Speech 
Tr-an.~lation System 
A possible scheme for speech translation consists 
in translating the output of a conventional Contin- 
uous Speech Recognition (CSR) front-end. This 
implies that some restrictions present in the trans- 
lation and the output language, which could en- 
hance the acoustic search, are not taken into ac- 
count. In this sense, it is preferable to integrate 
the translation model within a conventional CSR 
system to carry out a simultaneous search for the 
recognised sentence and its corresponding trans- 
lation. This integration can be done by using a 
SST as language and translation model, since it 
has included in the learning process the restric- 
tions introduced by the translation and the output 
language. Experimental results show that bet- 
ter performance is achieved (Jimdnez et al, 1994; 
Jim/mez et al, 1995). 
Thus, our system can be seen as the result of in- 
tegrating a series of finite state models at different 
levels: 
? ACOUSTIC  LEVEL. Individual phones are rep- 
resented by means of Hidden Markov Models 
(HMMs). 
? LEXICAL LEVEL. Individual words are repre- 
sented by means of finite state automata with 
arcs labeled by phones.

? SYNTACTIC AND TRANSLATION LEVEL. The 
syntactic onstrains and translation rules are 
represented by an USST. 
In our case, the integration means the substitution 
of the arcs of the USST by the automata describ- 
ing the input language words, followed by the sub- 
stitution of the arcs in this expanded automata by 
the corresponding HMMs. In this way, a conven- 
tional Viterbi search (Fomey, 1973) for the most 
likely path in the resulting network, given the in- 
put acoustic observations, can be performed, and 
both the recognised sentence and its translation 
are found by following the optimal path. 
5 Experiments 
5.1 The Traveler Task 
The Traveler Task (Amengual et al, 1996b) was 
defined within the EUTRANS project (Amengual 
et al, 1996a). It is more realistic that the one 
in (Castellanos et al, 1994), but, unlike other cor- 
pora such as the Hansards (Brown et al, 1990), it 
is not unrestricted. 
The general framework established for the Trav- 
eler Task aims at covering usual sentences that can 
be needed in typical scenarios by a traveler visiting 
a foreign country whose language he/she does not 
speak. This framework includes a great variety 
of different ranslation scenarios, and thus results 
appropriate for progressive experimentation with 
increasing level of complexity. In a first phase, 
the scenario has been limited to some human-to- 
human communication situations in the reception 
of a hotel: 
? Asking for rooms, wake-up calls, keys, the 
bill, a taxi and moving the luggage. 
? Asking about rooms (availability, features, 
price). 
? Having a look at rooms, complaining about 
and changing them. 
? Notifying a previous reservation. 
? Signing the registration form. 
? Asking and complaining about the bill. 
? Notifying the departure. 
? Other common expressions. 
The Traveler Task text corpora re sets of pairs, 
each pair consisting in a sentence in the input lan- 
guage and its corresponding translation in the out- 
put language. They were automatically built by 
using a set of Stochastic, Syntax-directed Trans- 
lation Schemata (Gonzalez and Thomason, 1978) 
with the help of a data generation tool, specially 
developed for the EUTRANS project. This soft- 
ware allows the use of several syntactic extensions

to these schema specifications in order to express 
optional rules, permutation of phrases, concor- 
dance (of gender, number and case), etc. The use 
of automatic corpora generation was convenient 
due to time constrains of the first phase of the 
EUTRANS project, and cost-effectiveness. More- 
over, the complexity of the task can be controlled. 
The languages considered were Spanish as input 
and English, German and Italian as output, giving 
a total of three independent corpora of 500,000 
pairs each. Some examples of sentence pairs are 
shown in Table I. Some features of the corpora 
can be seen in Table 2. For each language, the test 
set perplexity has been computed by training a 
trigram model (with simple fiat smoothing) using 
a set of 20,000 random sentences and computing 
the probabilities yielded by this model for a set of 
i0,000 independent random sentences. The lower 
perplexity of the output languages derives from 
a design decision: multiple variants of the input 
sentences were introduced to account for different 
ways of expressing the same idea, but they were 
given the same translation. 
Finally, a multispeaker speech corpus for the 
task was acquired. It consists of 2,000 utterances 
in Spanish. Details can be found in (Amengual et 
al., 1997a). 
5.2 Text Input Experiments 
Our approach was tested with the three text cor- 
pora. Each one was divided in training and test 
sets, with 490,000 and 10,000 pairs, respectively. 
A sequence of models was trained with increasing 
subsets of the training set. Each model was tested 
using only those sentences in the test set that were 
not seen in training. This has been done because 
a model trained with OST IA -DR is guaranteed 
to reproduce exactly those sentences it has seen 
during learning. The performance was evaluated 
in terms of Word Error Rate (WER), which is 
the percentage of output words that has to be in- 
serted, deleted and substituted for they to exactly 
match the corresponding expected translations. 
The results for the three corpora can be seen 
on Table 3. The columns labeled as "Different" 
and "Categ.", refer to the number of different sen- 
tences in the training set and the number of differ- 
ent sentences after categorization. Graphical rep- 
resentations of the same results are on Figures 3, 
4 and 5. As expected, the use of lexical categories 
had a major impact on the learning algorithm. 
The differences in WER attributable to the use of 
lexical categories can be as high as about a 40% 
in the early stages of the learning process and de- 
crease when the number of examples grows. The 
large increase in performance is a natural conse- 
quence of the fact that the categories help in re- 
ducing the total variability that can be found in 
the corpora (although sentences do exhibit a great 
deal of variability, the underlying syntactic struc- 
ture is actually much less diverse). They also have 
the advantage of allowing an easier extension in 
the vocabulary of the task without having a neg- 
ative effect on the performance of the models so 
obtained (Vilar et al, 1995). 
5.3 Speech Input Experiments 
A set of Spanish to English speaker independent 
translation experiments were performed integrat- 
ing in our speech input system (as described in

section 4) the following models: 
? ACOUSTIC LEVEL. The phones were rep- 
resented by context-independent continuous- 
density HMMs. Each HMM consisted of six 
states following a left-to-right topology with 
loops and skips. The emission distribution of 
each state was modeled by a mixture of Gaus- 
sians. Actually, there were only three emi~. 
sion distributions per HMM since the states 
were tied in pairs (the first with the second, 
the third with the fourth, and the fifth with 
the sixth). Details about the corpus used in 
training these models and its parametrization 
can be found in (Amengnal et al, 1997a). 
? LEXICAL LEVEL Spanish Phonetics allows 
the representation f each word as a sequence 
of phones that can be derived from standard 
rules. This sequence can be represented by a 
simple chain. There were a total of 31 phones, 
including stressed and unstressed vowels plus 
two types of silence. 
SYNTACTIC AND TRANLATION LEVEL. We 
used the best of the transducers obtained in 
the Spanish to English text experiments. It 
was enriched with probabilities estimated by 
parsing the same training data with the final 
model and using relative frequencies of use as 
probability estimates. 
The Viterbi search for the most likely path was 
speeded up by using beam search at two levels: 
independent beam widths were used in the states 
of the SST (empirically fixed to 300) and in the 
states of the HMMs. Other details of the experi- 
ments can be found in (Amengnal et al, 1997a). 
Table 4 shows that good translation results (a 
WER of 6.4%) can be achieved with a Real Time 
Factor (RTF) of just 2.2. It is worth noting that 
these results were obtained in a HP-9735 worksta- 
tion without resorting to any type of specialised 
hardware or signal processing device. When trans- 
lation accuracy is the main concern, a more de- 
tailed acoustic model and a wider beam in the 
search can be used to achieve a WER of 1.9%, 
but with a RTF  of 11.3.

automatically earned from corpora of examples. 
This learning process can be improved by means 
of categories using the approach detailed in this 
paper. 
Experimental results show that this approach 
reduces the number of examples required for 
achieving ood models, with good translation re- 
sults in acceptable times without using speciaiised 
hardware. 
Our current work concentrates in further reduc- 
ing the number of examples necessary for training 
the translation models in order to cope with spon- 
taneous instead of synthetic sentences. For this, 
new approaches are being explored, like reordering 
the words in the translations, the use of new in- 
ference algorithms, and automatic ategorization. 
Results obtained with a different enhancement 
of our text input system, the inclusion of error 
correcting techniques, can be found in (Amengual 
et al, 1997b).
