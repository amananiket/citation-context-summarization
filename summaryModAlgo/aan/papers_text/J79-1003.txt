ABSTRACT 
This papar d i s c u ~ s e e  human semantic knowledge and proceesing 
i n  terms of the SCHOLAR system. In one major sect ion  we di scuss  
the imprecision, the incompleteness, the open-endedness, and the 
uncertainty of psopl,eqs knowledge. In the other major sect ion  we 
diecuss strategies people use to make di f ferent  types of deductive, 
negative,  and functional inferences,  and the way uncertaint ies  
combine in  these in ferences .  
Irapreeision can occur either i n  memory or i n  camunicat ion.  
SCHOLAR can have precf ae values or fuzzy values stored, and its 
procedures can, to eome extent, deal with fuzzy questions when 
precise valtues are stored, and w i t h  precise queltions, when fuzzy 
values are stored. Embedding allows i n f o  t i o n  to be specified 
i n  the data base to any level of d e t a i l  or preci sfon. But SCHOLAR 
only camunicatea the nwst important i n f o  t i o n  on any topic (as 
rneasured by importmce tags) ,  unless more i n f o  t i o n  i s  requested. 
1.t should a l s o  be possible by using importance tags to adjust  what 
+jon SCHOLAR communicates, i n  accord with the sophistication 
and, i n t e r e s t s  of the l i s t e n e r .  
Inference atrategiee tha t  are appropriate when the complete 
set of object attributes, or values, is  known (i .em, in a closed 
world) do not apply when knowledge is incomplete e ,  i n an 
open wrld)  . There are a variety of u n c e r t ~ i n  i n f  ercnces  that  
people use to circumvent the hales i n  their knowledge, which are 
being progr ed i n  SCHOLAR. 
There is a set o f  transitive relations -- superordinate, 
superpart, s lar i ty ,  pra imi ty  , subordinate, and subpart relations 
-- that people frequently use to make deductive inferences, 
Currently SCHO on ly  handles superordinate i n f e r e n c e s  (em g . , 
the Llanos has a rainy season because it is a savanna) and super- 
part inferences (e .g, , the language in Rio is Portuguese because 
R i o  is part of Brazil). ~ e d u c t i v e  inferences can be more or l e a s  
c e r t a i n  (similarity inferences are l i k e  s u p t o r d i n a t e  inferences. 
but l e a s  certain) and can have restrictions on their use (only 
certain attributes transfer an superpart). 
~ b n  k owledge is incomplete, it is not safe t o  assume that 
something is n o t  true just because it  i s  not s t o r e d .  Thus an in- 
ference is necessary to decide when to say ' N o w  and when to say 
'I donBt know,@ There is a eamp1Pcated s e t  sf strategies in 
SCHOLAR to find vatious kinds of contradictions that people case 
to say *NO, " If a contradict ion cannot be found, another nega8ive 
inference, cal led  the Wlack-aF-knawledgea inference, f s tried* 
When enough is known a b u t  an abjech it is possible to conclude 
that someaing is not true ut mat object ow the  ground8 that 
if it were true, it m u l d  be stared, 
another class of wcer ta in  inferences depends an i l l - d e f  ined 
knovledge of functional datenainants , e .g. , that climate depends 
OR l a t i tude  and a l t i t u d e .  D % f  ferent ways tha t  p o p l e  use fmctional 
knowledge irnm1ve fmct ianal  ealeulatisms (a.g,,  if a place has a 
part icular  latitude, it probably has a particular elihate), func- 
tional analogies ( e , g , ,  if a place is like another place in latitude 
and altitude, it probably has the sme ch imte )  , and ts answer Why 
questions (egg,, a place h g  a particular elfmte because of its 
latitude and altitude), 
Different  inf erenees can esIwBine in d i f f e r e n t  ways, Somtims 
one strategy may call another strategy to hind an anewer, men 
different inferences independently reach the s m e  or differmt con-- 
elusions, a e y  coItnbiwe to increase or d s r e a s s  certainty, T h e  pm- 
ing sf uncertain Bnfermces is wecessqw to make cawutars as

In t h i s  paper we will discuss how to eepresent and process 
infomatioil  in a computer in ways tha t  are natural to people .  
This does not  mean doing away completely w i t h  representations and 
procedures which computers have traditionally used, but adding 
new representations and procedures which they have not used. 
People often store and communicate imprecise, incomplete, 
and unquantified info t i o n ;  they a f t e n  assert truth or falsity 
in relative terms; and they seldom seem to use r igorous logic in 
t he i r  i n f e r e n t i a l  processes. Because of these c o n d i t i o n s ,  people 
s , eem to have an almost i n f i n i t e  i n f o  tion processing capaci ty,  
w i t h  i n f e r e n c e  making and problem solving abilities more r e f i n e d  
and far more f l e x i b l e  than any ex i s t ing  computer program. 
Now man we study a e s e  hman eapabiLities in order to make 
our machines show similar perfbnnance? A combination of 
approaches is perhaps best. Observat ion of people ' s behavior, 
introspection, some experimentation, protocol analysf s, and 
synthesis of computer programs can a l l  be vhluable t echn i l~ues .  A 
6 recent paper (CalZins, mrnock and Passafime ) discusses  a tech- 
nique for combining protocol analysis with program synthesis as 
applied to tutorial  dialogues. The synthesis directs what to 
analyze, and the strategies observed in the analysis are evaluated 
by synthesis, in a kind of feedback Poop We have been u s i n g  
the SCHOLAR system in this way as a vehicle f o r  experimentation 
w i t h  natural semnties. 
Before we d i s c u s s  some of t h e  major problems in natural 
semantics, we w i l l  b r i e f l y  describe the SCHOLAR system, since it 
i e  t he  enviroment  f o r  our  research. A word of caution though: 
we are only  t r y i n g  to develop some i n s i g h t s ,  without  attempting 
to be exhaustive. More questions w i l . 1  be raised than qnewers 
provided. There are many observable things  people do that  we do 
n o t  h o w  how to simulate,

SCHOLAR s knowledge about any subject matter is in the form of a 
s t a t i c  semantic network of facts,  concepts, and procedures. This  
12 i a  a modified and extended nemork a la Q u i l l i n  and has a r i c h  
i n t e r n a l  s t r u c t u r e  w i t h  a well-deQEined syntax.  
~ ia logue  w i t h  SCHOLAR take8 place $XI a aeubaet of ~nglish t h a t  
is limited mainly by SCHOLAR% currently primitive syntactic 
capabi l i t i e s .  In tutorial fashion, t he  system uses its semantic 
network to generate t he  material it presents, t h e  questions it 
asks, and the corrections it makes. At any time SCHOLAR accepts 
questions and r ests f r o m  the s t u d e n t ,  and generates responses 
based on its semantic network, making calculat ions and f nferences 
of different types t h a t  i t  has  been progaamed to handle. The 
dialogue is unanticipated, and i s  dependent on t h e  student's 
rsspanses, questions, and requests. Figure 1 presents a sample 
protocol of an in te rac t ion  w i t h  SCHOLAR: the person types a f t e r  
t he  as ter isk  and returns control  to the system w i t h  a second 
as ter isk ,  
Figure 2 shows some excerpts of SCHOLAR'S semantic network. 
Properties, none of which are obligatory, can have as values 
( s ingle  words usual ly  English words def ined  elsewhere in the 
ne twork ) ,  n ers, different types of l i r t s ,  and other  proper t ies .  
Attributes are usually English words, but there is a s e t  of 
special attributes for  i r t a n t  r e la t ions ,  like SUPERC ( for  
superconcept or superardinate, e.g. , Lima is a city and a capf t a l )  , 
SUPERP (for superpart, e.g., Lima i a  a par t  of Peru  and South 
~merica) ,  SUPERA ( for  superattribute, e , g , ,  f e r t i l e  refers to s o i l

In this section we discuss some aspects of natural semantic 
i n foma t ion  and its relation to artf Ficial intelligence. 
3 , f  
Imprecise language is an essential characteristic of human 
PO 
comnrun&cation. As Lyons says, *Far from being a defect a s  
some philosophers have suggested, referential 'impreciseness' ... 
makes language a more efficient means of communication. " Talking 
ut a tall person or a blue-green object does not require 
precise specif icat ion of he igh t  or spectral characteristics. The 
imprecision may occur either in communication or storage. If we 
say that a colleague receives a large salary, we may or may n o t  
h o w  the f igu re .  
SCHOLAR c u r r e n t l y  stores areas and populations in n 
form, but it can respond to the fuzzy question "Is Montevideo 
large?" with a p e r t i n e n t  answer l i k e :  'It is n o t  one of the 
largest cities in South America, but it is the largest c i t y  in 
Uruguay, " Here SCWOLaR has found tm supeqarts ,  South meriea 
and Uruguay* and then campred M n t e v i d w  to other cities in each 
w i t h  qespect to population. 
However, it is mrce co n fo r  people to @tore values 
that are irarprecise or f l fuzzy' ,  what 2adeb19 calls 'linguistic' 
variables. This is the case w i t h  values like large' ,  'red', 'ho-t' , 
' r i c h g ,  etc. It seems to us that one must be able  to store 
e i ther  precise values or fuzzy values interchangeably. (In f a c t ,  
SCHO has fuzzy values as well as preoiae values atoted, e.g. ,  
t h a t  the Brazilian Highlands has a large population.) Further-  
more, the procedures t h a t  a c t  upon therre values must be f lexible 
enough to deal  with either. 
3 2  
Imprecise statements $re of t e n  motivated by incomplete 
specification. S ince  a l l  specifications can be refined, they 
are essentially incomplete. We store what is necessary, and if 
we store more, we o n l y  comunieate what is pertinent. SCHOLAR 
does this through its I-tags.  If it is asked ' T e l l  me about 
Perm," it only gims a f e w  s a l i e n t  facts. 
F u r t h e r  spec i f ica t ion  can be added by r e f i n i n g  e x i s t i n g  
values. l o r  axmple, i n s t ead  of 'blue we can have 'Navy bluev, 
OB. 'quite dark MaPry blue" ,tee. Furbher specification can also 
be added by giving plow properties w i t h  a t t r ibu tes  somenhat 
ortkogonal to previous ones. An example of this is 'tall man' 
veraua 'tall, h e a v  m n  wearing glasses0. Propert ies  can be 
specified to any level of detail by embedding, an  i n h e r e n t  qual i ty  
of SCHO -type semantic networks.  
Somawhat related to incompleteness and relevancy is the 
eference problem (see Olsonl') Referring to a colleague, we 
nay 'define8 him as the father of Jack and Jill, or the author of 
that  paper on self-referential otatments ,  or tihe t a l l  t h i n  fell- 
ufth glasses. We decide on some specification de.pending on the 
:ontext, including our assumptions about the person we are talking 
to. People usually specify o n l y  to the degree that is needed. 
In this sense, every partial specification is a ' d e f i n i t i o n ' .  
The problem of context pemades matualb senam8;%es. 
Def in i t ions  and specifications,  anaphoric references, what and 
h o w  to answer, a l l  depend on context. Furthe re, there usually 
eo-exist a range of contexts from overall con tex t  to short- tern 
running contexts.  For example. at a given time, SCHOLAR may 
have the contexts South America, Argentina and Buenos A i r e s r  each 
w i t h  some dwamically adjustable If fe. What is releva*. at any 
given t h e  depends on this contextual hierarchy. 
A s tart  toward making references specific to the listener 
is possible in a SCHOLAR-type system by using I-tags (see Collins, 
Warnock, and ~ a s s a f  iumeb) . The likelihood t h a t  another pereon 
will know about any concept ie raugkily pmwrtional to the 
importance of the concept,  as measured by the 1-tags,  with 
respect to the overall  context. Therefore, it is possible to 
sstfmate .the sophist icat ion of a permn based on the level of tags 
of the concepts he ment ions  in h i s  conversation. This estimate 
then can influence the descript ion one uses in referring to Some 
concept. For example, to an unsophisticated listener one might 
refer to the "capital of Argentina" rather t h a n  'Buenos Aires, a 
because the I-tags fo r  the concepts *capitalw and "Argentinaw are 
lamr than *ose for  'Buenos AiresFw as  masured from a context  
such a8 geographyc 
In t he  fugure  we want to have adjustable con t ex t s  in SCROLM, 
eo mat it can  t a l k  about ~e ARPA ne twork ,  say, "from a communi- 
cations p o i n t  of viewm to one person and *from a progr fng p o i n t  
a% viewm to another person. What this e n t a i l s  is a temporary 
a l t e r a t ion  of t he  relat ive values of I-tags th roughout  t h e  
s a a n t i c  n e b o r k ,  Thwe concepts t h a t  are referred to under  $Pae

d a b  base, fo r  the person interested in communication. A 
corresponding chmge must be made for  the person i n t e r e s t e d  in 
ing OP any a a e r  concept or s e t  of concepts. This kind 
of sensitivity to tihe interests and background of the person, and 
the kind of s e n s i t i v i t y  (described above) to the saph i s t i ca t ion  
sf Ule person may be the two major alments  i n  the way people 
adapt what they say to t h e  listener,

.ystam (Hoods ) , a blocks world (Winograd F, or a lunar rocks 
catalogue (Woods, Kaplan, and ~ a s h - ~ e ~ e r l ~ )  , there is a closed 
aet  of objects, attr ibutes ,  and rmluel~ to deal w i t h .  However, 
.ip most real world domains such as those faced by SIR ( ~ a ~ h a e l " ) ,  
2 
TLC (quillian'2) at SCHOLAR (Carbonell ) , there are open set8 of 
objects, attributes, and values. It turns out tha t  the procedures 
and even the rulae of inferdnce that can be applied are different 
i n  closed and open worlds, 
The di s t inc t ion  between closed and open assts is one of 
exhaustiveness and not one of s i z e ,  For ex le,, the set of 
states (e.g., Iowa) . which is a cYbeed s e t  for most people, is 
probably larger than the set of cattle breeds ( e a g e r  Aolatein), 
nfrich is an o set.  However, & p a  sets  t m d  to be lkrger  i n %  
general than closed sets. 
The di s t inc t ion  is important in a variety of ways. For 
example, if there are no basaleic rocks  stored 191 a ehasad a t a  
base, then it makes sense to aay *Nom to the quelrtian %ere any 
basaltic rocks brought back?* Bag if no oolcanoea are stared 
for the U. S,, it does not f o l l m  that the aur 
to the question "Are there any mlcandee in the U. S . 7 .  A more 
appropriate answer i s  *I dont.t know.' P u t t h e  re, it makes 
8en.e to ask *at the smallest b lock  in a scene is or the r o c k  
w i a  l eas t  a l m i n m  c~ncmtRat f sn ,  But it makes no sense to ask 
what is t he  malleat  c i t y  in Braz i l  or the leaat  f 
in the  U. S, It uould be an appmpriate strategy for deciding 
how many flights f r o m  Boston to Chitago are nonstop, to consider 
each flight and count how mny make O stops. But it would not 
be an appropriate strategy to consider each person smred in a 
1hPted h t a  base (such as h s b v e ) ,  in orden to answer the 
question *How many people in the U. S. are over 30 years old?" 
Within open worlds there are cbsed sets,  so tha t  a question l i k e  
'How many states are on the Pacific?' makes sense whereae 'How 
many cities are on the Pacific?" does not. SCAOLAR dais w i t h  
thie by distinguishing exhaustive sets  from n~n-exhaustive sets. 
We w i l l  d iscuss  in Sect ion  4 how SdlHOmR Begins to deal with 
open mrld semantics. We essmtial point  here is that the well- 
defined pmcadums t h a t  are appropriate for a closed world s h p l y  
do n o t  carry over to an open world. Unfortunately,  m a t  of h 
knowledge is open-ended, and w people have complex strategies for 
deal ing with uncertainty and facing problears such as how to apply

me two-valued logic that undatliee the propasitional 
calculus and related approachee to inference c a ~ o t  encompass 
natural ssltwa cs. The tfouble arises because truth varies in 
degree, in t h e ,  in range, in c e r t a i n t y ,  and in p o i n t  o f  view of 
the observer, when it is applied to real-world objects. We will 
briefly examine some of the implications of the multivalued na tu re  
or t g u % P a  fo r  n a t u r a l  smaatica, 
olVc logic uses quantif i ce t ion  to d i s t i n g u i s h  between 
the universal and the particular, e.g., between "All men are 
m r t d W  and amme men b v e  mrts, "" But *ere is no allowance 
mde for the degrees of t r u t h  as between say "Some nren have wartsR 
and .Some men have ears,* even though on ly  a fract ion have warts 
and a &t a l l  haw ears, Pwple  w i l l  i n f e r  t h a t  Mewbn had ears

not in f er  *at Nets&an had warts, The inference in *e fomer 
case t reats  the particular l i k e  the universal, because almost 
all men have ears. The more  generally trw a statement is, the 
more certainty people assign to such an inference. There j u s t  are 
not  many universal truths to be found o u t  i n  the cold, c r u e l  world,

4.1 Deductive Inferences 
There are several transitive relations that people use 
frequently to i n f e r  that a property of one thing may be a property 
of the other. These include superordinate, superpart, similari ty,  
proximity, s rdinate, and eubpart relat ions.  
O f  the above types SCHO now h a n a e s  o n l y  s u p r a r d i n a t e  
and superpart infersnces, mich are the mast co n. For example, 
if asked *Does the Llanos have a r a iny  seas~n?~, SCHOLAR will 
There is some j ung le  in here (points  to Venezuela) but 
this breaks i n t o  a savanna around the Orinoco ,  
Oh r ight ,  that is where they grow the coffee up there? 
I don't think that  the savanna is used for  growing 
coffee. The trouble is the savanna has  a rainy season 
and *u can't count on rain in general. But I don't 
know. T h i s  area around Sao Paula is caf fee regionr and 
it is sort of g e t t i n g  i n t o  the savanna region there. 
A r e  there any other areas where o i l  is found other than 
Venezuela? 
N o t  particularly.  There is same a i l  offshore there b u t  
in general o i l  comes from Venezuela. Venezuela ie the 
only  one t h a t  b making any money in oil.  
Is the C h a c ~  the cattle c a u n t q ?  I know the ca t t l e  
count ry  is down there, 
I th ink it's mre sheep country.  I t @ , e  l i k e  wes te rn  Texas

&nd t he  n o ~ t h e r n  p a r t  oT Argentina has a large sort of 
semi-arid p l a i n  that  extends  into Paraguay. And that's 
a p la in s  area h a t  is relatively unpopulated. 
Because it" p r e t t y  drya 
Figure 3. Tutor-Student  Dialogue Excerpts 
f irs t  l o o k  under Llanos and failing to find the info 
there, will look under Llanosv S U P E X  (for superordinate), which 
is savanna, and its SUPEW (far superpart), which is Venezuela 
and Colombia. A rainy season i s  a property of savannas and so 
the superordinate in ference  p r o v i e s  the answer. The superpart 
inference is less general because it i s  restricted to certain 
attltlbutes such as climate, language, and topography. One would 
not want to conclude that the capital of Massachusetts is 
Washington, D. C., j u s t  because Massachusetts is part of the 
United Shates, Because moat properties of a sdperordinate or 
superpart are only generally true, and hot universally true, 
exceptions must be stored to preclude an incorrect inference 
(~a~heel'~). 
similarity and proximity inferences parallel the eupemrdihate 
and superpart inferences, but they carry less cer ta inty .  An ex- 
ample of a person using a pmximity inference  i s  sham in the 
latter part of the tutor's response in E 
The tutor f irst  said tha t  a savanna could no t  be used fo r  growing 
caf f ee ,  but  then he backed off  this conelusion because of the 
proximity of the large Brazilian savanna to the coffee-growing 
region there. To illustrate a similarity inference: if one 
knows a wallaby is like a kangaroo, Only amaller ,  then one will 
infer that a wallaby probably has a pouch. W e  plan to add 
similarity information to SCHOLAR in the near future,  because it 
will also  be useful in making functioaal analogies which are 
discussed below. The tecently added map f a c i l i t y  (Harnock and 
~ollins'') which ties together visual and semantic representations, 
makes proximity inferences possible, but they are still a way off. 
Subordinate and subpart i n f  erencee follow a somewhat d i f f e r e n t  
pattern f r o m  the athers discussed. If asked whether South rfca 
produces any o i l ,  a person will answer "YesM because Venezuela, 
which is part of South America, produces oil. But one does no t  
want to conclude that South merica is ho t  because the mazon 
jungle is. We haven't warked out the deta i ls  of the r e s t r i c t i o n s  
on these inferences  as ye t .  
There are other  transi t ive  re la t ions  that are used to mke 
deductive inferences  but they are not as prevalent  as the ones 
o u t l i n e d  here, 
Negative information, such as t h e  fact that men do not have 
wheels, is no t  usually stared but rather in fe r red .  In a closed 
world t h i a  presents  no prablemt it is reaeondle  to assume that 
if something it? n o t  stored, then it is not  true. In f a c t r  ear ly  
versions of SCHOLAR say * N o w  if asked "fs o i l  a product of Brazi l?" 
just because oil isn't storad for Brazil. But in the real  warld, 
t he  f a c t  Ulat somthing is not stored does n o t  necessarily mean 
t it is not  true. People seem to have complex strategies for  
deciding when to say @ N o w  and when to say @I don't know. ~4 We 
have recently been implementing these  in SCHOLAR. 
One kind of negative inference now in SCHOLAR is a simple 
contradiction procedure. It relies on contradictory values 
stored wi th  various concepts: for example, barren contradicts 
fertile, and democracy contradicts dictatorship. Suppose 
SCHOLAR i a  asked 1 s  the Pampas barren?* It would f i n d  the soi l  
of the Pampas 1s ferti le,  anti since fe r t i l e  contradicts barren, 
it w u l d  say *No. The s o i l  of t h e  Pampas is fe r t i l e . "  
There is an h p o N a n t  class of contradictions that  are n o t  
subsumed under t h e  procedure ve. For example, conrtider the 
questio~ *Is Buenos A i r e s  a c i t y  in Brazil?. The fact t h a t  
Buenos Aires is n o t  among t h e  c i t i e s  of B r a z i l  is no reason to 
say "Norw because there are eitiea in Braz i l ,  such as Cor 
which are not stored. But there are three facts that ether 
make a contradiction possible$ (1) Buenos A i r e s  is located in 
Argentina, (2) cit ies  only have one location, and 3 )  Argentina 
and Brazil are mutually exclusive. We can i l lustrate  tne 
necessity for conditions ( 2 )  and ( 3 )  : (2) even though Portuguese 
is the language of Portugal, it is alsd the language of Brazi l  
e ,  language can have mbre than one location]; ( 3 )  even though 
Sao Paulo is in South America, it is also i n  Brazil . South 
America and Brazil are not mutually exclusive). Making an 
incorrect negative inference about cities w i t h  more than one 
location (e.g. Kansas City)  or different c i t ies  w i t h  the same 
name (Rome, New York, and Rome, Italy) is precluded by storing 
bath locations specifically, just as with deductive inferences . 
The strategy we have worked o u t  and implemented to find different 
contradictions of t h i s  kind is f a i r l y  complex. 
Failure to find a contradic t ion leads to anather kind of 
negative inference people - use which we c a l l  the lack-of -knowledge 
5 inference ( C o l l i n s ,  Carbonell and Warnock . Ex le 2 of 
Figure  3 shows the tutor using this strategy. The baeiB of the 
t u b r w s  i n f e r ence  is this: since he knows as muck a b u t  other  
Sou* merican countries as he knows about Venezuela, it is a 
p l a u s i b l e  but uncer ta in  i n f e r ence  that. if other countries produced 
a i l ,  he would h o w  about L t .  ( h i s  conclusion was at leas t  
somavhat wrong, because there are in fact several other aountries 
in South Ame~ica that produce o i l .  though far those countries oil 
is not nearly so important a% it is for  Venezuela.) 
Sach a s t ra tegy  is c u r r e n t l y  being implemented in SCHO in 
the following way: If asked a ques t ion  l i k e  *Is o i l  a product of 
Uruguay?" where no a i l  is stored, SCHOLAR can look f o r  oil under 
a i d l a r  object8 k e g . ,  Venezuela or B r a z i l )  or objects w i t h  the 
s m e  SUPEX and SWEW, ff SCHOWR finds sik stored w i a  
Venezuela (say wi th  an 1 -tag of 3)  and if it has enough 
t i o n  stored a b u t  Uruguay (up to an I-mg of 8, s a y )  
to know about oil if it were a t  a l l  important, then it can i n f e r  
that  Uruguay probably has no I .  The degree of c e r t a i n t y  
expressed in the answer ~hould depend on the difference in I-tags 
en the depth of what it knms ut Uruguay and the level at 
which o i l  is stored w i t h  s M l a r  ob jecta. If SCHOLAR can f i n d  no 
similar objects t h a t  have property in question, as with "Is 
sand a product of Uruguay?" the appropriate answer is something 
like *I donot know whether sand is a product of any country in 
South America." The 'heaakk-of-knowledge inference is based on the 
assumption that  one's knowledge is fairly coneistent for similar 
objects.  
4 . 3  Functional Inferences 
F m c  tional inferences are ca n in the dialogues we collected 
6 (Ccllins, Wainock, and Passafiume ) .  Examples 1, 3, and 4 in 
Figure 3 i l lus tra te  the three different ways m have seen people 
use functional knowledge: in quasi calculations, in analogies, 
and in anmer to 'whyw quest ions .  
Functional knowledge, which includes knowledge about func- 
t ional  determinants and their intgractions,  ie learned, j u s t  as 
is factual knowledge, and therefore is stored in SCHOLAR'S data 
base under concept8 such as climate or agricultural products. We 
wuPd argue t the representation of funct ional  knowledge 
should be in a f o m  that different procedures can use. One 
problem is to find a why to represent such knowledge in SCHOLAR 
so tha t  it can be more or less precise, and st i l l  be accessible 
to di f f eren t  s a r s m ~ n e s  that. infer anmers to quest ions  or t h a t  
describe the functional relation to students. 
FmctPanaB calculations can be used Pa both. a positive and 
negative my. One simple positive func t ion  now in SCHOLAR 
calculates the climate of a place if the information is not 
stwed,  Based ow the major functional dete nawts of climate, 
which are l a t i t ude  m d  a l t i t u d e ,  SCMOUR will i n f e r  *ether t h e  
climate is tropical,  sub-*apical, temperate, or cold/palar. A 
negative use 0% ca lcu la t ion  based on t h e  a g r i c u l t u r a l  products 
e m ~ t i ~ n  is show in me first pa9$ of the  tutoro s aaamr in 
Example 1. The f u n c t i o n a l  determinants of agricultural products 
Pwelude the c l $ m a & e ,  s o i l ,  and r a i n f a l l ,  The t u t o r  pieked the 
lack of r a i n  as a basis for  a t en ta t ive  wNo.w N q a t i v e  cabcula- 
t i a n s  do n o t  require as precise knawledge as positive calculations. 
They often only require t h a t  one or two of the f u n c t i o n a l  
d e t e m i n a n t s  have an inappropriate value. 
Like funcf ional  calculatione,  functional analogies can be 
meitive or negative. Example 3 shows the tutor making a positive 
functional analogy, again with the agricultural products function. 
Phere he thought of a region, western Texas, tha t  matched the 
2haeo En terns of climate a d  ra infa l l ,  the functiokaf B e t e m i n -  
snts  of cattle raising, Since he knew that western Wxas was 
c a t t l e  country he inferred that  the  Chaco might be as well. A 
negative f nnc t ional  analogy might have occurred if the student 
had asked whether the Chiieo produced rubber. S ince  the zon 
jungle and Xndonesfa produce rubber, the tutor could have said 
W N ~ W  on the  basis of the mismtch between the Chaea and those 
regions,  w i t h  respect to climate and r a i d f a l l .  
A positive and negative analogy subroutine has been 
implemented in SCHOLAR. It is a fa l lback strategy to be used 
icf them is not enough i n f o  t f s n  stared calculate a e  
functional relationship. For a functional analogy it is only 
necessary to know the functionally relevant a l t r f iu te s  and Uaeir 
relative importance. Then SCHOLAR looks to see if it knows any 
similar objects where the property in question is in fact stored. 
I t  tries to find a match or a mismatch by comparing t h e  gioen 
object and the similar object w i t h  respect to their values on 
the  Eunctiollally relevant attributes.  People frequently uae 
such analogical reasoning, probably because of the  ill-defined 
nature of their knawledge about funct ional  relations.  
The laet example in Figure 3 sh&s the use of a functional 
relation to anewer a @Whyw question. The population density of 
a place depends on an indefinite set o f  functional determinants: 
climate, soil, and rainfall are major ones but distance from the 
sea, the par'icular c o n t i n e n t ,  presence o f  valuable minerals, all 
contribute in different ways. The tutor picked one determinant 
t had a value inapprgpriate for  a large population density 
and gave that  as a reason. By contrast a geographer could  
probably mite a mole treatise on why the Chaco has a l o w  
pspulation d m s i t y ,  W h a t  we aspire POP SCHOLAR to do 1s w h t  the 
tumr didp that is, to pick one or t w o  of the rnarmr d e t e m i n a n t a  
wi t21  appropriate values and give those as a reason. 
Q,4 Xndubtive Inferences 
We menuon induc t ive  i n f e r e n c e s  here only because they are 
a major class  of human inference .  We have n o t  ye t  t r i e d  to 
progrm *em in I A R  since they occur m s t l y  i n  staring 
rather than retrieving i n foma t ion ,  The generalization and d f s -  
c r i d n a t i o n  processes underlyfwg i n d u e t i  on have been dasenssed 
7' in detai l  elsewhere (~eeker'; W I R S ~ O P ~ ~ ~ ;  C o l l i n s  and Quillian ) a 
4.5 
The inferential procdaserr described can combine in a ~ r i e t y  
of ways. For inehance, contradictions can combine w i t h  deductive 
inferences. SCBOWLR will anmer a question like "Is the A t l a n t i c  
orange?" w i t h  wNo, it is blue, because it finds blue fe atorad 
with the SUPER. ,  ocean. Also one fanctfanal inference may c a l l  
another. If the agricultural products function needs a value for 
bhe climate of some region, it could call the climate function to 
compute it. 
A more important way that inferences combine s h o w s  up when 
dif ferent  strategies reach independent canclusiona about the same 
question. A good example is Example I. in Figure 3 .  Them a 
negative functional inference,  w k t h  an implicit lack-of-knowledge 
ihferance, f i es t  led to a tentative * N o u  mawer,  but *en a 
proximity inference produced a possible 'Yeem a n s w e r ,  and so the 
tutor backed off his earlier ""No." men several inferences co-ine 
to yield the s m e  conclusion, a e y  increase the certainty of 
answer, and when they produce oppasite eoneluslons, a e y  deresse 
the certainty, 
There are a n er of sources of mcerainty in in f eren t ia l  
procedures. Uncertainty can derive from the s i z e  sf Ule diffemrence 
between I-tags &n Ule lack-of-knowledge inference, it can derive 
from the degree of match or mismatch in a functional analogy. it 
can derive from the degree of predictivcanees of the func t iona l  
dateminants, andl as m discussed earlier, it can derive f m m  Uae 
degree of certainty about the info t f o n  storad. Theae s o u c e s  
of uncertainty may be c ined ta produce an overdl  uncertainty 
9 (see for example tling This overall uncertainty ia important 
so that long, tenuous chains of reasoning are not pursued to their 
pointless end, and so that  the degree o f  uncer ta in ty  in the a n s w e r  
can be Sadicated to the student,
