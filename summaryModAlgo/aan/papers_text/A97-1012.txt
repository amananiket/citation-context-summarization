This paper describes a new finite-state 
shallow parser. It merges constructive and 
reductionist approaches within a highly 
modular architecture. Syntactic informa- 
tion is added at the sentence level in an 
incremental way, depending on the contex- 
tual information available at a given stage. 
This approach overcomes the inefficiency 
of previous fully reductionist constraint- 
based systems, while maintaining broad 
coverage and linguistic granularity. The 
implementation relies on a sequence of 
networks built with the replace operator. 
Given the high level of modularity, the core 
grammar is easily augmented with corpus- 
specific sub-grammars. The current system 
is implemented for French and is being ex- 
panded to new languages. 
1 Background 
Previous work in finite-state parsing at sentence 
level falls into two categories: the constructive ap- 
proach or the reductionist approach. 
The origins of the constructive approach go back 
to the parser developed by Joshi (Joshi, 1996). It is 
based on a lexical description of large collections of 
syntactic patterns (up to several hundred thousand 
rules) using subcategorisation frames (verbs + essen- 
tial arguments) and local grammars (Roche, 1993). 
It is, however, still unclear whether this heavily lex- 
icalized method can account for all sentence struc- 
tures actually found in corpora, especially due to 
the proliferation of non-argumental complements in 
corpus analysis. 
Another constructive line of research concentrates 
on identifying basic phrases uch as in the FASTUS 
information extraction system (Appelt et al, 1993) 
or in the chunking approach proposed in (Abney, 
72 
1991; Federici et al, 1996). Attempts were made to 
mark the segments with additional syntactic infor- 
mation (e.g. subject or object) (Grefenstette, 1996) 
using simple heuristics, for the purpose of informa- 
tion retrieval, but not for robust parsing. 
The reductionist approach starts from a large 
number of alternative analyses that get reduced 
through the application of constraints. The con- 
straints may be expressed by a set of elimi- 
nation rules applied in a sequence (Voutilainen, 
Tapanainen, 1993) or by a set of restrictions applied 
in parallel (Koskenniemi et al, 1992). In a finite- 
state constraint grammar (Chanod, Tapanainen, 
1996), the initial sentence network represents all 
the combinations of the lexical readings associated 
with each token. The acceptable readings result 
from the intersection of the initial sentence network 
with the constraint networks. This approach led to 
very broad coverage analyzers, with good linguistic 
granularity (the information is richer than in typical 
chunking systems). However, the size of the interme- 
diate networks resulting from the intersection of the 
initial sentence network with the sets of constraints 
raises serious efficiency issues. 
The new approach proposed in this paper aims at 
merging the constructive and the reductionist ap- 
proaches, so as to maintain the coverage and gran- 
ularity of the constraint-based approach at a much 
lower computational cost. In particular, segments 
(chunks) are defined by constraints rather than pat- 
terns, in order to ensure broader coverage. At the 
same time, segments are defined in a cautious way, 
to ensure that clause boundaries and syntactic func- 
tions (e.g. subject, object, PP-Obj) can be defined 
with a high degree of accuracy. 
2 The  incrementa l  parser  
2.1 Overview 
The input to the parser is a tagged text. We cur- 
rently use a modified version of the Xerox French 
tagger (Chanod, Tapanainen, 1995). The revisions 
are meant to reduce the impact of the most frequent 
errors of the tagger (e.g. errors between adjectives 
and past participles), and to refine the tagset. 
Each input token is assigned a single tag, generally 
representing the part-of-speech and some limited 
morphological information (e.g the number, but not 
the gender of nouns). The sentence is initially rep- 
resented by a sequence of wordform-plus-tag pairs. 
The incremental parser consists of a sequence of 
transducers. These transducers are compiled from 
regular expressions that use finite-state calculus op- 
erators, mainly the Replace operators (Karttunen, 
1996). Each of these transducers adds syntactic in- 
formation represented by reserved symbols (annota- 
tions), such as brackets and names for segments and 
syntactic functions. The application of each trans- 
ducer composes it with the result of previous appli- 
cations. 
If the constraints tipulated in a given transducer 
are not verified, the string remains unchanged. This 
ensures that there is always an output string at the 
end of the sequence, with possibly underspecified 
segments. 
Each transducer performs a specific linguistic 
task. For instance, some networks identify segments 
for NPs, PPs, APs (adjective phrases) and verbs, 
while others are dedicated to subject or object. The 
same task (e.g. subject assignment or verb segmen- 
tation) may be performed by more than one trans- 
ducer. The additional information provided at each 
stage of the sequence is instrumental in the defini- 
tion of the later stages of the sequence. Networks 
are ordered in such a way that the easiest asks are 
addressed first. 
2.2 Non-monotonicity 
The replace operators allow one not only to add in- 
formation but also to modify previously computed 
information. It is thus possible to reassign syntactic 
markings at a later stage of the sequence. This has 
two major usages: 
? assigning some segments with a default marking 
at some stage of the process in order to provide 
preliminary information that is essential to the 
subsequent stages; and correcting the default 
marking later if the context so requires 
? assigning some segments with very general 
marking; and refining the marking later if the 
context so permits. 
In that sense, our incremental parser is non- 
monotonic: earlier decisions may be refined or even 
73 
revised. However, all the transducers can, in prin- 
ciple, be composed into a single transducer which 
produces the final outcome in a single step. 
2.3 Caut ious  segmentat ion  and  syntactic 
marking 
Each transducer defines syntactic onstructions us- 
ing two major operations: segmentation and syn- 
tactic marking. Segmentation consists of bracket- 
ing and labeling adjacent constituents that belong 
to a same partial construction (e.g. a nominal or a 
verbal phrase, or a more primitive/partial syntactic 
chain if necessary). Segmentation also includes the 
identification of clause boundaries. Syntactic mark- 
ing annotates segments with syntactic functions (e.g. 
subject, object, PPObj). 
The two operations, segmentation and syntactic 
marking, are performed throughout the sequence in 
an interrelated fashion. Some segmentations depend 
on previous yntactic marking and vice versa. 
If a construction is not recognized at some point of 
the sequence because the constraints are too strong, 
it can still be recognized at a later stage, using other 
linguistic statements and different background infor- 
mation. This notion of delayed assignment is crucial 
for robust parsing, and requires that each statement 
in the sequence be linguistically cautious. Cautious 
segmentation prevents us from grouping syntacti- 
cally independent segments. 
This is why we avoid the use of simplifying ap- 
proximations that would block the possibility of per- 
forming delayed assignment. For example, unlike 
(Abney, 1991), we do not systematically use longest 
pattern matching for segmentation. Segments are 
restricted by their underlying linguistic indetermi- 
nacy (e.g. post-nominal adjectives are not attached 
to the immediate noun on their left, and coordinated 
segments are not systematically merged, until strong 
evidence is established for their linkage). 
2.4 Incremental parsing and linguistic 
description 
The parsing process is incremental in the sense that 
the linguistic description attached to a given trans- 
ducer in the sequence: 
? relies on the preceding sequence of transducers 
* covers only some occurrences of a given linguis- 
tic phenomenon 
? can be revised at a later stage. 
This has a strong impact on the linguistic char- 
acter of the work. The ordering of the linguistic 
descriptions i in itself a matter of linguistic descrip- 
tion: i.e. the grammarian must split the description 
of phenomena into sub-descriptions, depending on 
the available amount of linguistic knowledge at a 
given stage of the sequence. 
This may sound like a severe disadvantage of the 
approach, as deciding on the order of the transduc- 
ers relies mostly on the grammarian's intuition. But 
we argue that this incremental view of parsing is 
instrumental in achieving robust parsing in a prin- 
cipled fashion. When it comes to parsing, no state- 
ment is fully accurate (one may for instance find ex- 
amples where even the subject and the verb do not 
agree in perfectly correct French sentences). How- 
ever, one may construct statements which are true 
almost everywhere, that is, which are always true in 
some frequently occuring context. 
By identifying the classes of such statements, we 
reduce the overall syntactic ambiguity and we sim- 
plify the task of handling less frequent phenomena. 
The less frequent phenomena apply only to segments 
that are not covered by previous linguistic descrip- 
tion stages. 
To some extent, this is reminiscent of the optimal- 
ity theory, in which: 
? Constraints are ranked; 
? Constraints can be violated. 
Transducers at the top of the sequence are ranked 
higher, in the sense that they apply first, thus block- 
ing the application of similar constructions at a later 
stage in the sequence. 
If  the constraints attached to a given transducer 
are not fulfilled, the transducer has no effect. The 
output annotated string is identical to the input 
string and the construction is bypassed. However, 
a bypassed construction may be reconsidered at a 
later stage, using different linguistic statements. In 
that sense, bypassing allows for the violation of con- 
straints. 
2.5 An  example  o f  inc rementa l  descr ip t ion :  
F rench  Sub jec ts  
As French is typically SVO, the first transducer in 
the sequence to mark subjects checks for NPs on the 
left side of finite verbs. 
Later in the sequence, other transducers allow 
for subject inversion (thus violating the constraint 
on subject-verb order), especially in some specific 
contexts where inversion is likely to occur, e.g. 
within relative or subordinate clauses, or with mo- 
tion verbs. Whenever a transducer defines a verb- 
subject construction, it is implicitly known at this 
74  
stage that the initial subject-verb construction was 
not recognized for that particular clause (other- 
wise, the application of the verb-subject construc- 
tion would be blocked). 
Further down in the sequence, transducers may 
allow for verb-subject constructions outside the 
previously considered contexts. I f  none of these 
subject-pickup constructions applies, the final sen- 
tence string remains underspecified: the output does 
not specify where the subject stands. 
It should be observed that in real texts, not only 
may one find subjects that do not agree with the 
verb (and even in correct sentences), but one may 
also find finite verbs without a subject. This is the 
case for instance in elliptic technical reports (esp. 
failure reports) or on cigarette packs with inscrip- 
tions like Nuit gravement ~la santg 1. 
This is a major feature of shallow and robust 
parsers (Jensen et al, 1993; Ejerhed, 1993): they 
may provide partial and underspecified parses when 
full analyses cannot be performed; the issue of gram- 
maticality is independent from the parsing process; 
the parser identifies the most likely interpretations 
for any given input. 
An additional feature of the incremental parser 
derives from its modular architecture: one may han- 
dle underspecified elements in a tractable fashion, by 
adding optional transducers to the sequence. For in- 
stance, one may use corpus specific transducers (e.g. 
sub-grammars for technical manuals are specially 
useful to block analyses that are linguistically ac- 
ceptable, but unlikely in technical manuals: a good 
example in French is to forbid second person sin- 
gular imperatives in technical manuals as they are 
often ambiguous with nouns in a syntactically unde- 
cidable fashion). One may also use heuristics which 
go beyond the cautious tatements of the core gram- 
mar (to get back to the example of French subjects, 
heuristics can identify any underspecified NP as the 
subject of a finite verb if the slot is available at the 
end of the sequence). How specific grammars and 
heuristics can be used is obviously application de- 
pendent. 
3 Arch i tec ture  
The parser has four main linguistic modules, each of 
them consisting of one or several sequenced trans- 
ducers: 
1 Seriously endangers your health. This example rep- 
resents an interesting case of deixis and at the same time 
a challenge for the POS tagger as Nuit is more likely to 
be recognized as a noun (Night) than as a verb (Endan- 
gers) in this particular context. 
? Primary segmentation 
? Subject tagging 
? Segment expansion (Optional) 
? Other syntactic functions tagging 
The input text is first tagged with part-of-speech 
information using the Xerox tagger. The tagger uses 
44 morphosyntactic tags such as NOUN-SG for sin- 
gular nouns and VERB-P3SG for verb 3rd person 
singular. 
The morphosyntactic tags are used to mark AP, 
NP, PP and VP segments. We then use the segmen- 
tation tags and some additional information (includ- 
ing typography) to mark subjects which, in turn, 
determine to what extent VCs (Verb Chunks) can 
be expanded. Finally, other syntactic functions are 
tagged within the segments. 
Marking transducers are compiled from regular 
expressions of the form A ?-> T1 . . .  T2 that con- 
tains the left-to-right longest match replace opera- 
tor ?-> . Such a transducer marks in a left-to-right 
fashion the maximal instances of A by adding the 
bracketing strings T1 and T2. 
4 P r imary  Segmentat ion  
A segment is a continuous sequence of words that are 
syntactically linked to each other or to a main word 
(the Head). In the primary segmentation step, we 
mark segment boundaries within sentences as shown 
below where NP stands for Noun Phrase, PP for 
Preposition Phrase and VC for Verb Chunk (a VC 
contains at least one verb and possibly some of its 
arguments and modifiers). 
Example :  
\[VC \[VC Lorsqu' \[NP on NP\] tourne VC\] \[NP le 
commutateu.v NP\] \[PP de d4marrage PP\] \[PP sur la 
position PP\] \[AP auxiliaire AP\] , \[NP i' 
aiguille NP\] retourne alors \[PP ~ z4ro PP\] VC\] 
?/SENT 2 
All the words within a segment should be linked to 
words in the same segment at the same level, ex- 
cept the head. For instance, in the NP le commu- 
tateur (the switch), le should be linked to commu- 
tateur (the head) which, in turn, should be linked 
to the verb tourne, and not to the verb retourne be- 
cause the two words are not in the same segment. 
The main purpose of marking segments is therefore 
to constrain the particular linguistic space that de- 
termines the syntactic function of a word. 
2 Turning the starter switch to the auxiliary position, 
the pointer will then return to zero. 
As one can notice from the example above, seg- 
mentation is very cautious, and structural ambiguity 
inherent o modifier attachment (even postnominal 
adjectives), verb arguments and coordination is not 
resolved at this stage. 
In order to get more robust linguistic descriptions 
and networks that compile faster, segments are not 
defined by marking sequences that match classical 
regular expressions of the type \[Det (Coord Det) 
Adj* Noun\], except in simple or heavily constrained 
cases (APs, Infinitives, etc). Rather, we take ad- 
vantage of the fact that, within a linguistic segment 
introduced by some grammatical words and termi- 
nated by the head, there is no attachement ambigu- 
ity and therefore these words can be safely used as 
segment delimiters (Bbs, 1993). We first mark pos- 
sible beginnings and endings of a segment and then 
associate ach beginning tag with an ending if some 
internal constraints are satisfied. Hence, the main 
steps in segmentation are: 
? Tag potential beginnings and ends of a segment 
? Use these temporary tags to mark the segment 
* Remove the temporary tags. 
4.1 AP  Segmentat ion  
Adjective phrases are marked by a replacement 
transducer which inserts the \[AP and AP\]  bound- 
aries around any word sequence that matches the 
regular expression (RE): 
\[ (ADVP) ADJ ( COMMA \[ (ADVP) ADJ 
COMMA \]+ ) ( COORD (ADVP) ADJ ) \] 
ADVP stands for adverb phrase and is defined as: 
\[ ADV+ \[\[COORD\[COMMA\] DV?\]* \] 
4.2 NP  Segmentat ion  
Unlike APs, NPs are marked in two steps where the 
basic idea is the following: we first insert a special 
mark wherever a beginning of an NP is possible, i.e, 
on the left of a determiner, a numeral, a pronoun, 
etc. The mark is called a temporary beginning of 
NP (TBeginNP). The same is done for all possible 
ends of NP (TEndNP), i.e. nouns, numerals, pro- 
nouns, etc. Then, using a replacement transducer, 
we insert the \ [NP and NP\]  boundaries around the 
longest sequence that contains at least one tempo- 
rary beginning of NP followed by one temporary end 
of NP: 
75 
\[TBeginNP -$\[TEndNP\] TEndNP \] @-> 
BeginNP ... EndNP 
This way, we implicitly handle complicated NPs 
such as le ou les responsables ( the-SG or the-PL per- 
son(s) in charge), les trois ou quatre affaires (the 
three or four cases), etc. 
4.3 PP  Segmentat ion  
Once NP boundaries are marked, we insert on the 
left of any preposition a temporary PP beginning 
mark (TBeginPP = <PP) :  
<PP Avec ou <PP sans \[NP le premier 
ministre NP 3\] 
Then the longest sequence containing at least one 
TBeginPP followed by one EndNP is surrounded 
with the \[PP and PP\] boundaries using the RE: 
\[TBeginPP -$ \[EndNPITVerb\] Encl~P\] @-> 
BeginPP . . .  EndPP 
which eventually leads to: 
\[PP Avec ou sans le premier ministre PP\] 
4.4 VC Segmentat ion  
A VC (Verb Chunk) is a sequence containing at least 
one verb (the head). It may include words or seg- 
ments (NPs, PPs, APs or other VCs) that are pos- 
sibly linked as arguments or adjuncts to the verb. 
There are three types of VCs: infinitives, present 
participle phrases and finite verb phrases. We first 
mark infinitives and present participle segments as 
they are simpler than finite verb phrases-they are 
not recursive, they cannot contain other VCs. 
4.4.1 In f in i t i ves  
The infinitive phrases are recognized using the reg- 
ular expression: 
\[(PREPO) (NEG) (ADVP) PC* INF 
\[(ADVP PastPartV+) I PastPartV*\]\] 
e.g.: sans m~me prdvenir (without even warning): 
\[VC \[NP Mr NP\] \[NP Guilhaume NP\] supprime VC\] 
\[PP des ~missions PP\] \[VC sans m~me pr~venir 
VC\] \[NP leurs  responsables NP\] 
4.4.2 P resent  Par t i c ip le  Segments  
The present participle phrases are recognized us- 
ing the regular expression: 
\[ (EN) (NEG) PC* PrePart 
\[(ADVP PastPartV+) \[ PastPartV*\]\] 
e.g.: en ddnongant (while denouncing) 
\[VC en d6non~ant VC\] \[NP les  provocat ions  
NP\] \[ADJ mensong~res ADJ\] 
a With or without the prime minister. 
76 
4.4.3 F in i te  Verb Segments  
Here we use the basic idea described in the NP 
marking: temporary beginnings (TBeginVC) and 
ends (TEndVC) of VC are first marked. 
Temporary beginnings of VCs are usually intro- 
duced by grammatical words such as qui (relative 
pronoun), lorsque, et (coordination) etc. However, 
not all these words are certain VC boundaries: et 
could be an NP coordinator, while que (tagged as 
CONJQUE by the HMM tagger) could be used in 
comparatives (e.g. plus blanc que blanc). Therefore, 
we use three kinds of TBeginVC to handle differ- 
ent levels of uncertainty: a certain TBeginVC (TBe- 
ginVC1), a possible BeginVC (TBeginVC2) and an 
initial TBeginVC (TBeginVCS) automatically in- 
serted at the beginning of every sentence in the input 
text. With TBeginVCS, we assume that the sen- 
tence has a main finite verb, as is usually the case, 
but this is just an assumption that can be corrected 
later. 
A temporary end of VC (TEndVC) is then in- 
serted on the right of any finite verb, and the process 
of recognizing VCs consists of the following steps: 
* Step 1: Each certain TBeginVC1 is matched 
with a TEndVC, and the sequence is marked 
with \[VC and VC\]. The matching is applied 
iteratively on the input text to handle the case 
of embedded clauses (arbitrarily bound to three 
iterations in the current implementations). 
* Step 2: The same is done with the TBeginVCS 
(inserted at the beginning of a sentence). 
? Step 3: If there is still a TEndVC that was not 
matched in (1) or (2), then it is matched with 
a possible TBeginVC2, if any, and the sequence 
is marked with \[VC and VC\]. 
? Step 4: Any TBeginVC that was not matched 
in (1), (2) or (3) is removed.

5 Marking Syntactic Functions 
The process of tagging words and segments with 
syntactic functions is a good example of the 
non-monotonic nature of the parser and its hy- 
brid constructive-reductionnist approach. Syntac- 
tic functions within non recursive segments (AP, NP 
and PP) are addressed first because they are easier 
to tag. Then other functions within verb segments 
and at sentence level (subject, direct object, verb 
modifier, etc.) are considered. 
Potential subjects are marked first: an NP is a 
potential subject if and only if it satisfies ome ty- 
pographical conditions (it should not be separated 
from the verb with only one comma, etc.). This 
prevents the NP Jacques, for example, from being 
marked as a subject in the sentence below: 
\[VC \[NP le president NP\]/SUBJ \[PP du CSA PP\], 
\[NP Jacques NP\] \[NP Boutet NP\] , a d4cid4 VC\] 
\[VC de publier VC\] \[NP la profession NP\] \[PP de 
foi PP\] ./SENT 5 
Then constraints are applied to eliminate some of the 
potential subject candidates. The constraints are 
mainly syntactic: they are about subject uniqueness 
(unless there is a coordination), the necessary shar- 
ing of the subject function among coordinated NPs, 
etc. The remaining candidates are then considered 
as real subjects. The other syntactic functions, such 
as object, PP-Obj, verb modifier, etc. are tagged 
using similar steps. 
5The USA president, Jacques Boutet, decided to 
present his profession of faith. 
77 
6 Expand ing  Verb  Segments  
Because primary segmentation is cautious, verb seg- 
ments end right after a verb in order to avoid arbi- 
trary attachment of argument or adjunct segments 
(NPs, PPs and APs on the right of a verb). How- 
ever, experiments have shown that in some kinds of 
texts, mainly in technical manuals written in a "con- 
trolled language", it is worth applying the "nearest 
attachment" principle. We expand VCs to include 
segments and to consider them as arguments or ad- 
juncts of the VC head. This reduces tructural am- 
biguity in the parser output with a very small error 
rate. For instance, expanding VCs in the sentence 
given in the previous section leads to the following 
structure: 
\[VC \[NP le prfsident NP\]/SUBJ \[PP du CSA PP\], 
\[NP Jacques NP\] \[NP Boutet NP\] , a d~cid~ \[VC 
de publier \[NP la profession NP\] \[PP de foi PP\] 
VC\] VC\] ./SENT 
Nevertheless, as this principle leads to a significant 
number of incorrect attachments in the case of more 
free-style texts, the VC expansion etwork is option- 
ally applied depending on the input text. 
7 Per fo rmance  
As mentioned above, the parser is implemented as 
a sequence of finite state networks. The total size 
of the 14 networks we currently use is about 500 
KBytes of disk space. The speed of analysis is 
around 150 words per second on a SPAP~Cstation 10 
machine running in a development environment that 
we expect o optimize in the future. As for linguistic 
performance, we conducted a preliminary evaluation 
of subject recognition over a technical manual text 
(2320 words, 157 sentences) and newspaper articles 
from Le Monde (5872 words, 249 sentences). The 
precision and recall rates were respectively 99.2% 
and 97.8% in the first case, 92.6% and 82.6% in the 
case of the newspaper articles. This difference in 
performance is due to the fact that, on the one hand, 
we used the technical manual text to develop the 
parser and on the other hand, it shows much less 
rich syntactic structures than the newspaper text. 
We are currently conducting wider experiments to 
evaluate the linguistic accuracy of the parser.

Below are some parsing samples, where the output is 
slightly simplified to make it more readable. In par- 
ticular, morphosyntactic tags are hidden and only

pear.

The incremental finite-state parser presented here 
merges both constructive and reductionist ap- 
proaches. As a whole, the parser is constructive: 
it makes incremental decisions throughout the pars- 
ing process. However, at each step, linguistic on- 
traints may eliminate or correct some of the previ- 
ously added information. Therefore, the analysis is 
non-monotonic and handles uncertainty. 
The linguistic modularity of the system makes it 
tractable and easy to adapt for specific texts (e.g. 
technical manuals or newspaper texts). This is done 
by adding specialized modules into the parsing se- 
quence. This way, the core grammar is clearly 
separated from optional inguistic descriptions and 
heuristics. 
Ongoing work includes expansion of the French 
grammar, a wider evaluation, and grammar devel- 
opment for new languages. We will also experiment 
with our primary target applications, information 
retrieval and translation assistance.
