Abstract
We describe the use of meeting metadata,
acquired using a computerized meeting
organization and note-taking system, to
improve automatic transcription of meet-
ings. By applying a two-step language
model adaptation process based on notes
and agenda items, we were able to re-
duce perplexity by 9% and word error rate
by 4% relative on a set of ten meetings
recorded in-house. This approach can be
used to leverage other types of metadata.
1 Introduction
Automatic transcription of multi-party conversa-
tions such as meetings is one of the most difficult
tasks in automatic speech recognition. In (Morgan
et al, 2003) it is described as an ?ASR-complete?
problem, one that presents unique challenges for ev-
ery component of a speech recognition system.
Though much of the literature on meeting tran-
scription has focused on the unique acoustic mod-
eling and segmentation problems incurred by meet-
ing transcription, language modeling for meetings
is an interesting problem as well. Though meet-
ing speech is spontaneous in nature, the vocabulary
and phrasing in meetings can be very specialized
and often highly technical. Speaking style can vary
greatly between speakers, and the discourse struc-
ture of multi-party interaction gives rise to cross-
speaker effects that are difficult to model with stan-
dard N-gram models (Ji and Bilmes, 2004).
Speech in meetings has one crucial advantage
over many other transcription tasks, namely that it
does not occur in isolation. Meetings are scheduled
and discussed in advance, often via e-mail. People
take notes and create agendas for meetings, and of-
ten read directly from electronic presentation mate-
rials. The structure of meetings can be exploited -
topics can be segmented both temporally and across
speakers, and these shifting topics can be modeled
as sub-languages.
We examine the effect of leveraging one partic-
ular type of external information, namely the writ-
ten agendas and meeting minutes, and we demon-
strate that, by using off-line language model adapta-
tion techniques, these can significantly (p < 0.01)
improve language modeling and speech recognition
accuracy. The language in the notes and agendas is
very similar to that used by the speakers, hence we
consider this to be a form of semi-supervised or im-
plicitly supervised adaptation.
2 Corpus
The SmartNotes system, described in (Banerjee and
Rudnicky, 2007) is a collaborative platform for
meeting organization, recording, and note-taking.
As part of our research into meeting segmentation
and recognition, we have collected a series of 10 un-
scripted meetings using SmartNotes. These meet-
ings themselves are approximately 30 minutes in
length (ranging from 1745 to 7208 words) with three
regular participants, and consist of discussions and
reporting on our ongoing research. The meetings
are structured around the agendas and action items
constructed through the SmartNotes interface. The
73
agenda itself is largely constant from meeting to
meeting, while each meeting typically reviews dis-
cusses the previous week?s action items. Each par-
ticipant is equipped with a laptop computer and an
individual headset microphone.
Each meeting was manually transcribed and seg-
mented for training and testing purposes. The tran-
scription includes speaker identification and timing
information. As part of the meeting, participants are
encouraged to take notes and define action items.
These are automatically collected on a server along
with timestamp information. In (Banerjee and Rud-
nicky, 2007), it was shown that timestamped text of
this kind is useful for topic segmentation of meet-
ings. In this work, we have not attempted to take
advantage of the timing information, nor have we
attempted to perform any topic segmentation. Given
the small quantity of text available from the notes,
we feel that the type of static language model adap-
tation presented here is most feasible when done at
the entire meeting level. A cache language model
(Kuhn and Mori, 1990) may be able to capture the
(informally attested) locality effects between notes
and speech.
Since the notes are naturalistic text, often con-
taining shorthand, abbreviations, numbers, punctu-
ation, and so forth, we preprocess them by running
them through the text-normalization component of
the Festival1 speech synthesis system and extracting
the resulting string of individual words. This yielded
an average of 252 words of adaptation data for each
of the 10 meetings.
3 System Description
Unless otherwise noted, all language models eval-
uated here are trigram models using Katz smooth-
ing (Katz, 1987) and Good-Turing discounting. Lin-
ear interpolation of multiple source models was per-
formed by maximizing the likelihood over a held-out
set of adaptation data.
For automatic transcription, our acoustic mod-
els consist of 5000 tied triphone states (senones),
each using a 64-component Gaussian mixture model
with diagonal covariance matrices. The input fea-
tures consist of 13-dimensional MFCC features,
delta, and delta-delta coefficients. These models

data, consisting of the ICSI meeting corpus (Mor-

pus, the NIST pilot meeting corpus, the WSJ CSR-
0 and CSR-1 corpora,2 the CMU Arctic TTS cor-
pora (Kominek and Black, 2004), and a corpus of 32
hours of meetings previously recorded by our group
in 2004 and 2005.
Our baseline language model is based on a linear
interpolation of source language models built from
conversational and meeting speech corpora, using a
held-out set of previously recorded ?scenario? meet-
ings. These meetings are unscripted, but have a fixed
topic and structure, which is a fictitious scenario in-
volving the hiring of new researchers. The source
language models contain a total of 24 million words
from nine different corpora, as detailed in Table 1.
The ?Regular Meetings? and ?Scenario Meetings?
were collected in-house and consist of the same 32
hours of meetings mentioned above, along with the
remainder of the scenario meetings. We used a vo-
cabulary of 20795 words, consisting of all words
from the locally recorded, ICSI, and NIST meetings,
combined with the Switchboard-I vocabulary (with
the exception of words occurring less than 3 times).
The Switchboard and Fisher models were pruned by
dropping singleton trigrams.
4 Interpolation and Vocabulary Closure
We created one adapted language model for each
meeting using a two-step process. First, the source
language models were re-combined using linear in-
terpolation to minimize perplexity on the set of notes

for each meeting. Next, the vocabulary was ex-
panded using the notes. In order to accomplish
this, a trigram language model was trained from the
notes themselves and interpolated with the output of
the previous step using a small, fixed interpolation
weight ? = 0.1. It should be noted that this also
has the effect of slightly boosting the probabilities
of the N-grams that appear in the notes. We felt this
was useful because, though these probabilities are
not reliably estimated, it is likely that people will use
many of the same N-grams in the notes as in their
meeting speech, particularly in the case of numbers
and acronyms. The results of interpolation and N-
gram closure are shown in Table 2 in terms of test-
set perplexity, and in Table 3 in terms of word error
rate. Using a paired t-test over the 10 meetings, the
improvements in perplexity and accuracy are highly
significant (p < 0.01).
5 Topic Clustering and Dimensionality
Reduction
In examining the interpolation component of the
adaptation method described above, we noticed that
the in-house meetings and the ICSI meetings consis-
tently took on the largest interpolation weights. This
is not surprising since both of these corpora are sim-
ilar to the test meetings. However, all of the source
corpora cover potentially relevant topics, and by in-
terpolating the corpora as single units, we have no
way to control the weights given to individual top-

ics within them. Also, people may use different, but
related, words in writing and speaking to describe
the same topic, but we are unable to capture these
semantic associations between the notes and speech.
To investigate these issues, we conducted sev-
eral brief experiments using a reduced training cor-
pus consisting of 69 ICSI meetings. We converted
these to a vector-space representation using tf.idf
scores and used a deterministic annealing algorithm
(Rose, 1998) to create hard clusters of meetings,
from each of which we trained a source model for
linear interpolation. We compared these clusters to
random uniform partitions of the corpus. The in-
terpolation weights were trained on the notes, and
the models were tested on the meeting transcripts.
Out-of-vocabulary words were not removed from
the perplexity calculation. The results (mean and
standard deviation over 10 meetings) are shown in
Table 4. For numbers of clusters between 2 and
42, the annealing-based clusters significantly out-
perform the random partition. The perplexity with
42 clusters is also significantly lower (p < 0.01)
than the perplexity (256.5? 21.5) obtained by train-
ing a separate source model for each meeting.
To address the second issue of vocabulary mis-
matches between notes and speech, we applied prob-
abilistic latent semantic analysis (Hofmann, 1999)
to the corpus, and used this to ?expand? the vocab-
ulary of the notes. We trained a 32-factor PLSA
model on the content words (we used a simple

entropy-based pruning to identify these ?content
words?) from the ICSI meeting vocabulary. To adapt
the language model, we used the ?folding-in? proce-
dure described in (Hofmann, 1999), running an iter-
ation of EM over the notes to obtain an adapted un-
igram distribution. We then simply updated the uni-
gram probabilities in the language model with these
new values and renormalized. While the results,
shown in Table 5, show a statistically significant im-
provement in perplexity, this adaptation method is
is problematic, as it increases the probability mass
given to all the words in the PLSA model. In subse-
quent results, also shown in Table 5, we found that
simply extracting these words from the original un-
igram distribution and boosting their probabilities
by the equivalent amount also reduces perplexity
by nearly as much (though the difference from the
PLSA model is statistically significant, p = 0.004).
6 Conclusions
We have shown that notes collected automatically
from participants in a structured meeting situation
can be effectively used to improve language mod-
eling for automatic meeting transcription. Further-
more, we have obtained some encouraging results
in applying source clustering and dimensionality re-
duction to make more effective use of this data. In
future work, we plan to exploit other sources of
metadata such as e-mails, as well as the structure of
the meetings themselves.
