I. INTRODUCTION 
A. Overview of the Paper 
In an age of increased attention to the 
problems of database organization re t r ieva l  
problems and query languages, one o f  the major 
economic problems of  many potent ia l  databases 
remains the entry of the original information into 
the database. A large amount of such information 
is currently available in natural language text, 
and some of that text is of a higi~ly stylized 
nature, with a restricted semantic domain. It is 
the task of specialized information extract ion 
(SIE) systems to obtain information automatically 
from such texts  and place i t  in the database. As 
with any system, it is desirable to minimize 
errors and human intervention, bur a total absence 
of either i s  not necessary for the system to be 
economically viabl~.

In ~his paper, we will first discuss some 
general characterlstics of SIE systems, then 
descr ibe  the  deve lopment  of an experimental sys tem 
to assist in the coastructlon of a database of 
chemical reaction information. Many Journals, 
such as the Journal of Or~anlc Chemistry, have 
separate experimental sections, in which ~he 
procedures  fo r  p repar ing  chemica l  compounds are  
descr ibed .  I t  i s  des i red  to ext rac t  cer ta in  
in fo rmat ion  about  these  react ions  and p lace  i t  in  
the  database .  A react ion  in fo rmat ion  form (RIF) 
was deve loped  in another  p ro jec t  to conta in  the  
des i red  information. The purpose of the system is 
tO eliminate the necessity in a majority of 
cases ,  fo r  a t ra ined  reader  to read the text and 
enter  the  P.IF in fo rmat ion  in to  the  mach ine .  
B. Some Termino logy  
In the discussion below, we shall use the 
term ~rammmr to mean a system conslstin 8 of a 
lexicon s a s~ntax, a meanin~ representation lan- 
guage, and a z~nt lc  mapping. The lexicon 
consists of the ~st  of words in the language and 
one or more grammatical categories for each word. 
The syntax specifies the structure of sentences in 
the language in terms of the  grammar ical 
categories. Morphological procedures may specify 
a "syntax" within classes of words and thereby 
reduce the size of the lexicon. A discourse 
s t ruc ture ,  or extrasentential syntax, may also be 
inc luded.  
The semantic mapping provides ~oc each 
syntact ical ly correct sentence a meaning repre- 
sentation in  the  meaning representat ion  language,  
and it is the  crux of the  whole system. ~f the 
semantic mapping is fundamentally straightforward, 
then the syntactic processing can often be 
reduced, as well. This is one of the virtues o~ 
SIt systems: Because Of the specialized sub jec t  
matter, one can simplify syntactic process \ [n~ 
through the  use of ad hoc procedures  (e i ther  
algorithmic or heuristic). In many ca~es ,  t:he 
knowledge that allows this is nonlinguist ic 
knowledge, which may be encoded tn frames. 
Although this is not always the sense in which 
"frame" is used, this is the sense in which we 
shall use the term in our discussion below: 
Frames encode non l tngu ls t i c  "expectat ions"  brouRht 
to bear on the task. ~n this light, it is inter- 
esting to ~xplore the subject of case-slot Iden- 
tity, as raised by Charnlak (\[981). if the slots 
are components of framesmand cases are names for 
arguments of a predicate, then the slots in any 
practical language understanding system may not 
correspond exactly co the cases in a language. \[n 
fact. the predicates may not  correspond to the 
frames. On the other hand, if the language is 
capable of expressing all of the dlstinctio~m that 
can be understood in terms of the frames, one 
would expect them to grow closer and closer as the 
system became less specialized. The decision as 
to whether to maintain the distinction between 
predlcat e/case and frame/slot has a "Whor flan" 
flavor to it. We have chosen to maintain that 
dis c Inct ion. 
Despite the general decision with regards  
to predicates and slots, some of the grammatical 
categories in our work do not correspond precisely 
to conventional grammatical categories, but are 
specialized for the reaction information project. 
An example i s  "chemical name", This illustrates 
another reason that SIE systems are more practical 
than  more general language understanding systems: 
One can use certain ad hoc categories based  upon 
the characteristics of the problem (and of the 
underlying meanings represented). This idea was 
advocated several years ago by Thompson (\[966) and 
used in the design of a specialized database query 
system ( DFACON). Its problem in more general 
language processing appllcac ions - that the 
categories may not extend readily from one domain 
to another and may actually complicate the general 
grammar - does not  cause as much difficulty in the 
SIE case. The danger of using ad hoc categories 
is, of course, that one can lose extensibility, 
and must make careful decisions in advance as to 
how specialized the SIE system is going to be. 
II. SPECIALIZED INFORMATION EXTRACTION 
A. Characteristics of the SIr Task 
The term "specialized information extrac- 
tion" is necessarily a relative one. Information 
extraction can range from the simplest sorts of 
tasks like obtaining all names of people men- 
Cloned in newspaper articles, to a full under- 
standing of relatively free text. The simplest of 
these require of the program little linguistic or 
empirical knowledge, while the most complex 
require more knowledge than we know how to lye. 
But when we refer to an SIE task, we will mean one 
that." 
(l) Deals with a restricted subject 
matter  
(2)  Requires Information chat can be 
classified under a limited number of 
discrete parameters, and 
(3) Deals with language of a specialized 
type, usually nar ra t ive  reports. 
SIE programs are more feasible than  
automatic translation because the restrictions 
lessen the ambiguity problems. This is even true 
in comparison to other tasks with a restricted 
subject matter, such as natural language computer 
programmln 8 or database query. Furthermore, these 
latter tasks require a very low error rate in 
order co be useful, because users will not 
tolerate either ineorrect results or constant  
queries and requeSts for rewording from the 
program, while SIr programs would be successful if 
they produced results in, say, 80% of cases and 
required that the information extraction be done 
by humans In the ochers. Even small rat:es of 
undetected errors would be tolerable in many 
sicuatlons, though one would wish co minimize 
them 
The lessened syntactic variety in SIE 
tasks means that the amount of syntactic analysis 
needed is lessened, and also the complexity of the 
machinery for the semantic mapping. At the same 
time, the specialized semantic domain allows the 
use of empirical knowledge to increase the 
efficiency and effectiveness of analysis proce- 
dures (the lessening of ambiguity being only one 
aspect of this). 
The particular cases of SIr that we have 
chosen are highly structured paragraphs, describ- 
ing laboratory procedures for synthesizing organic 
substances which were taken from =he experimental 
section of articles in J. Or\[. Chem. Our feeling 
is that the full text of chemical articles is 
beyond the state of the SIr art, if one wants to 
extract anything more than trivial information; 
hut the limited universe of discourse of the 
experimental paragraphs renders SIr on them 
fens i b le.

B. The En~lneer ins  of SIE STsteaw 
S ince the  days of the  ear ly  mechan ica l  
t rans la t ion  e f fo r ts ,  the  amount of s tudy  of 
natura l  l anguage phenomena, both  from the  po in t  of 
v iew of  pure theory  and of determin ing  spec i f i c  
fac ts  about languages ,  has been substant ia l .  
S imi la r ly ,  techn iques  fo r  dea l ing  w i th  languages  
and o ther  sor ts  of complex in fo rmat ion  by computer  
have been cons iderab ly  extended and the  work has 
been fac i l i ta ted  by the  prov is ion  of h igher - leve l  
programming languages  and by the  ava i lab i l i ty  of 
fas ter  machines and increased  s torage .  Never-- 
che lsea ,  the  s ta te  of sc ie~e i f i c  knowledge of 
language and of p rocesses  fo r  u t i l i z ing  that  
knowledge i s  s t i l l  such that  i t  i s  necessary  Co 
take  an "eng ineer ing  approach"  to the  des ign  of 
comp~at toua l  l ingu is t i cs  systems. 
In us ing  the  term "engineering", we mean 
to indicate that comprouises have to be made in 
the des ign  of the system between what is  theoret i -  
ca l l y  des i rab le ,  and what is  feas ib le  at  the s ta te  
of the ar t .  Fa i l ing  to have a complete  grammar of 
the  language over  which one w ishes  to have STE, 
one uses heur i s t i cs  to determine  features  that  one 
wants .  At the  same t ime,  one uses the  sc ient i f i c  
knowledge ava i lab le ,  inso far  as that  i s  feas ib le .  
One bu i lds  and tes ts  model or  p i lo t  sys tem to 
exp lore  problems and techn iques  and t r ies  co 
ext rapo la te  the  exper ience  to  product ion  sys tems,  
which themselves are likely ~o have to be 
"incrementally developed". 
In any engineering rout  ext, eva luat ion  
measures a re  impor tant .  These measures  a l low one 
Co set criteria for acceptability of designs which 
are likely always to be imperfect, and to compare 
alternative systemS.  The ultimate evaluation 
~easure on which management decisions rest is 
usually cosc/benefi~ ratio. This can be decer- 
mined only after examining the h,~an alternatives 
and their effectiveness. It is important to be 
able Co quantify these alternatives, and this is 
often not done. For instance, it is common to 
assume chat an automaclc system should not produce 
errors, whereas humans always do; so the percent- 
age of errors should be determined experimentally 
in  each case  and compared. 
For the  eva luat ion  of SIE sys tems,  we 
would l i ke  to  propose  three  measures ;  
(1)  Robustness  - the  percentage  of 
inputs  hand led .  Most rea l  SIE sys -  
cm wi l l  re jec t  cer ta in  inputs ,  so 
the  rob~tness  ~r l l l  be one minus the  
parc4n~ags  re jec ted .  
(2) Accuracy the  percentage  of  
those  inputs  hand led  which are  cor -  
rec t ly  hand led .  
(3) E r ro r  ra te  - the  percentage  of 
e r ronao~ ent r ies  w i th in  incor rec t ly  
an  hand led  input .  
P robab ly  the  most d i f f i cu l t  aspect  of SIE 
eng inear inE  i s  the  prov is ion  of a sa fe ty  fac tor  - 
an  ab i l i ty  o f  the  sys tem to recogn ize  inputs  that  
i t  cannot  hand le .  I t  i s  c lear  that  one can c reate  
a sys tem that  i s  robust  and acceptab ly  accurate  
which has unacceptab le  e r ror  ra tes  fo r  cer ta in  
inputs .  I f  the  sys tem i s  to be use fu l ,  i t  must be 
poss ib le  aueOmaeica l l~  to determine  which docu-  
ments conta in  unacceptab le  e r ror  ra tes .  I t  does 
no good to determine  th i s  manua l ly ,  s ince  chac 
~ould nan  assent ia l l y  redo ing  a l l  of  the in fo r -  
: sc ion  ext rac t ion  m~nual 1y, and the  space of 
'doc, ments Is not su f f i c ient ly  uniform or con- 
t inuous thaC sampling methods would do any good. 
I t  appears, then,  that  the only way that  one is 
going to be able co provide a safety  fac tor  is to 
have a system chat understands enough about the 
linguistic and nonllngulstlc aspects of the texts 
to know when it is not understanding (at least 
most of the time). We shall have more co say 
about the safety factor when we discuss our system 
below. 
One suggestion often made for "int el- 
l Igenc" systems is thac they be given some 
provision for improving their performance by 
"learning". Generally the problem with chls 
suggestion is chat the complexity of the learning 
process is greater than chac of the original 
system, and it is also unclear in many cases what 
the machine needs to learn. It nevertheless seems 
feasible for SIE systems to learn by Interaction 
with people who are dolng information extraction 
tasks. The simplest case of this would be .~u 8- 
mentinK the lexicon, but ochers should be pos- 
sible. The first step in chls process would be co 
I I I  
build in a sufficient sa fe ty  factor that  most 
incorrectly handled doc~anents can be explicitly 
rejected. The second would be Co localize the 
factors that caused the rejection sufficiently to 
be ab le  to ask fo r  help from the  person  doing the  
manual ext rac t ion  process .  A l though we have 
cons idered  th i s  aspect  of SIE development,  we have 
oct  made any at tempt  to implement i t .  
A. The Descr ip t ion  of ChmLtcal React ions  
A par t i cu la r  task  that  would appear  to be 
a cand idate  fo r  STY, under the c r i te r ia  g iven  
above,  l s  the ext rac t ion  of in fo rmat ion  on chemi-  
cal  react ions  from exper imenta l  sect ions  of  chemi-  
ca l  Journals. The Journal chosen for our 
experimental work was the Journal of Or~anlc 
Chemistry,. Two examples of reaction descriptions 
from this Journal are shown in Figure 1. Both of 
these examples have a particular type of discourse 
structure, which we have called the "simple 
model". The paragraphs  in the figure (hut not in  
the actual texts) are div ided into four com- 
ponents: a heading, a synthesis, a work-upm and a 
characterization. Usually, the heading names the 
substance that is produced in the reaction, the 
synthesis porclon describes the steps followed in 
conducting the reaction, the work-up poL~lon 
describes the recovery  of the substance from the 
reaction mixture, and the characterization portion 
presents analytical data suppoL~Ing the structure 
assignment. Most of the information that we wish 
to obtain Is in the synthesis port l on, which 
describes the chemical reactants, reaction con- 
dltlons and apparatus. 
Figure 2 shows the Reaction Information 
Form (R/F) designed to hold the required reaction 
information, with information supplied for the two 
paragraphs illustrated in Figure 1. One point to 
notice i s  that not every piece of data is con- 
tained in every reaction description. Thus there 
are blanks Ln both examples, corresponding to 
\[nformar~.~,~ l~Ct u~speclfled in the corresponding 
r'~.rt~.~* des~:rlptions (those shown in Figure L). 
B. An ~I~ S~5t~n for Reaction Information 
\[. General Or~anlzation 
The chemical reaction SIE is written in 
PL/I and runs on a 370/168 under TSO. The t~stlng 
of certain of the algorithms and heuristics has 
been done using SNOBOLA (SPITBOL) running under 
UNIX on a POP L I /70 .  The cho ice  of PL/ I  on the 
370 was d ic ta ted  by pract i ca l  cons iderat ions  
involving the availability of textual m~Cerl~l ,  
the unusual format of that material, and the 
ava i lab i l i ty  of ex is t ing  PL / I  rout ines  to deal 
with  that  fo rmat ,  
The prosraum comprising each stage of the 
system are implemented modularly. Thus the lexi- 
ca l  s tage  invo lves  separate  passes  fo r  ind iv idua l  
l ex ica l  ca tegor ies .  In  some cases, these are not  
order-lndependent. In the syntactic phase, the 
individual modules are "word experts", and in the 
last (extraction) phase ,  they are individual 
"frames" or components of f rames ,  
2. The Lex ica l  StaGe 
In the lexical stage, both dictionary 
lookup and morphological analysis are used to 
classify words. Morphological analysis procedures 
include suf fix normalization, stemming and root  
word lookup and analysis of internal p,mc~itation. 
Chemical substances may be identified by complex 
words and phrases, and are therefore surprisingly 
difficult to isolate& 
Both lexical and syntactic means are used 
to isolate and tag chemical names. In  the lexlcal 
stage, identifiable chemical roots, such as "benz" 
and terms, such as "Iso-" are tagged. In the 
syntactic stage, a procedure uses clues such as 
parenthetical expressions, internal commas and the 
occurrence of Juxtaposed chemical roots to iden- 
tify chemical names. This is really morphology, 
of course. It also uses the overall syntax of the 
sentence to check whether a substance name is 
expected and to dellmlt the chemical name. 
3. The Syntactic Stase  
Chemical substances which comprise the 
reactants and the products of a chemical reaction, 
as well as the reaction conditions and yield, are 
identified by a hierarchical application of proce- 
dures. The syntactic stage of the system has been 
implemented by application of word exper t  p roce-  
dures  to the data structures built durittg the 
lex~cal  stage. 
The word experts are based upon the !~s  
of Rieger and Small (1979) but It has not h 
found to be necessary to ';~? the full complexity 
of their model, so this system's word expe ls  have

turned out to resemble a s tandard  procedura l  
imp lementat ion  (Wlnograd, 1971) (based most ly  on 
par t i cu la r  words or  word categor ies ,  however) .  
The i r  funct ion  is  to determine the ro le  of a word 
taking lexical and syntactic context into con- 
sideration. The word expeL'l: approach was ini- 
tially chosen because it enables the implemen- 
tation of fragments of a grammar and does not 
requ i re  the development of a comprehens ive  gram- 
mar.  S ince i r re levant  por t ions  can be ident i f ied  
by reliable heuristics and eliminated, this 
attribute is partlcularly useful in the SIE con- 
text. The procedures also allow the incorporation 
of heuristics for isolat Ing cer~aln items of 
interest. 
In this context, it might be maintained 
that the interface between the syntax and the 
semantic mapping is even less clean than in cer- 
tain other systems. This is intentional. BecauSe 
of the specialized nature of the process, we have 
implemented the "semantic counterpar~ of syntax" 
concept, as advocated by Thompson (1966), where we 
judged that it would not impair the generality of 
the system within the area of reaction descrip- 
tions. We have tried not to make decisions that 
would make it difficult to extend the system to 
descriptions of reactions that do not obey the 
"simple model". The advantages of this approach 
were discused in Sect ion  I .  
The system pays particular attention to verb 
arguments, which are generally marked by 
prepositions This "case" type analysis gives 
pretty good direct clues to the function of items 
within the meaning representation. Sentencu 
structure is  relatively regular, though ext raposed  
phrases and a few types of clauses must be dealt 
with. Fortunately, the results, in terms of 
function of chemicals and reaction conditions, are 
the same whether the verb form is in an embedded 
clause or the ~ain verb of the sentence. Zn other 
words, we do not have to deal with the nuances 
implied by higher predicates, or with implicative 
verbs, presuppositions, and the llke. 
4. The Semantic Sta~e 
The semantic mapping could be directly to 
the components of the react ion  information form, 
and that is the approach that was implemented in 
the first programs.  This gave reasonable results 
in some tes t  cases, but appeared co be less exten- 
slble to other models of reaction description than 
IL4 
was desirable. A SNOBOL4 version maps the syntax 
to a predicate-arg,.ment formalism, with a case 
frame for each verb designating the posslbte 
~rguments for each pred icate .  
5, The Extraction Sta~e 
The meaning representat ion  gives a pret ty  
c lear  ind icat ion  of the  funct ion  of i tems w i th in  
the RIF in  the s imple  model .  S ince we wadted to 
experiment wlth generality in this system, we 
wished to separate general knowledge from linguis- 
tic knowledge, and fo r  that  reason ,  the  ac tua l  
ext rac t ion  of i tems i s  done us ing  the  frame tech-  
n ique (Minaky, 1975; Charn iak ,  1975). 
In the literature, frames and similar 
devices vary both in their format and in their 
function. Tn some cases, the information that 
they encode is still linguistic, at  least in part. 
We are using them in the "nonllngulstlc" sense, as 
discussed in Section I. ~n our system, frames 
encode the expectations that  a trained reader 
would brin E to the task of extracting information 
from synthetic descriptions, involving the usual 
structure of these descriptions. 
A frame is being developed initially for 
the simple model. This frame looks for the syn- 
thesis section, dlsc~ rd ing work-up and charac- 
r ,~ ' .?  ': j~l,~,\[ ~. -} ~;',~ . j : jv~.- , . I~j .  ~.L r .hen  focuses  on  
the synthesis, whe -~' subframes correspond to the 
particular entrle~ :~eeded in the RIF. 
As one example, the "time" frame expects 
to find a series of re~=tlon step times in the 
description. These are already labelled "time", 
and the frame will know that it has to total them. 
making approximations of such time expressions as 
"overnight" and indicating that the total tS then 
approximate. Another example is the "temperature" 
frame, which expects a series of temperatures, and 
must calculate the minimum and maximum, in order 
to specify a range. Again, a certain amount of 
specialized knowledge, such as the temperature 
indicated by an ice water bat~, is necessary. 
C. Evaluation of the S~s~em 
As of the date of this paper, we have only 
experimented with the version of the system that 
maps directly from the syntax into componu.: ~ 
the react ion  coding form. As noted above, th i s  
vers ion  does not have the genera l i ty  that  we 
des i re ,  but  gives a pret ty  good ind icat ion  of the  
capabilities of the system, as now Implemented. 
Am a tes t  of the system, we ran i t  on 
f i f ty  synthet ic  paragraphs  from the exper imenta l  
sect ions  of the J ourna l  of 0rsan ic  Ch ,~st ry ,  and 
th i r ty -s ix  were processed sat i s fac tor i l y .  Four 
had c lear ,  detectab le  problems,  so the  robustness  
was 92%, but the accuracy was only 78%, since ten 
of the paragraphs did not follow the simple model, 
and were never the less  processed .  Since these  were 
fu l l  of e r rors ,  we did not t ry  to compute a f igure  
fo r  average er ror  ra te .  
Although the ob jec t ive  of  bu i ld ing  th i s  
exper imenta l  system was only to deal  wi th  the  
s imple  model,  the exerc i se  has made c lear  to us 
the importance of the sa fe ty  fac tor  in making a 
system such as thls useful. We in tend to continua 
work with the present system only for a few weekS, 
meanwhile considering the problems and promises of 
extending i t .

by the Operating Systems Division of Logicon

IV. RELATION TO SOME OTHER SIE SYSTEMS 
The problem chat we have had concerning 
the safety factor is one chat is likely to be 
found in any $IE system, but i? is soluble we 
feel. Even though we have not completed work on 
this experimental system as of the time of writing 
this paper (we have found more syntactic and 
semantic procedures ro be implemented), we already 
have ideas as ?o how to build in a better safety 
factor. Generally, these can be characterized as 
using some of the information chat can be gleaned 
by a comblnat ion of llnguls tic and chemical 
knowledge which we had ignored as redundant. 
While It is redundant in "successful" cases, it 
produces conf l i c ts  tn other cases, ind icat ing  that  
something is wrong, and that  the document should 
be processed b? hand. 
If the safety Eactor can be improved, SIE 
systems offer a promising area of application of 
computational  ? ingulst  tcs rechnl ques. C lear \ [? ,  
nothing less than computat ional  l ingu is t i cs  tech- 
niques show any hope of provid ing a reasonable 
safety  fac tor  -o r  ever adequare robustness and 
accuracy, 
The promise of the SIE area has been 
recognized by other researchers. Systems that
