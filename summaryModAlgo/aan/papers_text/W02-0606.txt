Abstract
We present an algorithm that takes an
unannotated corpus as its input, and re-
turns a ranked list of probable morpho-
logically related pairs as its output. The
algorithm tries to discover morphologi-
cally related pairs by looking for pairs
that are both orthographically and seman-
tically similar, where orthographic simi-
larity is measured in terms of minimum
edit distance, and semantic similarity is
measured in terms of mutual information.
The procedure does not rely on a mor-
pheme concatenation model, nor on dis-
tributional properties of word substrings
(such as affix frequency). Experiments
with German and English input give en-
couraging results, both in terms of pre-
cision (proportion of good pairs found at
various cutoff points of the ranked list),
and in terms of a qualitative analysis of
the types of morphological patterns dis-
covered by the algorithm.
1 Introduction
In recent years, there has been much interest in com-
putational models that learn aspects of the morphol-
ogy of a natural language from raw or structured
data. Such models are of great practical interest as
tools for descriptive linguistic analysis and for mini-
mizing the expert resources needed to develop mor-
phological analyzers and stemmers. From a theo-
retical point of view, morphological learning algo-
rithms can help answer questions related to human
language acquisition.
In this study, we present a system that, given a
corpus of raw text from a language, returns a ranked
list of probable morphologically related word pairs.
For example, when run with the Brown corpus as
its input, our system returned a list with pairs such
as pencil/pencils and structured/unstructured at the
top.
Our algorithm is completely knowledge-free, in
the sense that it processes raw corpus data, and it
does not require any form of a priori information
about the language it is applied to. The algorithm
performs unsupervised learning, in the sense that it
does not require a correctly-coded standard to (iter-
atively) compare its output against.
The algorithm is based on the simple idea that a
combination of formal and semantic cues should be
exploited to identify morphologically related pairs.
In particular, we use minimum edit distance to mea-
sure orthographic similarity,1 and mutual informa-
tion to measure semantic similarity. The algo-
rithm does not rely on the notion of affix, and it
does not depend on global distributional properties
of substrings (such as affix frequency). Thus, at
least in principle, the algorithm is well-suited to
discover pairs that are related by rare and/or non-
concatenative morphological processes.
The algorithm returns a list of related pairs, but
it does not attempt to extract the patterns that relate
the pairs. As such, it can be used as a tool to pre-

compute phonetic similarity instead of orthographic similarity.

further discussion of possible applications.
We tested our model with German and English
input. Our results indicate that the algorithm is
able to identify a number of pairs related by a va-
riety of derivational and inflectional processes with
a remarkably high precision rate. The algorithm is
also discovering morphological relationships (such
as German plural formation with umlaut) that would
probably be harder to discover using affix-based ap-
proaches.
The remainder of the paper is organized as fol-
lows: In section 2, we shortly review related work.
In section 3, we present our model. In section 4, we
discuss the results of experiments with German and
English input. Finally, in section 5 we summarize
our main results, we sketch possible directions that
our current work could take, and we discuss some
potential uses for the output of our algorithm.
2 Related work
For space reason, we discuss here only three ap-
proaches that are closely related to ours. See, for
example, Goldsmith (2001) for a very different (pos-
sibly complementary) approach, and for a review of
other relevant work.
2.1 Jacquemin (1997)
Jacquemin (1997) presents a model that automati-
cally extracts morphologically related forms from a
list of English two-word medical terms and a corpus
from the medical domain.
The algorithm looks for correspondences between
two-word terms and orthographically similar pairs
of words that are adjacent in the corpus. For exam-
ple, the list contains the term artificial ventilation,
and the corpus contains the phrase artificially ven-
tilated. Jacquemin?s algorithm thus postulates the
(paired) morphological analyses artificial ventilat-
ion and artificial-ly ventilat-ed.
Similar words, for the purposes of this pairing
procedure, are simply words that share a common
left substring (with constraints that we do not dis-
cuss here).
Jacquemin?s procedure then builds upon these
early steps by clustering together sets that follow the
same patterns, and using these larger classes to look
for spurious analyses. Finally, the algorithm tries to
cluster classes that are related by similar, rather than
identical, suffixation patterns. Again, we will not
describe here how this is accomplished.
Our basic idea is related to that of Jacquemin, but
we propose an approach that is more general both
in terms of orthography and in terms of semantics.
In terms of orthography, we do not require that two
strings share the left (or right) substring in order to
constitute a candidate pair. Thus, we are not limited
to affixal morphological patterns. Moreover, our al-
gorithm extracts semantic information directly from
the input corpus, and thus it does not require a pre-
compiled list of semantically related pairs.
2.2 Schone and Jurafsky (2000)
Schone and Jurafsky (2000) present a knowledge-
free unsupervised model in which orthography-
based distributional cues are combined with seman-
tic information automatically extracted from word
co-occurrence patterns in the input corpus.
They first look for potential suffixes by search-
ing for frequent word-final substrings. Then, they
look for potentially morphologically related pairs,
i.e., pairs that end in potential suffixes and share the
left substring preceding those suffixes. Finally, they
look, among those pairs, for those whose semantic
vectors (computed using latent semantic analysis)
are significantly correlated. In short, the idea behind
the semantic component of their model is that words
that tend to co-occur with the same set of words,
within a certain window of text, are likely to be se-
mantically correlated words.
While we follow Schone and Jurafsky?s idea of
combining orthographic and semantic cues, our al-
gorithm differs from them in both respects. From the
point of view of orthography, we rely on the com-
parison between individual word pairs, without re-
quiring that the two pairs share a frequent affix, and
indeed without requiring that they share an affix at
all.
From the point of view of semantics, we compute
scores based on mutual information instead of latent
semantic analysis. Thus, we only look at the co-
occurrence patterns of target words, rather than at
the similarity of their contexts.
Future research should try to assess to what extent
these two approaches produce significantly different
results, and/or to what extent they are complemen-
tary.
2.3 Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000)
Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000) propose an algo-
rithm that extracts morphological rules relating roots
and inflected forms of verbs (but the algorithm can
be extended to other morphological relations).
Their algorithm performs unsupervised, but not
completely knowledge-free, learning. It requires
a table of canonical suffixes for the relevant parts
of speech of the target language, a list of the con-
tent word roots with their POS (and some informa-
tion about the possible POS/inflectional features of
other words), a list of the consonants and vowels of
the language, information about some characteristic
syntactic patterns and, if available, a list of function
words.
The algorithm uses a combination of different
probabilistic models to find pairs that are likely to be
morphologically related. One model matches root
+ inflected form pairs that have a similar frequency
profile. Another model matches root + inflected
form pairs that tend to co-occur with the same sub-
jects and objects (identified using simple regular ex-
pressions). Yet another model looks for words that
are orthographically similar, in terms of a minimum
edit distance score that penalizes consonant changes
more than vowel changes. Finally, the rules relating
stems and inflected forms that the algorithm extracts
from the pairs it finds in an iteration are used as a
fourth probabilistic model in the subsequent itera-
tions.
Yarowsky and Wicentowski show that the al-
gorithm is extremely accurate in identifying En-
glish root + past tense form pairs, including those
pairs that are related by non-affixal patterns (e.g.,
think/thought.)
The main issue with this model is, of course, that
it cannot be applied to a new target language with-
out having some a priori knowledge about some of
its linguistic properties. Thus, the algorithm can-
not be applied in cases in which the grammar of
the target language has not been properly described
yet, or when the relevant information is not available
for other reasons. Moreover, even when such infor-
mation is in principle available, trying to determine
to what extent morphology could be learned with-
out relying on any other knowledge source remains
an interesting theoretical pursuit, and one whose an-
swer could shed some light on the problem of human
language acquisition.
3 The current approach: Morphological
relatedness as a function of orthographic
and semantic similarity
The basic intuition behind the model presented here
is extremely simple: Morphologically related words
tend to be both orthographically and semantically
similar. Obviously, there are many words that are or-
thographically similar, but are not morphologically
related; for example, blue and glue. At the same
time, many semantically related words are not mor-
phologically related (for example, blue and green).
However, if two words have a similar shape and a
related meaning (e.g., green and greenish), they are
very likely to be also morphologically related.
In order to make this idea concrete, we use min-
imum edit distance to identify words that are ortho-
graphically similar, and mutual information between
words to identify semantically related words.
3.1 Outline of the procedure
Given an unannotated input corpus, the algorithm
(after some elementary tokenization) extracts a list
of candidate content words. This is simply a list
of all the alphabetic space- or punctuation-delimited
strings in the corpus that have a corpus frequency
below .01% of the total token count.2
Preliminary experiments indicated that our proce-
dure does not perform as well without this trimming.
Notice in any case that function words tend to be of
little morphological interest, as they display highly
lexicalized, often suppletive morphological patterns.
The word list extracted as described above and the
input corpus are used to compute two lists of word
pairs: An orthographic similarity list, in which the
2In future versions of the algorithm, we plan to make this
high frequency threshold dependent on the size of the input cor-
pus.
pairs are scored on the basis of their minimum edit
distance, and a semantic similarity list, based on mu-
tual information. Because of minimum thresholds
that are enforced during the computation of the two
measures, neither list contains all the pairs that can
in principle be constructed from the input list.
Before computing the combined score, we get rid
of the pairs that do not occur in both lists (the ra-
tionale being that we do not want to guess the mor-
phological status of a pair on the sole basis of ortho-
graphic or semantic evidence).
We then compute a weighted sum of the ortho-
graphic and semantic similarity scores of each re-
maining pair. In the experiments reported below, the
weights are chosen so that the maximum weighted
scores for the two measures are in the same order
of magnitude (we prefer to align maxima rather than
means because both lists are trimmed at the bottom,
making means and other measures of central ten-
dency less meaningful).
The pairs are finally ranked on the basis of the
resulting combined scores.
In the next subsections, we describe how the or-
thographic and semantic similarity lists are con-
structed, and some properties of the measures we
adopted.
3.2 Scoring the orthographic similarity of
word pairs
Like Yarowsky and Wicentowski, we use mini-
mum edit distance to measure orthographic simi-
larity. The minimum edit distance between two
strings is the minimum number of editing oper-
ations (insertion, deletion, substitution) needed to
transform one string into the other (see section 5.6
of Jurafsky and Martin (2000) and the references
quoted there).
Unlike Yarowsky and Wicentowski, we do not at-
tempt to define a phonologically sensible edit dis-
tance scoring function, as this would require making
assumptions about how the phonology of the target
language maps onto its orthography, thus falling out-
side the domain of knowledge-free induction. In-
stead, we assign a cost of 1 to all editing operations,
independently of the nature of the source and target
segments. Thus, in our system, the pairs dog/Dog,
man/men, bat/mat and day/dry are all assigned a
minimum edit distance of 1.3
Rather than computing absolute minimum edit
distance, we normalize this measure by dividing
it by the length of the longest string (this corre-
sponds to the intuition that, say, two substitutions
are less significant if we are comparing two eight-
letter words than if we are comparing two three-
letter words). Moreover, since we want to rank pairs
on the basis of orthographic similarity, rather than
dissimilarity, we compute (1 - normalized minimum
edit distance), obtaining a measure that ranges from
1 for identical forms to 0 for forms that do not share
any character.
This measure is computed for all pairs of words in
the potential content word list. However, for reasons
of size, only pairs that have a score of .5 or higher
(i.e., where the two members share at least half of
their characters) are recorded in the output list.
Notice that orthographic similarity does not favor
concatenative affixal morphology over other types
of morphological processes. For example, the pairs
woman/women and park/parks both have an ortho-
graphic similarity score of .8.
Moreover, orthographic similarity depends only
on the two words being compared, and not on global
distributional properties of these words and their
substrings. Thus, words related by a rare morpho-
logical pattern can have the same score as words
related by a very frequent pattern, as long as the
minimum edit distance is the same. For example,
both nucleus/nuclei and bench/benches have an or-
thographic similarity score of .714, despite the fact
that the latter pair reflects a much more common plu-
ralization pattern.
Of course, this emancipation from edge-anchored
concatenation and global distributional salience also
implies that orthographic similarity will assign high
3Following a suggestion by two reviewers, we are currently
experimenting with an iterative version of our algorithm, along
the lines of the one described by Yarowsky and Wicentowski.
We start with the cost matrix described in the text, but we re-
estimate the editing costs on the basis of the empirical character-
to-character (or character-to-zero/zero-to-character) probabili-
ties observed in the output of the previous run of the algorithm.
Surprisingly, the revised version of the algorithm leads to (mod-
erately) worse results than the single-run version described in
this paper. Further experimentation with edit cost re-estimation
is needed, in order to understand which aspects of our iterative
procedure make it worse than the single-run model, and how it
could be improved.
scores to many pairs that are not morphologically
related ? for example, the pair friends/trends also has
an orthographic similarity score of .714.
Furthermore, since in most languages the range of
possible word lengths is narrow, orthographic simi-
larity as a ranking measure tends to suffer of a ?mas-
sive tying? problem. For example, when pairs from
the German corpus described below are ranked on
the sole basis of orthographic similarity, the result-
ing list is headed by a block of 19,597 pairs that all
have the same score. These are all pairs where one
word has 9 characters, the other 9 or 8 characters,
and the two differ in only one character.4
For the above reasons, it is crucial that ortho-
graphic similarity is combined with an independent
measure that allows us to distinguish between simi-
larity due to morphological relatedness vs. similar-
ity due to chance or other reasons.
3.3 Scoring the semantic similarity of word
pairs
Measuring the semantic similarity of words on the
basis of raw corpus data is obviously a much harder
task than measuring the orthographic similarity of
words.
Mutual information (first introduced to compu-
tational linguistics by Church and Hanks (1989)) is
one of many measures that seems to be roughly
correlated to the degree of semantic relatedness be-
tween words. The mutual information between two
words A and B is given by:
I(A,B) = log
Pr(A,B)
Pr(A)Pr(B)
(1)
Intuitively, the larger the deviation between the
empirical frequency of co-occurrence of two words
and the expected frequency of co-occurrence if they
were independent, the more likely it is that the oc-
currence of one of the two words is not independent
from the occurrence of the other.
Brown et ali (1990) observed that when mutual
information is computed in a bi-directional fashion,
and by counting co-occurrences of words within a
4Most of the pairs in this block ? 78% ? are actually morpho-
logically related. However, given that all pairs contain words
of length 9 and 8/9 that differ in one character only, they are
bound to reflect only a very small subset of the morphological
processes present in German.
relatively large window, but excluding ?close? co-
occurrences (which would tend to capture colloca-
tions and lexicalized phrases), the measure identifies
semantically related pairs.
It is particularly interesting for our purposes that
most of the examples of English word clusters con-
structed on the basis of this interpretation of mutual
information by Brown and colleagues (reported in
their table 6) include morphologically related words.
A similar pattern emerges among the examples of
German words clustered in a similar manner by
Baroni et ali (2002). Rosenfeld (1996) reports that
morphologically related pairs are common among
words with a high (average) mutual information.
We computed mutual information by considering,
for each pair, only co-occurrences within a maxi-
mal window of 500 words and outside a minimal
window of 3 words. Given that mutual informa-
tion is notoriously unreliable at low frequencies (see,
for example, Manning and Schu?tze (1999), section
5.4), we only collected mutual information scores
for pairs that co-occurred at least three times (within
the relevant window) in the input corpus. Obvi-
ously, occurrences across article boundaries were
not counted. Notice however that the version of the
Brown corpus we used does not mark article bound-
aries. Thus, in this case the whole corpus was treated
as a single article.
Our ?semantic? similarity measure is based on the
notion that related words will tend to often occur in
the nears of each other. This differs from the (more
general) approach of Schone and Jurafsky (2000),
who look for words that tend to occur in the same
context. It remains an open question whether the
two approaches produce complementary or redun-
dant results.5
Taken by itself, mutual information is a worse
predictor of morphological relatedness than mini-
mum edit distance. For example, among the top one
hundred pairs ranked by mutual information in each
language, only one German pair and five English
pairs are morphologically motivated. This poor per-
formance is not too surprising, given that there are
5We are currently experimenting with a measure based on
semantic context similarity (determined on the basis of class-
based left-to-right and right-to-left bigrams), but the current im-
plementation of this requires ad hoc corpus-specific settings to
produce interesting results with both our test corpora.
plenty of words that often co-occur together without
being morphologically related. Consider for exam-
ple (from our English list) the pairs index/operand
and orthodontist/teeth.
4 Empirical evaluation
4.1 Materials
We tested our procedure on the German APA corpus,
a corpus of newswire containing over twenty-eight
million word tokens, and on the English Brown cor-
pus (Kuc?era and Francis, 1967), a balanced corpus
containing less than one million two hundred thou-
sand word tokens. Of course, the most important dif-
ference between these two corpora is that they rep-
resent different languages. However, observe also
that they have very different sizes, and that they are
different in terms of the types of texts constituting
them.
Besides the high frequency trimming procedure
described above, for both languages we removed
from the potential content word lists those words
that were not recognized by the XEROX morpholog-
ical analyzer for the relevant language. The reason
for this is that, as we describe below, we use this tool
to build the reference sets for evaluation purposes.
Thus, morphologically related pairs composed of
words not recognized by the analyzer would unfairly
lower the precision of our algorithm.
Moreover, after some preliminary experimenta-
tion, we also decided to remove words longer than 9
characters from the German list (this corresponds to
trimming words whose length is one standard devi-
ation or more above the average token length). This
actually lowers the performance of our system, but
makes the results easier to analyze ? otherwise, the
top of the German list would be cluttered by a high
number of rather uninteresting morphological pairs
formed by inflected forms from the paradigm of
very long nominal compounds (such as Wirtschafts-
forschungsinstitut ?institute for economic research?).
Unlike high frequency trimming, the two opera-
tions we just described are meant to facilitate empir-
ical evaluation, and they do not constitute necessary
steps of the core algorithm.
4.2 Precision
In order to evaluate the precision obtained by our
procedure, we constructed a list of all the pairs that,
according to the analysis provided by the XEROX
analyzer for the relevant language, are morpholog-
ically related (i.e., share one of their stems).6 We
refer to the lists constructed in the way we just de-
scribed as reference sets.
The XEROX tools we used do not provide deriva-
tional analysis for English, and a limited form of
derivational analysis for German. Our algorithm,
however, finds both inflectionally and derivationally
related pairs. Thus, basing our evaluation on a com-
parison with the XEROX parses leads to an underes-
timation of the precision of the algorithm. We found
that this problem is particularly evident in English,
since English, unlike German, has a rather poor in-
flectional morphology, and thus the discrepancies
between our output and the analyzer parses in terms
of derivational morphology have a more visible im-
pact on the results of the comparison. For example,
the English analyzer does not treat pairs related by
the adverbial suffix -ly or by the prefix un- as mor-
phologically related, whereas our algorithm found
pairs such as soft/softly and load/unload.
In order to obtain a more fair assessment of the
algorithm, we went manually through the first 2,000
English pairs found by our algorithm but not parsed
as related by the analyzer, looking for items to be
added to the reference set. We were extremely
conservative, and we added to the reference set
only those pairs that are related by a transparent
and synchronically productive morphological pat-
tern. When in doubt, we did not correct the analyzer-
based analysis. Thus, for example, we did not count
pairs such as machine/machinery, variables/varies
or electric/electronic as related.
We did not perform any manual post-processing
on the German reference set.
Tables 1 and 2 report percentage precision (i.e.,
the percentage of pairs that are in the reference set
over the total number of ranked pairs up to the rele-
vant threshold) at various cutoff points, for German
and English respectively.
6The XEROX morphological analyzers are state-of-the-art,
knowledge-driven morphological analysis tools (see for exam-
ple Karttunen et ali (1997)).

Table 2: English precision at various cutoff points
(8902 = total number of pairs)
For both languages we notice a remarkably high
precision rate (> 90%) up to the 1500-pair cutoff
point.
After that, there is a sharper drop in the English
precision, whereas the decline in German is more
gradual. This is perhaps due in part to the problems
with the English reference set we discussed above,
but notice also that English has an overall poorer
morphological system and that the English corpus is
considerably smaller than the German one. Indeed,
our reference set for German contains more than ten
times the forms in the English reference set.
Notice anyway that, for both languages, the preci-
sion rate is still around 50% at the 5000-pair cutoff.7
7Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000) report an accuracy of
over 99% for their best model and a test set of 3888 pairs. Our
precision rate at a comparable cutoff point is much lower (58%
at the 4000-pair cutoff). However, Yarowksy and Wicentowski
restricted the possible matchings to pairs in which one member
is an inflected verb form, and the other member is a potential
verbal root, whereas in our experiments any word in the corpus
(as long as it was below a certain frequency threshold, and it was
recognized by the XEROX analyzer) could be matched with any
other word in the corpus. Thus, on the one hand, Yarowsky and
Wicentowski forced the algorithm to produce a matching for a
certain set of words (their set of inflected forms), whereas our
algorithm was not subject to an analogous constraint. On the
other hand, though, our algorithm had to explore a much larger
possible matching space, and it could (and did) make a high
number of mistakes on pairs (such as, e.g., sorry and worry) that
Of course, what counts as a ?good? precision rate
depends on what we want to do with the output of
our procedure. We show below that even a very
naive morphological rule extraction algorithm can
extract sensible rules by taking whole output lists as
its input, since, although the number of false pos-
itives is high, they are mostly related by patterns
that are not attested as frequently in the list as the
patterns relating true morphological pairs. In other
words, true morphological pairs tend to be related
by patterns that are distributionally more robust than
those displayed by false positives. Thus, rule ex-
tractors and other procedures processing the output
of our algorithm can probably tolerate a high false
positive rate if they take frequency and other distri-
butional properties of patterns into account.
Notice that we discussed only precision, and not
recall. This is because we believe that the goal of a
morphological discovery procedure is not to find the
exhaustive list of all morphologically related forms
in a language (indeed, because of morphological
productivity, such list is infinite), but rather to dis-
cover all the possible (synchronically active and/or
common) morphological processes present in a lan-
guage. It is much harder to measure how good our
algorithm performed in this respect, but the qualita-
tive analysis we present in the next subsection indi-
cates that, at least, the algorithm discovers a varied
and interesting set of morphological processes.
4.3 Morphological patterns discovered by the
algorithm
The precision tables confirm that the algorithm
found a good number of morphologically related
pairs. However, if it turned out that all of these
pairs were examples of the same morphological pat-
tern (say, nominal plural formation in -s), the al-
gorithm would not be of much use. Moreover, we
stated at the beginning that, since our algorithm does
not assume an edge-based stem+affix concatenation
model of morphology, it should be well suited to dis-
cover relations that cannot be characterized in these
Yarowksy and Wicentowski?s algorithm did not have to con-
sider. Schone and Jurafsky (2000) report a maximum precision
of 92%. It is hard to compare this with our results, since they
use a more sophisticated scoring method (based on paradigms
rather than pairs) and a different type of gold standard. More-
over, they do not specify what was the size of the input they
used for evaluation.
terms (e.g., pairs related by circumfixation, stem
changes, etc.). It is interesting to check whether the
algorithm was indeed able to find relations of this
sort.
Thus, we performed a qualitative analysis of the
output of the algorithm, trying to understand what
kind of morphological processes were captured by
it.
In order to look for morphological processes in
the algorithm output, we wrote a program that ex-
tracts ?correspondence rules? in the following sim-
ple way: For each pair, the program looks for the
longest shared (case-insensitive) left- and right-edge
substrings (i.e., for a stem + suffix parse and for a
prefix + stem parse). The program then chooses the
parse with the longest stem (assuming that one of the
two parses has a non-zero stem), and extracts the rel-
evant edge-bound correspondence rule. If there is a
tie, the stem + suffix parse is preferred. The program
then ranks the correspondence rules on the basis of
their frequency of occurrence in the original output
list.8
We want to stress that we are adopting this proce-
dure as a method to explore the results, and we are
by no means proposing it as a serious rule induction
algorithm. One of the most obvious drawbacks of
the current rule extraction procedure is that it is only
able to extract linear, concatenative, edge-bound suf-
fixation and prefixation patterns, and thus it misses
or fails to correctly generalize some of the most in-
teresting patterns in the output. Indeed, looking at
the patterns missed by the algorithm (as we do in
part below) is as instructive as looking at the rules it
found.
Tables 3 and 4 report the top five suffixation and
prefixation patterns found by the rule extractor by
taking the entire German and English output lists as
its input.
These tables show that our morphological pair
scoring procedure found many instances of various
common morphological patterns. With the excep-
tion of the German ?prefixation? rule ers?drit (ac-
tually relating the roots of the ordinals ?first? and
?second?), and of the compounding pattern  ? ?Ol
(?Oil?), all the rules in these lists correspond to re-
alistic affixation patterns. Not surprisingly, in both
8Ranking by cumulative score yields analogous results.

Table 4: The most common English suffixation and
prefixation patterns
languages many of the most frequent rules (such as,
e.g., ?s) are poly-functional, corresponding to a
number of different morphological relations within
and across categories.
The results reported in these tables confirm that
the algorithm is capturing common affixation pro-
cesses, but they are based on patterns that are so
frequent that even a very naive procedure could un-
cover them9
More interesting observations emerge from fur-
ther inspection of the ranked rule files. For exam-
ple, among the 70 most frequent German suffixation
rules extracted by the procedure, we encounter those
in table 5.10
The patterns in this table show that our algorithm
is capturing the non-concatenative plural formation
9For example, as shown by a reviewer, a procedure that pairs
words that share the same first five letters, and extracts the di-
verging substrings following the common prefix from each pair.
10In order to find the set of rules presented in table 5 using the
naive algorithm described in the previous footnote, we would
have to consider the 2672 most frequent rules. Most of these
2672 rules, of course, do not correspond to true morphological
patterns ? thus, the interesting rules would be buried in noise.

Table 5: Some German rules involving stem vowel
changes found by the rule extractor
process involving fronting of the stem vowel plus
addition of a suffix (-e/-en). A smarter rule extractor
should be able to generalize from patterns like these
to a smaller number of more general rules capturing
the discontinuous change. Other umlaut-based pat-
terns that do not involve concomitant suffixation ?
such as in Mutter/Mu?tter ? were also found by our
core algorithm, but they were wrongly parsed as in-
volving prefixes (e.g., Mu?Mu?) by the rule extrac-
tor.
Finally, it is very interesting to look at those pairs
that are morphologically related according to the
XEROX analyzer, and that were discovered by our
algorithm, but where the rule extractor could not
posit a rule, since they do not share a substring at
either edge. These are listed, for German, in table 6.

Table 6: Morphologically related German pairs that
do not share an edge found by the basic algorithm
We notice in this table, besides three further in-
stances of non-affixal morphology, a majority of
pairs involving circumfixation of one of the mem-
bers.
While a more in-depth qualitative analysis of our
results should be conducted, the examples we dis-
cussed here confirm that our algorithm is able to cap-
ture a number of different morphological patterns,
including some that do not fit into a strictly concate-
native edge-bound stem+affix model.
5 Conclusion and Future Directions
We presented an algorithm that, by taking a raw cor-
pus as its input, produces a ranked list of morpho-
logically related pairs at its output. The algorithm
finds morphologically related pairs by looking at the
degree of orthographic similarity (measured by min-
imum edit distance) and semantic similarity (mea-
sured by mutual information) between words from
the input corpus.
Experiments with German and English inputs
gave encouraging results, both in terms of precision,
and in terms of the nature of the morphological pat-
terns found within the output set.
In work in progress, we are exploring various pos-
sible improvements to our basic algorithm, includ-
ing iterative re-estimation of edit costs, addition of a
context-similarity-based measure, and extension of
the output set by morphological transitivity, i.e. the
idea that if word a is related to word b, and word b
is related to word c, then word a and word c should
also form a morphological pair.
Moreover, we plan to explore ways to relax the re-
quirement that all pairs must have a certain degree of
semantic similarity to be treated as morphologically
related (there is evidence that humans treat certain
kinds of semantically opaque forms as morpholog-
ically complex ? see Baroni (2000) and the refer-
ences quoted there). This will probably involve tak-
ing distributional properties of word substrings into
account.
From the point of view of the evaluation
of the algorithm, we should design an as-
sessment scheme that would make our exper-
imental results more directly comparable to
those of Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000),
Schone and Jurafsky (2000) and others. Moreover,
a more in depth qualitative analysis of the results
should concentrate on identifying specific classes of
morphological processes that our algorithm can or
cannot identify correctly.
We envisage a number of possible uses for the
ranked list that constitutes the output of our model.
First, the model could provide the input for a
more sophisticated rule extractor, along the lines of
those proposed by Albright and Hayes (1999) and
Neuvel (2002). Such models extract morphologi-
cal generalizations in terms of correspondence pat-
terns between whole words, rather than in terms of
affixation rules, and are thus well suited to iden-
tify patterns involving non-concatenative morphol-
ogy and/or morphophonological changes. A list
of related words constitutes a more suitable input
for them than a list of words segmented into mor-
phemes.
Rules extracted in this way would have a number
of practical uses ? for example, they could be used
to construct stemmers for information retrieval ap-
plications, or they could be integrated into morpho-
logical analyzers.
Our procedure could also be used to re-
place the first step of algorithms, such as those
of Goldsmith (2001) and Snover and Brent (2001),
where heuristic methods are employed to generate
morphological hypotheses, and then an information-
theoretically/probabilistically motivated measure is
used to evaluate or improve such hypotheses. More
in general, our algorithm can help reduce the size
of the search space that all morphological discovery
procedures must explore.
Last but not least, the ranked output of (an im-
proved version of) our algorithm can be of use to
the linguist analyzing the morphology of a language,
who can treat it as a way to pre-process her/his
data, while still relying on her/his analytical skills
to extract the relevant morphological generalizations
from the ranked pairs.
