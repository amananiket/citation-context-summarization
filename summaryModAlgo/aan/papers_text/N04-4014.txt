Abstract 
In this paper we describe the analytic question 
answering system HITIQA (High-Quality In-
teractive Question Answering) which has been 
developed over the last 2 years as an advanced 
research tool for information analysts. 
HITIQA is an interactive open-domain ques-
tion answering technology designed to allow 
analysts to pose complex exploratory ques-
tions in natural language and obtain relevant 
information units to prepare their briefing re-
ports. The system uses novel data-driven se-
mantics to conduct a clarification dialogue 
with the user that explores the scope and the 
context of the desired answer space. The sys-
tem has undergone extensive hands-on evalua-
tions by a group of intelligence analysts repre-
senting various foreign intelligence services.  
This evaluation validated the overall approach 
in HITIQA but also exposed limitations of the 
current prototype.  
1   Introduction 
Our objective in HITIQA is to allow the user to submit 
exploratory, analytical questions, such as ?What has 
been Russia?s reaction to U.S. bombing of Kosovo?? 
The distinguishing property of such questions is that one 
cannot generally anticipate what might constitute the 
answer. While certain types of things may be expected 
(e.g., diplomatic statements), the answer is heavily con-
ditioned by what information is in fact available on the 
topic. From a practical viewpoint, analytical questions 
are often underspecified, thus casting a broad net on a 
space of possible answers. Questions posed by profes-
sional analysts are aimed to probe the available data 
along certain dimensions. The results of these probes 
determine follow up questions, if necessary. Further-
more, at any stage clarifications may be needed to adjust 
the scope and intent of each question. Figure 1a shows a 
fragment of an analytical session with HITIQA; please 
note that these questions are not aimed at factoids, de-
spite appearances.  HITIQA project is part of the ARDA 
AQUAINT program that aims to make significant ad-
vances in state of the art of automated question answer-
ing.

2   Factoid vs. Analytical QA 
The process of automated question answering is now 
fairly well understood for most types of factoid ques-
tions. Factoid questions display a fairly distinctive ?an-
swer type?, which is the type of the information item 
needed for the answer, e.g., ?person? or ?country?, etc. 
Most existing factoid QA systems deduct this expected 
answer type from the form of the question using a finite 
list of possible answer types. For example, ?How long 
was the Titanic?? expects some length measure as an 
answer, probably in yards and feet, or meters. This is 
generally a very good strategy that has been exploited 
successfully in a number of automated QA systems that 
appeared in recent years, especially in the context of 
TREC QA1  evaluations (Harabagiu et al, 2002; Hovy 
et al, 2000; Prager at al., 2001).     
This answer-typing process is not easily applied to 
analytical questions because the type of an answer for 
analytical questions cannot always be anticipated due to 
their inherently exploratory character.  In contrast to a 
factoid question, an analytical question has an unlimited 
variety of syntactic forms with only a loose connection 
between their syntax and the expected answer.  Given 
the unlimited potential of the formation of analytical 
questions, it would be counter-productive to restrict 
them to a limited number of question/answer types.  
Therefore, the formation of an answer in analytical QA 
should instead be guided by the user?s interest as ex-
pressed in the question, as well as through an interactive 
dialogue with the system.  
In this paper we argue that the semantics of an ana-
lytical question is more likely to be deduced from the

 information that is considered relevant to the question 
than through a detailed analysis of its particular form. 
Determining ?relevant? information is not the same as 
finding an answer; indeed we can use relatively simple 
information retrieval methods (keyword matching, etc.) 
to obtain perhaps 200 ?relevant? documents from a da-
tabase. This gives us an initial answer space to work 
from in order to determine the scope and complexity of 
the answer, but we are nowhere near the answer yet. In 
our project, we use structured templates, which we call 
frames, to map out the content of pre-retrieved docu-
ments, and subsequently to delineate the possible mean-
ing of the question before we can attempt to formulate 
an answer. 
3   Text Framing 
In HITIQA we use a text framing technique to delineate 
the gap between the meaning of the user?s question and 
the system?s ?understanding? of this question. The 
framing process does not attempt to capture the entire 
meaning of the passages; instead it imposes a partial 
structure on the text passages that would allow the sys-
tem to systematically compare different passages 
against each other and against the question.  Framing is 
just sufficient enough to communicate with the user 
about the differences in their question and the returned 
text. In particular, the framing process may uncover 
topics or aspects within the answer space which the user 
has not explicitly asked for, and thus may be unaware of 
their existence. If these topics or aspects align closely 
with the user?s question, we may want to make the user 
aware of them and let him/her decide if they should be 
included in the answer.   
Frames are built from the retrieved data, after clus-
tering it into several topical groups. Retrieved docu-
ments are first broken down into passages, mostly ex-
ploiting the naturally occurring paragraph structure of 
the original sources, filtering out duplicates.  The re-
maining passages are clustered using a combination of 
hierarchical clustering and n-bin classification (Hardy et 
al., 2002).  Typically three to six clusters are generated.  
Each cluster represents a topic theme within the re-
trieved set: usually an alternative or complimentary in-
terpretation of the user?s question. Since clusters are 
built out of small text passages, we associate a frame 
with each passage that serves as a seed of a cluster. We 
subsequently merge passages, and their associated 
frames whenever anaphoric and other cohesive links are 
detected.   
HITIQA starts by building a general frame on the 
seed passages of the clusters and any of the top N (cur-
rently N=10) scored passages that are not already in a 
cluster. The general frame represents an event or a rela-
tion involving any number of entities, which make up 
the frame?s attributes, such as LOCATION, PERSON, 
COUNTRY, ORGANIZATION, etc. Attributes are extracted 
from text passages by BBN?s Identifinder, which tags 
24 types of named entities. The event/relation itself 
could be pretty much anything, e.g., accident, pollution, 
trade, etc. and it is captured into the TOPIC attribute 
from the central verb or noun phrase of the passage. In 
general frames, attributes have no assigned roles; they 
are loosely grouped around the TOPIC.  
We have also defined three slightly more specialized 
typed frames by assigning roles to selected attributes in 
the general frame. These three ?specialized? frames are: 
(1) a Transfer frame with three roles including FROM, TO 
and OBJECT; (2) a two-role Relation frame with AGENT 
and OBJECT roles; and (3) a one-role Property frame. 
These typed frames represent certain generic 
events/relationships, which then map into more specific 
event types in each domain. Other frame types may be 
defined if needed, but we do not anticipate there will be 
more than a handful all together.2 Where the general 
frame is little more than just a ?bag of attributes?, the 
typed frames capture some internal structure of an 
event, but only to the extent required to enable an effi-
cient dialogue with the user. Typed frames are ?trig-
gered? by appearance of specific words in text, for ex-
ample the word export may trigger a Transfer frame. A 
single text passage may invoke one or more typed 
frames, or none at all. When no typed frame is invoked, 
the general frame is used as default. If a typed frame is 
invoked, HITIQA will attempt to identify the roles, e.g. 
FROM, TO, OBJECT, etc. This is done by mapping general 
frame attributes selected from text onto the typed attrib-
utes in the frames. In any given domain, e.g., weapon 
non-proliferation, both the trigger words and the role 
identification rules can be specialized from a training 
corpus of typical documents and questions. For exam-
ple, the role-ID rules rely both on syntactic cues and the 
expected entity types, which are domain adaptable.  
Domain adaptation is desirable for obtaining more 
focused dialogue, but it is not necessary for HITIQA to 
work. We used both setups under different conditions: 
the generic frames were used with TREC document 
collection to measure impact of IR precision on QA 
accuracy (Small et al, 2004). The domain-adapted 
frames were used for sessions with intelligence analysts 
working with the WMD Domain (see below). Currently, 
the adaptation process includes manual tuning followed 
by corpus bootstrapping using an unsupervised learning 
method (Strzalkowski & Wang, 1996). We generally 
rely on BBN?s Identifinder for extraction of basic enti-
ties, and use bootstrapping to define additional entity 
types as well as to assign roles to attributes. 
The version of HITIQA reported here and used by 
analysts during the evaluation has been adapted to the 
                                                 
2 Scalability is certainly an outstanding issue here, and we are work-
ing on effective frame acquisition methods, which is outside of the 
scope of this paper. 
 Weapons of Mass Destruction Non-Proliferation do-
main (WMD domain, henceforth).  Figure 1b contains 
an example passage from this data set. In the WMD 
domain, the typed frames were mapped onto 
WMDTransfer 3-role frame, and two 2-role frames 
WMDTreaty  and WMDDevelop. Adapting the frames to 
WMD domain required only minimal modification, 
such as adding WEAPON entity to augment Identifinder 
entity set, specializing OBJECT attribute in WMDTrans-
fer to WEAPON, generating a list of international weapon 
control treaties, etc. 
HITIQA frames define top-down constraints on how 
to interpret a given text passage, which is quite different 
from MUC3 template filling task (Humphreys et al, 
1998). What we?re trying to do here is to ?fit? a frame 
over a text passage. This means also that multiple 
frames can be associated with a text passage, or to be 
exact, with a cluster of passages. Since most of the pas-
sages that undergo the framing process are part of some 
cluster of very similar passages, the added redundancy 
helps to reinforce the most salient features for extrac-
tion. This makes the framing process potentially less 
error-prone than MUC-style template filling4.  
The Bush Administration claimed that Iraq was within one 
year of producing a nuclear bomb. On 30 November 1990... 
Leonard Spector said that Iraq possesses 200 tons of natural 
uranium imported and smuggled from several countries. Iraq 
possesses a few working centrifuges and the blueprints to 
build them. Iraq imported centrifuge materials from Nukem of 
the FRG and from other sources. One decade ago, Iraq im-
ported 27 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from France, ... 
FIGURE 1b: A text passage from the WMD domain data    
A very similar framing process is applied to the 
user?s question, resulting in one or more Goal frames, 
which are subsequently compared to the data frames 
obtained from retrieved text passages. A Goal frame can 
be a general frame or any of the typed frames. The Goal 
frame generated from the question, ?Has Iraq been able 
to import uranium?? is shown in Figure 2. This frame is 
of WMDTransfer type, with 3 role attributes TRF_TO, 
TRF_FROM and TRF_OBJECT, plus the relation type 
(TRF_TYPE). Each role attribute is defined over an un-
derlying general frame attribute (given in parentheses), 
which is used to compare frames of different types.  
HITIQA automatically judges a particular data 
frame as relevant, and subsequently the corresponding 
segment of text as relevant, by comparison to the Goal 
frame. The data frames are scored based on the number 
of conflicts found with the Goal frame. The conflicts are 
mismatches on values of corresponding attributes. If a

time.

highest relevance rank, and a conflict score of zero.

FIGURE 3: A frame obtained from the text passage in 
Figure 1b, in response to the Iraq question 
All other data frames are scored with an increasing 
value based on the number of conflicts, score 1 for 
frames with one conflict with the Goal frame, score 2 
for two conflicts etc. Frames that conflict with all in-
formation found in the query are given the score 99 in-
dicating the lowest rank. Currently, frames with a con-
flict score 99 are excluded from further processing as 
outliers. The frame in Figure 3 is scored as relevant to 
the user?s query and included in the answer space. 
4   Clarification Dialogue 
Data frames with a conflict score of zero form the 
initial kernel answer space and HITIQA proceeds by 
generating an answer from this space. Depending upon 
the presence of other frames outside of this set, the sys-
tem may initiate a dialogue with the user. HITIQA be-
gins asking the user questions on these near-miss frame 
groups, groups with one or more conflicts, with the 
largest group first. In order to keep the dialogue from 
getting too winded, we set thresholds on number of con-
flicts and group size that are considered by the dialogue 
manager.  
A 1-conflict frame has only a single attribute mis-
match with the Goal frame. This could be a mismatch 
on any of the general frame attributes, for example, LO-
CATION, ORGANIZATION, TIME, etc., or in one of the 
role-assigned attributes, TO, FROM, OBJECT, etc.  A spe-
cial case arises when the conflict occurs on the TOPIC 
attribute, which indicates the event type.  Since all other 
attributes match, we may be looking at potentially dif-
ferent events of the same kind involving the same enti-
ties, possibly occurring at the same location or time. 
The purpose of the clarification dialogue in this case is 
to probe which of these topics may be of interest to the 
user. Another special case arises when the Goal frame is 
of a different type than a data frame.  The purpose of the 
clarification dialogue in this case is to see if the user 
wishes to expand the answer space to include events of 
a different type. This situation is illustrated in the ex-
 change shown in Figure 4. Note that the user can exam-
ine a partial answer prior to answering clarification 
questions.   
User: ?Has Iraq been able to import uranium?? 
[a partial answer displayed in an answer window] 
HITIQA: ?Are you also interested in background information 
on the uranium development program in Iraq?? 
FIGURE 4:  Clarification question generated for the 
Iraq/uranium question 
The clarification question in Figure 4 is generated by 
comparing the Goal frame in Figure 2 to a partly match-
ing frame (Figure 5) generated from some other text 
passage. We note first that the Goal frame for this ex-
ample is of WMDTransfer type, while the data frame in 
Figure 5 is of the type WMDDevelop. Nonetheless, both 
frames match on their general-frame attributes WEAPON 
and LOCATION. Therefore, HITIQA asks the user if it 
should expand the answer space to include development 
of uranium in Iraq as well. 
During the dialogue, as new information is obtained 
from the user, the Goal frame is updated and the scores 
of all the data frames are reevaluated.  If the user re-
sponds the equivalent of ?yes? to the system clarifica-
tion question in the dialogue in Figure 4, a correspond-
ing WMDDevelop frame will be added to the set of ac-
tive Goal frames and all WMDDevelop frames obtained 
from text passages will be re-scored for possible inclu-
sion in the answer.  
FRAME TYPE: WMDDevelop    
DEV_TYPE (TOPIC): development, produced 
DEV_OBJECT (WEAPON): nuclear weapons, uranium 
DEV_AGENT (LOCATION): Iraq, Tuwaitha 
CONFLICT SCORE: 2 
Conflicts with FRAME_TYPE and TOPIC  
FIGURE 5: A 2-conflict frame against the Iraq/uranium ques-
tion that generated the dialogue in Figure 4. 
The user may end the dialogue at any point using the 
generated answer given the current state of the frames. 
Currently, the answer is simply composed of text pas-
sages from the zero conflict frames. In addition, 
HITIQA will generate a ?headline? for the text passages 
in the answer space.  This is done using a combination 
of text templates and simple grammar rules applied to 
the attributes of the passage frame.   
5   HITIQA Qualitative Evaluations 
In order to assess our progress thus far, and to also 
develop metrics to guide future evaluation, we invited a 
group of analysts employed by the US government to 
participate in two three-day workshops, held in Septem-
ber and October 2003.  
The two basic objectives of the workshops were: 
1. To perform a realistic assessment of the useful-
ness and usability of HITIQA as an end-to-end system, 
from the information seeker's initial questions to com-
pletion of a draft report.  
2. To develop metrics to compare the answers ob-
tained by different analysts and evaluate the quality of 
the support that HITIQA provides.     
The analysts' primary task was preparation of reports 
in response to scenarios - complex questions that usu-
ally encompassed multiple sub-questions. The scenarios 
were developed in conjunction with several U.S. gov-
ernment offices. These scenarios, detailing information 
required for the final report, were not normally used 
directly as questions to HITIQA, instead, they were 
treated as a basis to issues possibly leading to a series of 
questions, as shown in Figure 1a. 
The results of these evaluations strongly validated 
our approach to analytical QA. At the same time, we 
learned a great deal about how analysts work, and about 
how to improve the interface.  
Analysts completed several questionnaires de-
signed to assess their overall experience with the sys-
tem.  Many of the questions required the analysts to 
compare HITIQA to other tools they were currently 
using in their work. HITIQA scores were quite high, 
with mean score 3.73 out of 5.  We scored particularly 
high in comparison to current analytic tools. We have 
also asked the analysts to cross-evaluate their product 
reports obtained from interacting with HITIQA. Again, 
the results were quite good with a mean answer quality 
score of 3.92 out of 5. While this evaluation was only 
preliminary, it nonetheless gave us confidence that our 
design is ?correct? in a broad sense.5
