Abstract
Vocal activity detection is an impor-
tant technology for both automatic speech
recognition and automatic speech under-
standing. In meetings, standard vocal
activity detection algorithms have been
shown to be ineffective, because partici-
pants typically vocalize for only a frac-
tion of the recorded time and because,
while they are not vocalizing, their channels
are frequently dominated by crosstalk from
other participants. In the present work,
we review a particular type of normaliza-
tion of maximum cross-channel correlation,
a feature recently introduced to address the
crosstalk problem. We derive a plausible
geometric interpretation and show how the
frame size affects performance.
1 Introduction
Vocal activity detection (VAD) is an important tech-
nology for any application with an automatic speech
recognition (ASR) front end. In meetings, partic-
ipants typically vocalize for only a fraction of the
recorded time. Their temporally contiguous contri-
butions should be identified prior to ASR in order to
leverage speaker adaptation schemes and language
model constraints, and to associate recognized out-
put with specific speakers (who said what). Segmen-
tation into such contributions is informed primarily
by VAD on a frame-by-frame basis.
Individual head-mounted microphone (IHM)
recordings of meetings present a particular challenge
for VAD, due to crosstalk from other participants.
Most state-of-the-art VAD systems for meetings rely
on decoding in a binary speech/non-speech space,
assuming independence among participants, but are
increasingly relying on features specifically designed
to address the crosstalk issue (Wrigley et al, 2005).
A feature which has attracted attention since its
use in VAD post-processing in (Pfau et al, 2001)
is the maximum cross-channel correlation (XC),
max? ?jk (?), between channels j and k, where ? is
the lag. When designing features descriptive of the
kth channel, XC is frequently normalized by the en-
ergy in the target1 channel k (Wrigley et al, 2003).
Alternately, XC can be normalized by the energy in
the non-target channel j (Laskowski et al, 2004),
a normalization which we refer to here as NT-Norm,
extending the Norm and S-Norm naming conventions
in (Wrigley et al, 2005). Table 1 shows several types
of normalizations which have been explored.

In [1], a median-smoothed version was used in post-
processing. In [3], the sum (JMXC) was used in-
stead of the mean. In [5], cross-correlation was com-
puted over samples and features. In [6], the mini-
mum and the maximum were jointly referred to as
NMXC. References in bold depict features selected

The present work revisits NT-Norm normalization,
which has been successfully used in a threshold de-
tector (Laskowski et al, 2004), in automatic initial
label assignment (Laskowski and Schultz, 2006), and
as part of a two-state decoder feature vector (Boakye
and Stolcke, 2006). Our main contribution is a geo-
metric interpretation of NT-Norm XC, in Section 2.
We also describe, in Section 3, several contrastive
experiments, and discuss the results in Section 4.
2 Geometric Interpretation
We propose an interpretable geometric approxima-
tion to NT-Norm XC for channel k,
?k,j =
max? ?jk (?)
?jj
, ?j 6=k (1)
We assume the simplified response in the kth IHM
microphone at a distance dk from a single point
source s (t) to be
mk (t) .= Ak
( 1
dk
s
(
t? dkc
)
+ ?k (t)
)
, (2)
where c, Ak and ?k (t) are the speed of sound, the
gain of microphone k, and source-uncorrelated noise
at microphone k, respectively. Cross-channel corre-
lation is approximated over a frame of size ? by
?jk (?) =
?
?
AjAk
djdk
s (t) s (t? ?) dt , (3)
where ? ? (dj ? dk) /c. Letting Ps ?
?
? s2 (t) dt and
P?k ?
?
? ?2k (t) dt,
?jj (0) = A2j
(

respectively, as the maximum of ?jk (?) occurs at
?? = (dk ? dj) /c. In consequence,
max? ?jk (?)
?jj (0)
? djdk
, (6)
provided that
Ak

?
? ? 1 , (7)
i.e., under assumptions of similar microphone gains,
a non-negligible farfield signal-to-noise ratio at each
microphone, and the simplifications embodied in
Equation 2, NT-Norm XC approximates the relative
distances of 2 microphones to the single point source
s (t). We stress that this approximation requires no
side knowledge about the true positions of the par-
ticipants or of their microphones.
Importantly, this interpretation is valid only if ??
lies within the integration window ? in Equation 3.
In (Boakye and Stolcke, 2006), the authors showed
that when the analysis window is 25 ms, the NMXC
feature is not as robust as frame-level energy flooring
followed by cross-channel normalization (NLED).
3 Experimental Setup
3.1 VAD and ASR Systems
Our multispeaker VAD system, shown in Figure 1,
was introduced in (Laskowski and Schultz, 2006).
Rather than detecting the 2-state speech (V) vs.
non-speech (N ) activity of each partipant indepen-
dently, the system implements a Viterbi search for
the best path through a 2K-state vocal interac-
tion space, where K is the number of participants.
Segmentation consists of three passes: initial la-
bel assignment (ILA), described in the next subsec-
tion, for acoustic model training; simultaneous multi-
participant Viterbi decoding; and smoothing to pro-
duce segments for ASR. In the current work, during
decoding, we limit the maximum number of simulta-
neously vocalizing participants to 3.
This system is an improved version of that fielded
in the NIST Rich Transcription 2006 Meeting Recog-
nition evaluation (RT06s)2, to produce automatic
segmentation in the IHM condition on conference
meetings. The ASR system which we use in this
paper is as described in (Fu?gen et al, 2007).
3.2 Unsupervised ILA
For unsupervised labeling of the test audio, prior to
acoustic model training, we employ the criterion
q? [k] =
?
?
?
V if
?
j 6=k
log
(
max? ?jk(?)
?jj(0)
)
> 0
N otherwise .

Assuming equality in Equation 6, this corresponds
to declaring a participant as vocalizing when the dis-
tance between the location of the dominant sound
source and that participant?s microphone is smaller
than the geometric mean of the distances from the
source to the remaining microphones, ie. when

We refer to this algorithm as ILAave. For contrast we
also consider ILAmin, with the sum in Equation 8 re-
placed by the minimum over j 6=k. This corresponds
to declaring a participant as vocalizing when the dis-
tance between the location of the dominant sound
source and that participant?s microphone is smaller
than the distance from the source to any other mi-
crophone. We do not consider ILAmax, whose inter-
pretation in light of Equation 6 is not useful.
3.3 Data
The data used in the described experiments con-
sist of two datasets from the NIST RT-05s and
RT-06s evaluations. The data which had been
used for VAD system improvement, rt05s eval*,
is the complete rt05s eval set less one meeting,
NIST 20050412-1303. This meeting was excluded
as it contains a participant without a microphone, a
condition known a priori to be absent in rt06s eval;
we use the latter in its entirety.
3.4 Description of Experiments
The experiments we present aim to compare ILAave
and ILAmin, and to show how the size of the inte-
gration window, ?, affects system performance. As
our VAD decoder operates at a frame size of 100ms,
we introduce a reframing step between the ILA com-
ponent and both AM training and decoding; see Fig-
ure 1. V is assigned to each 100ms frame if 50% or
more of the frame duration is assigned V by ILA;
otherwise, the 100ms frame is assigned an N label.
We measure performance in four locations within
the combined VAD+ASR system architecture, also
shown in Figure 1. We compute a VAD frame er-
ror just after reframing (q?F ), just after decoding
(q?), and just after smoothing (? (q?)). This er-
ror is the sum of the miss rate (MS), and the false
alarm rate excluding intervals of all-participant si-
lence (FAX), computed against unsmoothed word-
level forced alignment references. We use this met-
ric for comparative purposes only, across the vari-
ous measurement points. We also use first-pass ASR
word error rates (WERs), after lattice rescoring, as
a final measure of performance impact.
We evaluate, over a range of ILA frame sizes, the
performance of ILAave(3), with a maximum number
of simultaneously vocalizing participants of 3, and
for the contrastive ILAmin. We note that ILAmin
is capable of declaring at most one microphone at a
time as being worn by a current speaker. As a re-
sult, construction of acoustic models for overlapped
vocal activity states, described in (Laskowski and
Schultz, 2006), results in states of at most 2 simul-
taneously vocalizing participants. We therefore refer
to ILAmin as ILAmin(2), and additionally consider
ILAave(2), in which states with 3 simultaneously vo-
calizing participants are removed.
4 Results and Discussion
We show the results of our experiments in Ta-
ble 2. First-pass WERs, using reference segmenta-
tion (.stm), vary by 1.3% absolute (abs) between
rt05s eval and rt06s eval. We also note that re-
moving the one meeting with a participant without
a microphone reduces the rt05s eval manual seg-
mentation WER by 1.7% abs. WERs obtained with
automatic segmentation should be compared to the
manual segmentation WERs for each set.
As the q?F columns shows, ILAmin(2) entails sig-
nificantly more VAD errors than ILAave. Notably,
although we do not show the breakdown, ILAmin(2)
is characterized by fewer false alarms, but misses
much more speech than ILAave(2). This is due in
part to its inability to identify simultaneous talk-
ers. However, following acoustic model training and
use (q?), the VAD error rates between the two algo-
rithms are approximately equal.
In studying the WERs for each ILA algorithm in-
dependently, the variation across ILA frame sizes in
the range 25?100 ms can be significant: for example,
it is 1.2% abs for ILAmin(2) on rt06s eval, com-
pared to the difference with manual segmentation of
3.1% abs. Error curves, as a function of ILA frame
size, are predominantly shallow parabolas, except at
75 ms (notably for ILAmin(2) at q?F ); we believe that

Table 2: VAD errors, measured at three points in our
system, and first-pass WERs for rt05s eval (05),
as well as first-pass WERs for rt05s eval* (05*)
and rt06s eval (06). Results are shown for 3 con-
trastive VAD systems (ILAave(3), ILAave(2) and
ILAmin(2)), and 4 ILA frame sizes (100ms, 75ms,
50ms, and 25ms).
this is because 75 ms does not divide evenly into the
decoder frame size of 100 ms, causing more deletions
across the reframing step than for other ILA frame
sizes. Error minima appear for an ILA frame size
somewhere between 50 ms and 75 ms, for both ASR
and post-decoding VAD errors.
Although (Pfau et al, 2001) considered a maxi-
mum lag of 250 samples (15.6ms, or 5m at the speed
of sound), their computation of S-Norm XC used
a rectangular window. Here, as in (Laskowski and
Schultz, 2006) and (Boakye and Stolcke, 2006), we
use a Hamming window. Our results suggest that a
large, broadly tapered window is important for Equa-
tion 6 to hold.
The table also shows that for datasets with-
out uninstrumented participants, rt05s eval*
and rt06s eval, ILAmin(2) is outperformed by
ILAave(2) by as much as 1.1% abs in WER, espe-
cially at small frame sizes. The difference for the full
rt05s eval dataset is smaller. The results also sug-
gest that reducing the maximum degree of simulta-
neous vocalization from 3 to 2 during decoding is an
effective means of reducing errors (ASR insertions,
not shown) for uninstrumented participants.
5 Conclusions
We have derived a geometric approximation for a
particular type of normalization of maximum cross-
channel correlation, NT-Norm XC, recently intro-
duced for multispeaker vocal activity detection. Our
derivation suggests that it is effectively comparing
the distance between each speaker?s mouth and each
microphone. This is novel, as geometry is most often
inferred using the lag of the crosscorrelation maxi-
mum, rather than its amplitude.
Our experiments suggest that frame sizes of 50?75
ms lead to WERs which are lower than those for ei-
ther 100 ms or 25 ms by as much as 1.2% abs; that
ILAave outperforms ILAmin as an initial label as-
signment criterion; and that reducing the degree of
simultaneous vocalization during decoding may ad-
dress problems due to uninstrumented participants.
