ABSTRACT 
The paper presents and compares two different 
methods of parsing, a regular expression method 
and a stochastic method, with respect o their 
success in identifying basic clauses in 
unrestricted English text. These methods of 
parsing were developed in order to be applied to 
the task of improving the detection of large 
prosodic units in the Bell Labs text-to-speech 
system, and were so applied experimentally. 
The paper also discusses the notion of basic 
clause that was defined as the parsing target. 
The result of a comparison of the error rates of 
the two parsing methods in the recognition of 
basic clauses showed that there was a 13% error 
rate for the regular expression method and a 
6.5% error rate for the stochastic method. 
1. Introduction 
The present paper describes the procedure that 
was followed in an extended experiment o 
reliably find basic surface clauses in unrestricted 
English text, using various combinations of 
finitary and stochastic methods. The purpose was 
to make some improvements in the detection and 
treatment of large prosodic units above the level 
of fgroups in the Bell Labs text-to-speech 
system. This system currently relies exclusively 
on punctuation (commas and periods) for the 
detection of such units, i.e. tonal minor and 
major phrases. Commas are correlated with 
tonal minor phrases, and sentence final periods 
with tonal major phrases. The notion of fgroup 
(one or more function words followed by one or 
more content words), and its implementation i  
the Bell Labs text-to-speech system is described 
in Liberman & Buchsbaum (1985). 
Correct automatic detection of major syntactic 
boundaries, in particular clause boundaries, is a 
prerequisite for automatic insertion of final 
lengthening, boundary tones and pauses at such 
boundaries within sentences (cf. Allen, Hunnicutt 
& Klatt 1987,and Altenberg 1987). These 
prosodic phenomena make significant 
contribution to the naturalness and intelligibility 
of synthetic speech. Unfortunately, the task of 
parsing unrestricted text correctly, in order to 
find the relevant sentence internal syntactic 
boundaries has turned out to be very difficult. 
This paper is a report of an attempt to provide a 
better foundation for parsing text by the use of 
simple fmitary and stochastic computational 
methods. These simple methods have not 
figured prominently in the theory and practice of 
natural langauge parsing, with some exceptions 
(Langendoen 1975, Church 1982, Ejerhed & 
Church 1983). For an experimental, and more 
complicated method to derive all prosodic units 
in the text-to-speech system, i.e. not just tonal 
minor and major phrases but every type of 
prosodic unit, from the syntactic structure and 
length of constituents, ee Wright, Bachenko & 
Fitzpatrick (1986). 
The first purpose of the experiment was to test 
the performance of a finite state parser, when the 
parser was given the rather difficult and 
substantive tasks of finding basic, non-recursive 
clauses in continuous text, in which each word 
had been tagged with a part of speech label. 
Parts of the tagged Brown corpus were used, 
representing the genres of both informative and 
imaginative prose. The clause grammar, 
consisting of a regular expression for clauses of 
different kinds, was constructed by the author .-. 
and tt was first applied to text that was 
guaranteed to have correct parts of speech 
assigned to the words, so that problems in 
constructing the grammar could be isolated from 
problems in assigning correct parts of speech. 
The finite state parser that used the clause 
grammar consisted of a program that matched 
regular expressions for clauses against the 
longest substrings of tagged words that fit them, 
and it was constructed and implemented by K. 
Church. 
The second purpose was to see whether basic 
clauses could also be recognized by stochastic 
programs, after these had been trained on 
suitable training material. The training material 
was prepared by hand-correcting the output of 
the program that processed the regular 
210 
expressions for clauses. A stochastic program for 
assigning unique part of speech tags to words in 
unrestricted text had been created by K. Church, 
and trained on the tagged Brown corpus (see 
Church 1987). The resultant program is 95-99% 
correct in its performance, depending on the 
criteria of correctness used, and it can be used as 
a lexical front end to any kind of parser, i.e. not 
necessarily stochastic or finite state parsers. 
However, the question presented itself whether 
the stochastic procedure that was so successful in 
recognizing parts of speech could also be applied 
to more advanced tasks such as recognizing noun 
phrases and clauses. The present paper 
concentrates on the parsing of basic clauses. The 
parsing of noun phrases by the same two 
methods is compared in Ejerhed (1987), and the 
stochastic parsing of noun phrases is described in 
detail in Church (1987). 
The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 
2 defines the target of a basic clause, and reports 
on the outcome of the search for such milts by 
the two methods. Section 3 discusses the 
correlations between clause units as defined by 
this paper, and the prosodic units of tonal minor 
and major phrases in the Bell Labs text-to- 
speech system. 
2. Finding Clauses 
2.1 Why Clauses? 
Syntactic surface clauses are interesting units of 
language processing for a variety of reasons. In 
the surface clause, criteria of form and meaning 
converge to guarantee both that it can be 
recognized solely by surface syntactic properties 
and that it constitutes a meaningful unit (ideally 
a proposition) in a semantic representation. 
Clauses have been investigated in 
psycholinguistic research. Jarvella (1971) found 
effects of both sentence boundaries and clause 
boundaries in recall of spoken complex sentences 
and took them, along with previous results of 
Jarvella & Pisoni (1970), to support a clause-by- 
clause view of within-sentence processing. 
Later research on reading comprehension has 
found effects on gaze duration not only of word 
length and word frequency, but also of syntactic 
local ambiguity (garden paths) and of ends of 
sentences (Just & Carpenter 1984). However, 
the study of clause units as distinct from 
sentence units has not been carried out 
systematically in psycholinguistic experiments so 
far, and a lot of basic facts remain to be found 
out about the role of clause units of different 
kinds in the processes whereby spoken and 
written language is comprehended. 
2.2 The Definition of A Basic Clause 
Finding basic noun phrases is important as a 
stepping stone to finding clauses, on the 
assumption that an important subset of them 
have an initial sequence consisting of a noun 
phrase followed by a tensed verb as a defining 
characteristic. The result of scoring the 
respective success of the two methods of parsing 
basic noun phrases in sample text portions, 
reported in Ejerbed (1987), was the following. 
The regular expression output had 6 errors in 
185 noun phrases, i.e. a 3.3% error rate. The 
stochastic output had 3 errors in 218 noun 
phrases, i.e. a 1.4% error rate. Both results must 
be considered good in the absolute sense of an 
automatic analysis of unrestricted text, but the 
stochastic method has a clear advantage over the 
regular expression method. Basic noun phrases 
can be found, which is of important for clause 
recognition. 
The definition of basic clause that was used in 
this study has the following characteristics: a) it 
concentrates on certain defining characteristics 
present at the beginnings of clauses; b) it follows 
from a particular hypothesis about syntactic 
working memory: that it is limited to processing 
one clause at the time; and c) it assumes that the 
recognition of any beginning of a clause 
automatically eads to the syntactic losure of the 
previous clause. 
It should be clear from the above, that the 
theoretical reasons for pursuing a recursion-free 
definition of a basic clause have to do with a 
theory of linguistic performance, rather than with 
a theory of linguistic competence, in which 
memory limitations play no part. It is a 
hypothesis of the author's current clause-by- 
clause processing theory, that a unit 
corresponding to the basic clause is a stable and 
easily recognizable surface unit, and that it is 
also an important partial result and building 
block in the construction of a richer linguistic 
representation that encompasses syntax as well 
as semantics and discourse structure. 
2.3 A Regular 17rpression for Basic Clauses 
Several versions of a regular expression for basic 
clauses were written by the author and preceded 
the one presented in Appendix 1, which was, 
99N 220
applied to 60 files of Brown corpus tagged text 
of 2000 words each, newspaper texts A01-A20, 
scientific texts J01-J20 and fiction texts K01- 
K20. 
The first half of the definition of *clause* 
introduces a few auxiliary definitions: comp for a 
set of complementizers, punct for a set of 
punctuation marks, and tense for a set of verb 
forms that are either certainly tensed ("BED" 
"BEDZ .... BEM .... BER .... BEZ .... DOD .... DOZ" 
"HVD . . . .  HVZ . . . .  MD . . . .  V'BD . . . .  VBZ") or 
possibly tensed ("BE .... DO .... HV .... VB"). The 
definition of clause also uses the previously 
defined *brown-np-regex*. The second and 
larger part of the definition of *clause* consists 
of a union of six concatenations. 
The first defines complete main clauses as 
consisting of a sequence of an optional 
coordinating conjunction CC followed by an 
obligatory basic noun phrase followed by 
optional non-clausal complements and an 
optional adverb followed by an obligatory tensed 
verb followed by anything expcept the 
punctuations or complementizers indicated in the 
list after (not .... followed by optional 
punctuation. 
The second defines clauses introduced by an 
obligatory CC followed by an optional adverb 
followed by an obligatory element which is 
either a tensed or participial verb form, followed 
by the same clause ending as in the first 
definition. 
The third concatenation defines a subordinate 
clause as starting with an optional coordinating 
conjunction followed by an obligatory 
complementizer followed by the same clause 
ending as in the first and second definitions. 
The remaining three definitions are of clause 
fragments rather than full clauses. Consider the 
following sentence: The man \[who liked ice 
cream,\] ate too much. 
In it, the relative clause makes a basic clause 
unit that breaks up the main clause into two 
clause fragments. The third concatenation 
defines noun phrase fragments that begin with a 
basic noun phrase followed optionally by one or 
more prepositional phrases, or sequences of CC 
np or $ np, followed by the same clause ending 
as in the other definitions. In the example above, 
\[the man\] would be a noun phrase fragment. 
221 
The fifth concatenation defines verb phrase 
fragments, e.g. \[ate too much\]. 
The sixth concatenation defines clause fragments 
that are adjuncts, i.e. adverbial phrases, 
prepositional phrases and adjective phrases. The 
typical case in which such a fragment is 
recognized is when it precedes another clause: 
\[On a clear day,\] \[you can see forever\]. 
2.4 Output of Regular Expression for Clauses 
The regular expression in Appendix 1 was 
automatically expanded into a deterministic fsa 
for clause recognition by Church's program. This 
rule compilation will not be described here. An 
excerpt from the result of applying it to the 60 
files mentioned in the introduction to this section 
is presented in Appendix 2, where the location 
and nature of hand-corrections have been high- 
lighted. The hand-correction was guided by the 
following principles. 
1) There should be at most one tensed verb per 
clause. This inserts a clause boundary after a 
tensed clause and before a tensed verb in the 
following kind of case, which the current regular 
expression marcher does not capture: \[The 
announcement\] \[that the President was late\] 
\[was made late in the afternoon\]. 
2) There should be a clause boundary after a 
sentence initial prepositional or adverbial phrase 
and before the sequence np tensed verb, whether 
or not they are separated by a comma:\[At the 
summit in Iceland\] \[Gorbachev insisted ...\]. 
3) There should be a clause boundary before CC 
followed by a tensed verb. Although the second 
concatenation in the clause regex aimes at 
capturing such clauses, it is not always 
successful in doing so because there is no way, 
given the current implementation of negation in 
the regular expression program, to state that a 
clause should end before a concatenation of 
items, i.e. before (* CC tense). Only single 
items can be negated at present. Example: /The 
Purchasing Departments are well operated\] [and 
follow generally accepted practices\]. 
4) There should be a clause boundary before a 
preposition (IN) followed by a wh-word, i.e. 
before (* IN (+ WDT WPO WP$ WRB WQL)). 
For the same reason given under 3), there is no 
way currendy to state that a clause should end 
before such a sequence. Example: \[The City 
Executive Committee deserves praise for the 
manner\] [in which the election was conductedl. 
Several interesting observation were made in the 
course of doing these hand-corrections. For one, 
there were errors in the Brown corpus 
assignment of tags, in particular several errors 
confusing VBD and VBN, and there were errors 
where the sequence TO VB was tagged IN NN. 
More seriously, it turned out that the words as 
and like, which have the property of functioning 
either like prepostions IN or subordinating 
conjunctions CS were always tagged CS, thus 
leading to incorrect recognition of clauses in 
many cases. Another problem for recognizing 
clauses on the basis of identifying tensed verbs 
was that the tag VB is applied to forms that are 
either infinitival or present tensed (or 
subjunctive), depending on context. It would 
have been better if such forms had been 
considered lexically ambiguous and given 
distinct ags. However, by and large the tagged 
Brown corpus is a very good and useful product, 
both in the choice of tags, and in the consistency 
with which they have been applied. Doing the 
hand-correction also forced the realization that 
the clause recognition program, like the noun 
phrase recognition program, dependes crucially 
on accurate assignment of parts of speech to all 
words, on order to work well. For this task, 
Church's stochastic parts program is admirably 
suited, since it gives correct assignments in a 
very large number of cases, and it holds the 
potential of further improvement in its 
performance with further training. 
2.5 Stochastic Recognition of Clauses 
As stated before, the regex *clause* was applied 
to sixty texts in the Brown corpus, and the 
output was hand-corrected. The hand-corrected 
files, containing an estimated total of at least 
20,000 basic clauses, including clause fragments, 
were then used as training material for a 
stochastic recognition program. The training 
consisted of observing the location of clause 
opens and clause closes, and a special training 
specifically in locating tensed verbs. After 
training, the stochastic parts program and 
thereafter the stochastic lause recognizer was 
applied by K. Church to a large amount of 
Associated Press newswire text from May 26, 
1987 (526 blocks, 2381353(8) bytes). An 
excerpt of the result is presented in Appendix 3. 
The result, again, is strikingly good. 
A comparison of the nature and amount of errors 
in recognizing basic clauses in a sample of 
uncorrected regex output, and a sample of output 
222 
from the stochastic lause program, can be made 
on the basis of Tables I and 2 at the end. 
It appears that the stochastic program is more 
successful than the current regular expression 
method. However, certain improvements in the 
regex program could change that. What is 
needed is the facility to process generalized 
regular expressions, which admit the operations 
of complement and intersection, in addition to 
the operations of concatenation, union and 
Kleene star that characterize r gular expressions. 
In any case there axe some interesting differences 
in the kinds of errors made by the currant regex 
program and the stochastic one for recognizing 
clauses. The regex program systematically errs 
by underrecognizing, never by overrecognizing, 
and in the selected portions that were scored, it 
only puts a few clause boundaries in the wrong 
place. It misses lots of clause boundaries, but 
the ones it gets are mostly correct. 
The stochastic program, on the other hand, is 
able to get many clause boundaries correctly that 
elude the regular expression matcher, e.g. 
clauses not introduced by complementizers. The 
stochastic program errs both by overrecognizing 
and underrecognizing clauses, and sometimes it
also places the clause open or clause close in the 
wrong place. Some cases of incorrect clause 
recognition are due to incorrect assignments of 
parts of speech to words. However, the total 
number of errors with the stochastic method (21) 
is smaller than the total number of errors with 
the regex method (40), for approximately the 
same number of clauses to be recognized, 304 
versus 308. This is a very surprising outcome 
indeed, and if taken literally, without any further 
weighting of the different types of errors, it 
means that the error rate for the stochastic 
method for recognizing clauses is 6.5%, as 
compared with 13% for the regex method. 
3. On the Relation between Clauses and 
Into. ";on Units 
Finding baslt, tause units in arbitrary text is 
necessary in order to locate tonal minor phrases, 
which, in addition to a phrase accent, also have a 
boundary tone, and, particularly at slow rates of 
speech, a pause at the end of the phrase. The 
current experiment in text analysis has been 
concerned primarily with informative rather than 
imaginative prose, and envisages appLications of 
the text-to-speech system to the reading of 
informative prose like newspaper text. 
In the current Bell Labs text-to-speech system, 
tonal minor phrase boundaries are identified on 
the basis of commas, and tonal major phrase 
boundaries ate identified on the basis of periods. 
Finding more tonal minor phrase boundaries by 
using syntactic structure, in addition to 
punctuation, is the problem we are trying to 
address with the methods described in this paper. 
In order to know where tonal minor phrase 
boundaries actually occur in the reading of 
informative texts, which typically have very long 
sentences (an average of 21 words compared 
with 14 words in general fiction based on Brown 
corpus data), it would be necessary to make 
recordings of several persons reading both 
authentic and prepared texts in a rhetorically 
explicit way, to borrow a phrase from Beckman 
& Pierrehumbert (1986), and then make extensive 
speech analyses of them, particularly of 
fundamental frequency movements and pauses. 
In the absence of such data for American 
English, the following kinds of boundaries 
between clauses and clause fragments were 
hypothesized to constitute intonation breaks with 
the status of tonal minor phrase boundaries. They 
ale marked with # in the examples below. 
a) After sentence initial adverbials and before np 
tense: \[At the summit in Iceland\] # \[Gorbachev 
insisted...\] 
b) After a relative clause and before a tensed 
verb: \[A House Committee\] [which heard his 
local option proposal\] # \[is expected\] \[to give it 
a favorable report.\] 
c) After other noun phrases with clausal 
complements and before a tensed verb: \[The 
announcement\] \[that the President was late\] # 
\[was made by the Press Secretary to the waiting 
journalists.l 
d) Before a set of complementizers categorized 
CS in the Brown corpus, it is frequently the case 
that there is an intonation break: \[that/CS ...\], 
\[whether/CS ...\], \[iflCS ...\], \[since/CS ...\], 
\[because/CS ...1, \[as/CS ...1. 
However, there are some exceptions to this , in 
particular: 
(i) Comparatives: \[This is not as/QL fast/J \] 
\[as/CS I would like ... \] or \[The theorem is 
more/RBR general~J J\] \[thanlCS what we have 
described\] 
(ii) The words as/CS and like/CS when used as 
prepositions, i.e. followed by noun phrases that 
223 
are not subjects of clauses: \[Jenkins left the 
White House in 1984,\] \[and joined Wedtech\] 
\[as/CS its director of marketing two years later.\] 
For testing purposes, short passages of seven 
consecutive sentences each from the Brown files, 
and four sentences each from the AP newswire 
stories were synthesized by the author, using the 
Bell Labs text-to-speech system. Those 
boundaries between clauses and clause fragments 
that are identified above were implemented in 
the same way that commas are, i.e. with a phrase 
accent belonging to the tonal minor phrase, final 
lengthening, a boundary tone, and a short pause 
of 200 ms. The results have not yet been 
subjected to perceptual tests. 
There are some studies of the relation between 
clause units and intonation units that provide 
relevant data for future work. Garding (1967) 
studied prosodic features in spontaneous and 
read Swedish speech. She found that in the 
spontaneous speech, pauses were equally divided 
between syntactic pauses and hesitation pauses, a 
syntactic pause being defined as one that 
coincides with a syntactic boundary. In the read 
speech, all pauses were syntactic pauses: "They 
appear between main clause and subordinate 
clause, before adverbial modifiers and between 
the different parts of an enumeration. The pause 
length is shortest in enumerations and before 
relative clauses (4-10 cs) and longest before 
adverbial modifiers and between complete 
sentences." (p. 48). 
In a study of the intonational properties of 
relative clauses in British English, Taglicht 
(1977) compared the speech of a news broadcast 
with impromptu speech, and found that both 
genres separated nonrestrictive relative clauses 
prosodically. The news broadcast also separated 
a large proportion (71%) of the restrictive 
relative clauses prosodically. 
A recent and very extensive study of the 
grammtical properties of intonation units, or tone 
units (I'U) is Altenberg (1987). He studied a 
monologue of 48 minutes duration from the 
London-Lurid Corpus of spoken English, and his 
results concerning the correlation of clause 
boundaries and tone unit boundaries are 
presented in Table 3 at the end. 
4. Conclusion 
The study reported above shows that basic 
clauses, including basic noun phrases, are stable 
and surface recognizable units in the definitions 
they were given here, and that both finitary and 
stochastic methods can be used to find them in 
unrestricted text with a high degree of success. 
The comparison between the error rate of these 
two methods howed that the stochastic method 
performed better both in the recognition of basic 
noun phrases and basic clauses, which is an 
unexpected result.
