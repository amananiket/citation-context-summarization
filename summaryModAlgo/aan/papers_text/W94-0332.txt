Abstract  
We report on a head-driven way to generate a language- 
specific representation for a language-independent con- 
ceptual structure. With a grammar oriented towards 
conceptual rather than phrasal structure, the approach 
shows some advant~ages over previous works in head- 
driven generation. ~It is particularly suited for multi- 
lingual generation systems where language-independent 
representations andlprocesses should be maintained to a 
maximum extent. We briefly sketch the architecture of 
our Genie system based on some results of an analysis of 
a technical manual for a gearbox.

1 Int roduct ion  
The Genie system explores a way to rationalize multi- 
lingual production of technical documentation. The sys- 
tem is semi-automatic in that the user designs an inter- 
lingual text specification describing content and form for 
a document. Genie constructs the document in the de- 
sired languages as modelled by the specification, match- 
ing contents to a knowledge base, constructing categories, 
and forming sentences according to combinatory rules. 
The paper focusses on generation of language-specific 
categories from language independent conceptual struc- 
tures. 
2 The Document  Analys is  
We have chosen a ll0-page manual, English (\[3\]) and 
Swedish (\[8\]), of the truck gearbox R1000 to analyse. The 
manual is for expert servicemen and shows the design, 
function, and service instructions. 
The manual communicates some different kinds of do- 
main information. We choose here to concentrate on the 
following two: 
? Static information (i.e what something is). Exam- 
ples: 
(1) The R1000 is a gearbox. (2) The.gearbox has nine 
forward gears. (3) The gearbox is mechanically operated. 
(1) RIO00 ar en v~xell?da. (2) V?xell?dan hat nio v~xlar 
fram?t. (3) V~xell~dan manSvreras mekaniskt 
? Processive information (i.e what something does). 
Examples: 
(4) The purpose of the inhibitor valve is to prevent in- 
advertant shifting of the range gear when a gear in the 
basic box is in mesh. (5) The inhibitor cylinder prevents 
inadvertant shiRing in the basic box when range shifts 
are being carried out. 
(4) Sp~rrventilen har till uppgift att fbrhindra v~xling av 
rangev~xeln n~r n?gon av v~xlarna i basl?dan ligger i in- 
grepp. (5) Sp~rrcylindern f6rhindrar v~xling i basl?dan 
n~r v?xling reed rangen sker. 
The text can be broken down into approximately 
sentence-sized units, each one communicating a piece of 
information considered true in the domain. We observe 
a tight correspondence b tween the kind of information 
and its textual realization. The carefully defined termi- 
nology not only determines words, but their combina- 
tions as well. 
The text structure follows from conventions of lan- 
guage use for efficient communication about the domain.

These findings are in line with the issue of domain com- 
munication knowledge (Kittredge \[7\]). Rhsner and Stede 
(\[9\]) distinguish similarly between the macro and micro 
structure of texts. The architecture of Genie is built 
up around the division of sentence and text structure; 
the user incorporates the conventions in the specification 
while Genie provides the terminological definitions. 
The English and Swedish versions of the manual align 
at sentence level. Genie can cope with semantically non- 
equivalent sentence pairs, but not the very rare ones 
differing in content. Nevertheless, the documents cor- 
respond nicely compared to the difficulties Bateman re- 
ports (\[1\]) on a study of medical didactic texts. Grote 
and Rhsner (\[5\]) have studied car manuals for the TECH- 
DOC system, and they observe a close correspondence. 
We have employed Functional Grammar (FG) (c.f \[6\]) 
as a principal analysis tool to developing representations 
for domain and language. 
3 Domain  Representat ion  
Domain representation is based on conceptual structures 
(Sowa \[11\]) and the transitivity structure of FG. Concept 
nodes are typed in an inheritance network. We follow 
Sowa's definition and notation of conceptual graphs. 
Next, we sketch how static and processive information 
are represented as facts, called aspects and transitions, 
respectively, in the knowledge base. 
3.1 Aspects  
An aspect contains a simple conceptual graph where an 
object has an attributive relation to a value. We define 
the is-a link as attributive and the type becomes the 
value. Sentence (1) and (2) are: 
\[rlO00\] - -  (isa) --* \[gearbox\] 
\[riO00\] --* (f-gears) -+ \[f-gear:colllfl, f2, ..., f9}@9\] 
Both aspects happen to be close to their linguistic real- 
izations, which is not necessarily always the case. 
3 .2  T rans i t ions  
A transition is a concept trans with three relations, pre, 
means, and post. means has an event as value, pre and 
post hold circumstances that obtain before and after the 
event has occurred. 
An event carries mandatory, e.g actor, goal, and pe- 
ripheral role relations, e.g instr to other objects. We can 
differentiate roles into subtypes, e.g i-instr inhibits the 
event. 
A circumstance can be: (i) a state characterized as a 
setting of some variable parameter. An example is in the 
aspect for sentence (4): 
\[ trans\] -
(pre) -~ \[ basic-boz-gears: disj { * ) \] - 
(in-mesh) --* \[4-\] 
(means) ~ \[range-shifting\]- 
( i-instr) ---~ \[ inh-valve\] 
(if) As an event, exhibited by sentence (5): 
\[trans\] - 
(gen-dur-pre)-  \[trans\] - 
(means)--~ \[range-shifting\] 
(means) ~ \[basic-box-shifting\]- 
( i-instr) \ [ inh-cyO 
Sub-events have their own transitions as value for pre and 
post, which allows us to link events together, gen-dur-pre 
is a version of pre used to give a meaning to "... being 
carried out". 
Transitions are more powerful than what has been out- 
lined here. Much of their internal temporal constituency, 
complex parameters, lambda-abstractions, and different 
kinds of constraints have been left out for clarity. 
4 L ingu is t ic  Representat ion  
This section describes how Genie derives categories for 
a fact, as part of generation. We first describe English 
categories briefly. 
4 .1  Categor ies  
Categories are expressed in a language of typed feature 
structures. We define how categories can be formed, their 
different ypes and content. 
Construction of categories are inspired by modern Cat- 
egorial Grammars (CG), such as UCG (c.f \[12\]), but dif- 
fer in some respects. The set of categories g is defined 
recursively, (i) Basic categories E g. (if) If A and B E g, 
then the complex category AIB E g. 
The differences from CG are (i) the association of cat- 
egories to facts and concepts, and (if) complex categories 
are non-directed. 
Categories compose using the reduction rule to unify: 
AIB, B ~ A 
Categories are expressed as typed feature structures (tfs) 
(c.f Carpenter \[2\]). a(name) denotes the set of attributes 
the type name carries, and s(name) the immediate sub- 
types, cat is the root with a(cat) = {}, s(cat) = 
{zcat, bcat), xcat is the I operator, bcat are the basic 
categories, a(bcat) = {:fb, s t ) ,  s(bcat) = {Icat,pcat). 
Icat and pcat are the lexical and phrasal categories. The 
attribute fb holds some feature bundle, rooted at fb and 
named appropriately, e.g np-fb, n-fb, agr-fb, st has a FG 
246

mood-structure to hold subcategories. A peat has a cer- 
tain tfs under the type st to encode the structure, while 
a lcat has a pointer into a surface lexicon, s-st is the 
structure for clauses. Elements are coded as attributes, 
e.g subj, fin, compl etc. 
4.2 Conceptual Grammar 
Facts are associated to categories composed of those ob- 
tained from the conceptual constituents. The grammar 
rules state that a particular domain type corresponds to 
a category with certain combinatorial properties. If vi- 
olated, the rule cannot derive an adequate category for 
the fact. Concept nodes are associated to a number of 
categories as defined by lexical rules. 
We call this a conceptual grammar, since it is tied to 
conceptual rather than phrase structures. The rules are 
language independent as the linguistic material is effec- 
tively hidden within the basic categories. Rules have the 
following notation: 
<head> when <body>. 
<head> carries an association of the general form cs 
cat, where cs is a conceptual structure, and cat is 
the category. _<head> holds whenever all constraints in
<body> hold 1. Help associations (arrow with a symbol 
on top) support ~ with extra material. We describe 
rules for atoms, objects, aspects and transitions. 
4.2.1 Atoms and Objects 
atoms have a rather simple and direct association: 
\[mechanicaO ~ a\[st:mechanicaO 
\[9\] ~ det\[fb:det-fb\[agr: agr-fb\[numb:p~\] 
s'g :ng\]' 
The type of category depends on how it will be used, but 
should be basic. The examples are typical. 
The object R10001gives "a gearbox" in: 
\[r10001 
cnp\[fb: np-fb\[agr :Agr-- agr-fb\[numb :sg, pers: 3rd\] 
spee:inde)~ 
s c: np-st\[n: \[fb: n-fb\[agr:Agr\] 
st: gearbozl\]\] 
There are potentially many alternative associations. Lex- 
ical choice is not addressed in this paper, although we 
recognize its necessity in generation systems. 
4.2.2 Aspects 
The category for the relation in an aspect is seen as a 
function of the categories for the two concepts. The 
1 Like a Prolog rule. ! 
grammar ule for aspects fetches and applies the func- 
tion. A relation operation, as in the aspect for sentence 
(3), has a category slnpla: 
\[operation\] 
s\[st:s-st\[subj :Subj 
fin:v\[fb: -\] \[pass:+, agr:agr= ag -N\] 
pred: v\[st: ope ration\] 
compl:Compl\]\] I 
Subj=np\[fb:np-fbKagr:agr\]\] l 
Compl= a\[fb: a-y \[aav: +\]\] 
The rule says that one category should fill the compl 
element as an adverbial, and another to become an np in 
the subj element. Note the subject-verb agreement. 
The aspect rule simply reduces the relation category 
with the categories obtained from the concepts: 
O=\[concept\] - rt=(re0 V=\[concept\] A 
when 
R ~ A=catlB=catlC=cat, V ~ C, 0 ~ B. 
An aspect is matched to the right hand side of the head 
to bind the variables O, R and V. The rule proves the 
following category for sentence (3): 
\[rlO00\] ~ (operation) - -  \[mechanica 0 
4 t: -st\[subj : ndfb:np-5\[agr:agr= agr 5\[n b:sg 
pers:3rd\] 
spec:/nde\]\] 
 t:gearbo \]\]\] 
f in: v\[fb: v-Jb~as s:+ 
agr:agr= agr-fb\]\] 
pred: v\[ st  : ope ration\] 
compl: a\[fb: a-fb lady :-/-\] 
st:mechanica~\]\] 
4.2.3 Transit ions 
associations for transitions are more complex, but still 
compositional. The idea is to get a category for the event 
and reduce it with all roles to obtain a basic category. 
This is reduced with the transition type category and 
with those for pre and post relations and values. 
The association for trans is defined by the rule: 
Trans=\[trans\] - 
(means) -- Ev=\[event\] 
Pre-R=(pre) ~ Pre-C=concept 
Post-R=(post) --~ Post-C=concept 
Res when 
Trans ~ Resl=cat\[Event=cat 
Pre-R ~ Res2= cat IResl \[Pre= cat 
Pre-C ~ Pre 
Post-R ~ Res\[Res21Post=ca~ 
Post-C ~ Post, Ev ==-z Event 
247

The transition is matched to bind variables in the head. 
retrieves the complex category of one argument for 
the mandatory event, pre and post are optional and have 
their own categories, e.g: 
\[gen-dur-pre\]=~ SlPre=progressive-s\] S=s\[st:s-st\[pre:Pre\]\] 
The category constrains the category in the pre to be a 
progressive-s. The rule for events basically looks like: 
EV=\[event\] - 
(mre/) ~ OMl=\[concept\] 
(rare 0 -- OMn=\[concept\] 
PRl=(pre0 OPl=\[concep \] 
Prtm=(pre0 -- OPm=\[concep \] 
RES=ca~ when 
EV ~ PCAT0=cat\]ARGn=cat\] . . . \ ]ARGi= cat 
for i=l . .n  do OMi :::::::?~ ARGi 
for j= l . .m do 
PRj ~ PCAT j=cat IPCAT j_ i=cat IARGj=cat  
OPj ~ ARGj 
RES = PCATm 
The event category reduces with the mandatory role 
values to reveal the innermost result category for the 
event. It will then reduce with the peripheral roles.

4.3 Discussion 
The conceptual grammar is a semantic-head grammar,  
where the semantic head is the top node of the graph a 
rule analyzes? The grammar processor is a plain Pro- 
log resolution. It behaves as the standard semantic- 
head driven generator (SHDG) (Shieber et al\[10\]) does 
when all nodes are pivots, i.e a purely top-down man- 
ner. SHDGs in general are quite different from ours in 
the way knowledge is organized. They follow the struc- 
ture of categories in grammars that are more suitable for 
parsing, i.e allowing content-less words but not word-less 
contents. Hence, there is an assymetry between compo- 
sitionality of words and semantics (Dymetman \[4\]). A 
content-less word can potentially occur anywhere in the 
output string and a generator must consider this to ter- 
minate gracefully. Problems of ensuring coherence and 
completeness degrade efficiency further. Our generator 
resembles a parser to a large extent, having a conceptual 
structure instead of a string to work on. As such, it is 
free from the problems and can potentially benefit di- 
rectly from many research results in parsing technology. 
The rules are designed to work on any language, thus 
lessening the burden when adding more linguistic sup- 
port. More rules have to be written only when new 
kinds of facts are added to the knowledge base, to ac- 
count for their structures. We do not need a reachability 
relation, as the problem of goal-directedness in genera- 
tion is achieved by doing clever choices of categories in 
lexical rules. 
The relations between domain types and categories are 
similar to the semantic type assignments in classic CGs. 
Our version is more flexible as a consequence of the type 
system. 
Genie is in an experimental state (about 20 aspects and 
10 transitions), but has proven feasability of the issues 
discussed in this paper. It  is less competent in lexical 
choice and the combinatory grammar.  Development is
continuing in the Life environment.
