Abstract 
There are two main methodologies for 
constructing the knowledge base of a 
natural language analyser: the linguis- 
tic and the data-driven. Recent state-of- 
the-art part-of-speech taggers are based 
on the data-driven approach. Because 
of the known feasibility of the linguis- 
tic rule-based approach at related levels 
of description, the success of the data- 
driven approach in part-of-speech analy- 
sis may appear surprising. In this paper, 
a case is made for the syntactic nature 
of part-of-speech tagging. A new tagger 
of English that uses only linguistic dis- 
tributional rules is outlined and empiri- 
cally evaluated. Tested against a bench- 
mark corpus of 38,000 words of previ- 
ously unseen text, this syntax-based sys- 
tem reaches an accuracy of above 99%. 
Compared to the 95-97% accuracy of its 
best competitors, this result suggests the 
feasibility of the linguistic approach also 
in part-of-speech analysis. 
1 Introduct ion 
Part-of-speech analysis usually consists of (i) in- 
troduction of ambiguity (lexical analysis) and (ii) 
disambiguation (elimination of illegitimate alter- 
natives). While introducing ambiguity is regarded 
as relatively straightforward, disambiguation is
known to be a difficult and controversial problem. 
There are two main methodologies: the linguistic 
and the data-driven. 
? In the linguistic approach, the generalisa- 
tions are based on the linguist's (poten- 
tially corpus-based) abstractions about the 
paradigms and syntagms of the language. 
Distributional generalisations are manually 
coded as a grammar, a system of constraint 
rules used for discarding contextually illegit- 
imate analyses. The linguistic approach is 
labour-intensive: skill and effort is needed for 
writing an exhaustive grammar. 
? In the data-driven approach, frequency-based 
information is automatically derived from 
corpora. The learning corpus can consist of 
plain text, but the best results seem achiev- 
able with annotated corpora (Merialdo 1994; 
Elworthy 1994). This corpus-based informa- 
tion typically concerns equences of 1-3 tags 
or words (with some well-known exceptions, 
e.g. Cutting et al 1992). Corpus-based infor- 
mation can be represented e.g. as neural net- 
works (Eineborg and Gamb/~c k 1994; Schmid 
1994), local rules (Brill 1992), or collocational 
matrices (Garside 1987). In the data-driven 
approach, no human effort is needed for rule- 
writing. However, considerable effort may be 
needed for determining a workable tag set (cf. 
Cutting 1994) and annotating the training 
corpus. 
At the first flush, the linguistic approach may 
seem an obvious choice. A part-of-speech tagger's 
task is often illustrated with a noun-verb ambigu- 
ous word directly preceded by an unambiguous de- 
terminer (e.g. table in the table). This ambiguity 
can reliably be resolved with a simple and obvious 
grammar rule that disallows verbs after determin- 
ers. 
Indeed, few contest he fact that reliable linguis- 
tic rules can be written for resolving some part- 
of-speech ambiguities. The main problem with 
this approach seems to be that resolving part-of- 
speech ambiguities on a large scale, without intro- 
ducing a considerable rror margin, is very diffi- 
cult at best. At least, no rule-based system with 
a convincing accuracy has been reported so far. 1 
As a rule, data-driven systems rely on statisti- 
cal generalisations about short sequences of words 
or tags. Though these systems do not usually 
employ information about long-distance phenom- 
1There is one potential exception: the rule-based 
morphological disambiguator used in the English 
Constraint Grammar Parser ENGCG (Voutilainen, 
Heikkil? and Anttila 1992). Its recall is very high 
(99.7% of all words receive the correct morphologi- 
cal analysis), but this system leaves 3-7% of all words 
ambiguous, trading precision for recall. 
157 
ena or the linguist's abstraction capabilities (e.g. 
knowledge about what is relevant in the context), 
they tend to reach a 95-97% accuracy in the anal- 
ysis of several anguages, in particular English 
(Marshall 1983; Black et aL 1992; Church 1988; 
Cutting et al 1992; de Marcken 1990; DeRose 
1988; Hindle 1989; Merialdo 1994; Weischedel et 
al. 1993; Brill 1992; Samuelsson 1994; Eineborg 
and Gamb~ick 1994, etc.). Interestingly, no sig- 
nificant improvement beyond the 97% "barrier" 
by means of purely data-driven systems has been 
reported so far. 
In terms of the accuracy of known systems, 
the data-driven approach seems then to pro- 
vide the best model of part-of-speech distribu- 
tion. This should appear a little curious because 
very competitive results have been achieved us- 
ing the linguistic approach at related levels of de- 
scription. With respect o computational mor- 
phology, witness for instance the success of the 
Two-Level paradigm introduced by Koskenniemi 
(1983): extensive morphological descriptions have 
been made of more than 15 typologically dif- 
ferent languages (Kimmo Koskenniemi, personal 
communication). With regard t.o computational 
syntax, see for instance (GiingSrdii and Oflazer 
1994; Hindle 1983; Jensen, Heidorn and Richard- 
son (eds.) 1993; McCord 1990; Sleator and Tem- 
perley 1991; Alshawi (ed.) 1992; Strzalkowski 
1992). The present success of the statistical ap- 
proach in part-of-speech analysis eems then to 
form an exception to the general feasibility of the 
rule-based linguistic approach. Is the level of parts 
of speech somehow different, perhaps less rule- 
governed, than related levels? 2 
We do not need to assume this idiosyncratic sta- 
tus entirely. The rest of this paper argues that also 
parts of speech can be viewed as a rule-governed 
phenomenon, possible to model using the linguis- 
tic approach. However, it will also be argued that 
though the distribution of parts of speech can to 
some extent be described with rules specific to this 
level of representation, a more natural account 
could be given using rules overtly about the form 
and function of essentially syntactic ategories. A 
syntactic grammar appears to predict the distri- 
bution of parts of speech as a "side effect". In this 
sense parts of speech seem to differ from morphol- 
ogy and syntax: their status as an independent 
level of linguistic description appears doubtful. 
Before proceeding further with the main argu- 
ment, consider three very recent hybrids - sys- 
tems that employ linguistic rules for resolving 
some of the ambiguities before using automati- 
cally generated corpus-based information: collo- 
cation matrices (Leech, Garside and Bryant 1994), 
Hidden Markov Models (Tapanainen and Voutilai- 
nen 1994), or syntactic patterns (Tapanainen and 
2For related discussion, cf. Sampson (1987) and 
Church (1992). 
J~irvinen 1994). What is interesting in these hy- 
brids is that they, unlike purely data-driven tag- 
gers, seem capable of exceeding the 97% barrier: 
all three report an accuracy of about 98.5%. 3 The 
success of these hybrids could be regarded as evi- 
dence for the syntactic aspects of parts of speech. 
However, the above hybrids till contain a data- 
driven component, i.e. it remains an open question 
whether a tagger entirely based on the linguistic 
approach can compare with a data-driven system. 
Next, a new system with the following properties 
is outlined and evaluated: 
? The tagger uses only linguistic distributional 
rules. 
? Tested agMnst a 38,000-word corpus of previ- 
ously unseen text, the tagger eaches abetter 
accuracy than previous ystems (over 99%). 
? At the level of linguistic abstraction, the 
grammar rules are essentially syntactic. Ide- 
ally, part-of-speech disambiguation should 
fall out as a "side effect" of syntactic anal- 
ysis. 
Section 2 outlines a rule-based system consist- 
ing of the ENGCG tagger followed by a finite- 
state syntactic parser (Voutilainen and Tapanai- 
nen 1993; Voutilainen 1994) that resolves remain- 
ing part-of-speech ambiguities as a side effect. 
In Section 3, this rule-based system is tested 
against a 38,000-word corpus of previously unseen 
text. Currently tagger evaluation is only becom- 
ing standardised; the evaluation method is accord- 
ingly reported in detail. 
2 System description 
The tagger consists of the following sequential 
components: 
? Tokeniser 
? ENGCG morphological nalyser 
- Lexicon 
- Morphological heuristics 
? ENGCG morphological disambiguator 
? Lookup of alternative syntactic tags 
? Finite state syntactic disambiguator 
2.1 Morphological analysis 
The tokeniser is a rule-based system for identify- 
ing words, punctuation marks, document markers, 
and fixed syntagms (multiword prepositions, cer- 
tain compounds etc.). 
The morphological description consists of two 
rule components: (i) the lexicon and (ii) heuristic 
rules for analysing unrecognised words. 
The English Koskenniemi-style lexicon contains 
over 80,000 lexical entries, each of which repre- 
sents all inflected and some derived surface forms. 
3However ,  CLAWS4 (Leech, Gazside and Bryant 
1994) leaves ome ambiguities unresolved; i t  uses  por t -  
manteau  tags for representing them. 
158 
The lexicon employs 139 tags mainly for part of 
speech, inflection and derivation; for instance: 
"<,hat>"  
" that"  <**CLB> CS 
"that" DET CENTRAL DEM SG 
"that" ADV 
"that" PRON DEM SG 
"that" <Rel> PRON SG/PL 
The morphological analyser produces about 
180 different tag combinations. To contrast 
the ENGCG morphological description with 
the well-known Brown Corpus tags: ENGCG 
is more distinctive in that a part-of-speech 
distinction is spelled out in the description 
of (i) determiner-pronoun, (ii) preposition- 
conjunction, (iii) determiner-adverb-pronoun, 
and (iv) subjunctive-imperative-infinitive-pres- 
ent tense homographs. On the other hand, 
ENGCG does not spell out part-of-speech ambi- 
guity in the description of (i) -ing and nonfinite 
-ed forms, (ii) noun-adjective homographs with 
similar core meanings, or (iii) abbreviation-proper 
noun-common noun homographs. 
"Morphological heuristics" is a rule-based mod- 
ule for the analysis of those 1-5% of input words. 
not represented in the lexicon. This module em- 
ploys ordered hand-grafted rules that base their 
analyses on word shape. If none of the pattern 
rules apply, a nominal reading is assigned as a de- 
fault. 
2.2 ENGCG d isambiguator  
A Constraint Grammar can be viewed as a 
collection 4 of pattern-action rules, no more than 
one for each ambiguity-forming tag. Each rule 
specifies one or more context patterns, or "con- 
straints", where the tag is illegitimate. If any of 
these context patterns are satisfied uring disam- 
biguation, the tag is deleted; otherwise it is left in- 
tact. The context patterns can be local or global, 
and they can refer to ambiguous or unambiguous 
analyses. During disambiguatiop, the context can 
become less ambiguous. To help a pattern defining 
an unambiguous context match, several passes are 
made over the sentence during disambiguation. 
The current English grammar contains 1,185 
linguistic constraints on the linear order of mor- 
phological tags. Of these, 844 specify a context 
that extends beyond the neighboring word; in this 
limited sense, 71% of the constraints are global. 
Interestingly, the constraints are partial and of- 
ten negative paraphrases of 23 general, essentially 
syntactic generalisations about the form of the 
noun phrase, the prepositional phrase, the finite 
verb chain etc. (Voutilainen 1994). 
4Actually, it is possible to define additional heuris- 
tic rule collections that can optionally be applied af- 
ter the more reliable ones for resolving remahdng 
ambiguities. 
The grammar avoids risky'predictions, therefore 
3-7% of all words remain ambiguous (an average 
1.04-1.08 alternative analyses per output word). 
On the other hand, at least 99.7% of all words 
retain the correct morphological nalysis. Note in 
passing that the ratio 1.04-1.08/99.7% compares 
very favourably with other systems; c.f. 3.0/99.3% 
by POST (Weischedel et al 1993) and 1.04/97.6% 
or 1.09/98.6% by de Marcken (1990). 
There is an additional collection of 200 option- 
ally applicable heuristic onstraints that are based 
on simplified linguistic generalisations. They re- 
solve about half of the remaining ambiguities, in- 
creasing the overall error rate to about 0.5%. 
Most of even the remaining ambiguities are 
structurally resolvable. ENGCG leaves them 
pending mainly because it is prohibitively diffi- 
cult to express certain kinds of structural gener- 
alisation using the available rule formalism and 
grammatical representation. 
2.3 Syntact ic  analysis  
2.3.1 F in i te -S ta te  In tersect ion  Grammar  
Syntactic analysis is carried out in another e- 
ductionistic parsing framework nown as Finite- 
State Intersection Grammar (Koskenniemi 1990; 
Koskenniemi, Tapanainen and Voutilainen 1992; 
Tapanainen 1992; Voutilainen and Tapanainen 
1993; Voutilainen 1994). A short introduction: 
? Also here syntactic analysis means resolu- 
tion of structural ambiguities. Morphologi- 
cal, syntactic and clause boundary descrip- 
tors are introduced as ambiguities with sim- 
ple mappings; these ambiguities are then re- 
solved in parallel. 
? The formalism does not distinguish between 
various types of ambiguity; nor are ambiguity 
class specific rule sets needed. A single rule 
often resolves all types of ambiguity, though 
superficially it may look e.g. like a rule about 
syntactic functions. 
? The grammarian can define constants and 
predicates using regular expressions. For in- 
stance, the constants "." and ".." accept any 
features within a morphological reading and 
a finite clause (that may even contain centre- 
embedded clauses), respectively. Constants 
and predicates can be used in rules, e.g. im- 
plication rules that are of the form 
X => 
LC1 _ RC1,  
LC2 _ RC2, 
, , ,  
LCn _ RCn; 
Here X, LC1, RC1, LC2 etc. are regular ex- 
pressions. The rule reads: "X is legitimate 
only i f  it occurs in context LC1 _ RC1 or in 
context LC2 _ RC2 ... or in context LCn _ 
RCn". 
159 
? Also the ambiguous sentences are represented 
as regular expressions. 
? Before parsing, rules and sentences are com- 
piled into deterministic finite-state automata. 
? Parsing means intersecting the (ambiguous) 
sentence automaton with each rule automa- 
ton. Those sentence readings accepted by all 
rule automata re proposed as parses. 
? In addition, heuristic rules can be used for 
ranking alternative analyses accepted by the 
strict rules. 
2.3.2 Grammat ica l  representat ion  
The grammatical representation used in the 
Finite State framework is an extension of the 
ENGCG syntax. Surface-syntactic grammatical 
relations are encoded with dependency-oriented 
functional tags. Functional representation of 
phrases and clauses has been introduced to fa- 
cilitate expressing syntactic generMisations. The 
representation is introduced in (Voutilainen and 
Tapanainen 1993; Voutilainen 1994); here, only 
the main characteristics are given: 
? Each word boundary is explicitly represented 
as one of five alternatives: 
- the sentence boundary "@@" 
- the boundary separating juxtaposed fi- 
nite clauses "@/" 
-centre-embedded (sequences of) finite 
clauses are flanked with "@<" and "@>" 
- the plain word boundary "@" 
? Each word is furnished with a tag indicating a
surface-syntactic function (subject, premodi- 
tier, auxiliary, main verb, adverbial, etc.). All 
main verbs are furnished with two syntactic 
tags, one indicating its main verb status, the 
other indicating the function of the clause. 
? An explicit difference is made between finite 
and nonfinite clauses. Members in nonfinite 
clauses are indicated with lower case tags; the 
rest with upper case. 
? In addition to syntactic tags, also morpholog- 
ical, e.g. part-of-speech tags are provided for 
each word. Let us illustrate with a simplified 
example.

Here Mary is a subject in a finite clause 
(hence the upper case); told is a main verb in 
a main clause; ghe, fag and bugcher's are pre- 
modifiers; wife and daughgers are indirect ob- 
jects; that is a subordinating conjunction; re- 
members i a main verb in a finite clause that 
serves the Object role in a finite clause (the 
regent being gold); seeing is a main verb in a 
nonfinite clause (hence the lower case) that 
also serves the Object role in a finite clause; 
dream is an object in a nonfinite clause; night 
is an adverbial. Because only boundaries sep- 
arating finite clauses are indicated, there is 
only one sentence-internal clause boundary, 
"@/" between daughters and that. 
This kind of representation seeks to be (i) suf- 
ficiently expressive for stating grammatical gener- 
Misations in an economical and transparent fash- 
ion and (ii) sufficiently underspecific to make for 
a structurally resolvable grammatical representa- 
tion. For example, the present way of functionally 
accounting for clauses enables the grammarian to 
. express rules about the coordination of formally 
different but functionally similar entities. Regard- 
ing the resolvability requirement, certain kinds of 
structurMly unresolvable distinctions are never in- 
troduced. For instance, the premodifier tag @>N 
only indicates that its head is a nominal in the 
right hand context. 
2.3.3 - A sample  ru le  
Here is a realistic implication rule that partially 
defines the form of prepositional phrases: 
PREP => 
- . @ Coord ,  
_ . .PrepComp, 
PassVChain..  <Deferred> . _, 
PostModiCl . .  <Deferred> . _, 
WH-Question..  <Deferred> . _ ; 
A preposition is followed by a coordination or a 
preposition complement (here hidden in the con- 
stant ..PrepComp that accepts e.g. noun phrases, 
nonfinite clauses and nominal clauses), or it (as 
a 'deferred' preposition) is preceded by a pas- 
sive verb chain Pass VChain.. or a postmodifying 
clause PostModiCl.. (the main verb in a postmod- 
ifying clause is furnished with the postmodifier 
tag N< @) or of a WH-question (i.e. in the same 
clause, there is a WH-word). If the tag PREP oc- 
curs in none of the specified contexts, the sentence 
reading containing it is discarded. 
A comprehensive parsing grammar is under de- 
velopment. Currently it accounts for all major 
syntactic structures of English, but in a somewhat 
underspecific fashion. Though the accuracy of the 
160 
grammar at the level of syntactic analysis can still 
be considerably improved, the syntactic grammar 
is already capable of resolving morphological m- 
biguities left pending by ENGCG. 
3 An experiment with 
part-of-speech disambiguation 
The system was tested against a 38,202-word test 
corpus consisting of previously unseen journalis- 
tic, scientific and manual texts. 
The finite-state parser, the last module in the 
system, can in principle be "forced" to produce 
an unambiguous analysis for each input sentence, 
even for ungrammatical ones. In practice, the 
present implementation sometimes fails to give an 
analysis to heavily ambiguous inputs, regardless 
of their grammaticality. 5 Therefore two kinds of 
output were accepted for the evaluation: (i) the 
unambiguous analyses actually proposed by the 
finite-state parser, and (ii) the ENGCG analysis 
of those sentences for which the finite-state parser 
gave no analyses. From this nearly unambiguous 
combined output, the success of the hybrid was 
measured, by automatically comparing it with a 
benchmark version of the test corpus at the level. 
of morphological (including part-of-speech) anal- 
ysis (i.e. the syntax tags were ignored). 
3.1 Creat ion  of  benchmark  corpus 
The benchmark corpus was created by first apply- 
ing the preprocessor and morphological nalyser 
to the test text. This morphologically analysed 
ambiguous text was then independently disam- 
biguated by two experts whose task also was to de- 
tect any errors potentially produced by the previ- 
ously applied components. They worked indepen- 
dently, consulting written documentation of the 
grammatical representation when necessary. Then 
these manually disambiguated versions were au- 
tomatically compared. At this stage, slightly over 
99% of all analyses were identical. When the dif- 
ferences were collectively examined, it was agreed 
that virtually all were due to inattention. 6 One 
of these two corpus versions was modified to rep- 
resent the consensus, and this 'consensus corpus' 
was used as the benchmark in the evaluation. 7 
3.2  Resu l ts  
The results are given in Figure 1 (next page). 
Let us examine the results. ENGCG accuracy 
was close to normal, except hat the heuristic on- 
5During the intersection, the sentence automaton 
sometimes becomes prohibitively large. 
6Only in the analysis of a few headings, different 
(meaning-level) interpretations arose, and even here 
it was agreed by both judges that this ambiguity was 
genuine. 
7If this high consensus level appears urprising, see 
Voutilainen and J?rvinen (this volume). 
stralnts (tagger D2) performed somewhat poorer 
than usual. 
The finite-state parser gave an analysis to about 
80% of all words. Overall, 0.6% of all words re- 
mained ambiguous (due to the failure of the Finite 
State parser; c.f. Section 3). Parsing speed varied 
greatly (0.1-150 words/see.) -ref inement of the 
Finite State software is still underway. 
The overall success of the system is very encour- 
aging - 99.26% of all words retained the correct 
morphological nalysis. Compared to the 95-97% 
accuracy of the best competing probabilistic part- 
of-speech taggers, this accuracy, achieved with an 
entirely rule-based escription, suggests that part- 
of-speech disambiguation is a syntactic problem. 
The misanalyses have not been studied in detail, 
but some general observations can be made: 
? Many misanalyses made by the Finite State 
parser were due to ENGCG misanalyses (the 
"domino effect"). 
? The choice between adverbs and other cate- 
gories was sometimes difficult. The distribu- 
tions of adverbs and certain other categories 
overlaps; this may explain this error type. 
Lexeme-oriented constraints could be formu- 
lated for some of these cases. 
* Some ambiguities, e.g. noun-verb and 
participle-past tense, were problematic. This 
is probably due to the fact that while the 
parsing grammar always requires a regent for 
a dependent, it is much more permissive on 
dependentless regents. Clause boundaries, 
and hence the internal structure of clauses, 
could probably be determined more accu- 
rately if the heuristic part of the grammar 
also contained rules for preferring e.g. verbs 
with typical complements over verbs without 
complements. 
4 Conclusion 
Part-of-speech disambiguation has recently been 
tackled best with data-driven techniques. Lin- 
guistic techniques have done well at related lev- 
els (morphology, syntax) but not here. Is there 
something in parts of speech that makes them less 
accessible to the rule-based linguistic approach? 
This paper outlines and evaluates a new part- 
of-speech tagger. It uses only linguistic distribu- 
tional rules, yet reaches an accuracy clearly better 
than any competing system. This suggests that 
also parts of speech are a rule-governed distribu- 
tional phenomenon. 
The tagger has two rule components. One is 
a grammar specifically developed for resolution 
of part-of-speech ambiguities. Though much ef- 
fort was given to its development, i  leaves many 
ambiguities unresolved. These rules, superficially 
about parts of speech, actually express essentially 
syntactic generalisations, though indirectly and

grammar. This syntactic grammar is able to re- 
solve the pending part-of-speech ambiguities as a 
side effect. 
In short: like morphology and syntax, parts of 
speech seem to be a rule-governed phenomenon. 
However, the best distributional ccount of parts 
of speech appears achievable by means of a syn- 
tactic grammar, s

Appendix 
Enclosed is a sample output of the system. Syntax 
tags have been retained; base forms and some tags 
have been removed for better readability. The 
syntactic tags used here are the following: 
* ~>A premodifier of adjective, adverb or quan- 
tifier, 
* @>N noun premodi f ier ,  
? @N< noun postmodifier, 
? @ADVL adverbial, 
. @ADVL/N< adverbial or noun postmodifier, 
? ~OBJ  object in a finite clause, 
? @IOBJ indirect object in a finite clause, 
? ~SUBJ  subject in a finite clause, 
? ~ob j  object in a nonfinite clause, 
? ~P<< preposition complement, 
. @nh nominal head, 
? ~CC coordinating conjunction, 
? @CS subordinating conjunction, 
? ~MV main verb in a finite clause, 
? ~aux  auxiliary in a nonfinite clause, 
? ~mv main verb in a nonfinite clause, 
* ADVL~ adverbial clause, 
? MC~ finite main clause, 
* OBJ(~ clause as an object in a finite clause.
