Abstract
How can the development of ideas in a sci-
entific field be studied over time? We ap-
ply unsupervised topic modeling to the ACL
Anthology to analyze historical trends in the
field of Computational Linguistics from 1978
to 2006. We induce topic clusters using Latent
Dirichlet Allocation, and examine the strength
of each topic over time. Our methods find
trends in the field including the rise of prob-
abilistic methods starting in 1988, a steady in-
crease in applications, and a sharp decline of
research in semantics and understanding be-
tween 1978 and 2001, possibly rising again
after 2001. We also introduce a model of the
diversity of ideas, topic entropy, using it to
show that COLING is a more diverse confer-
ence than ACL, but that both conferences as
well as EMNLP are becoming broader over
time. Finally, we apply Jensen-Shannon di-
vergence of topic distributions to show that all
three conferences are converging in the topics
they cover.
1 Introduction
How can we identify and study the exploration of
ideas in a scientific field over time, noting periods of
gradual development, major ruptures, and the wax-
ing and waning of both topic areas and connections
with applied topics and nearby fields? One im-
portant method is to make use of citation graphs
(Garfield, 1955). This enables the use of graph-
based algorithms like PageRank for determining re-
searcher or paper centrality, and examining whether
their influence grows or diminishes over time.
However, because we are particularly interested
in the change of ideas in a field over time, we have
chosen a different method, following Kuhn (1962).
In Kuhn?s model of scientific change, science pro-
ceeds by shifting from one paradigm to another.
Because researchers? ideas and vocabulary are con-
strained by their paradigm, successive incommensu-
rate paradigms will naturally have different vocabu-
lary and framing.
Kuhn?s model is intended to apply only to very
large shifts in scientific thought rather than at the
micro level of trends in research foci. Nonetheless,
we propose to apply Kuhn?s insight that vocabulary
and vocabulary shift is a crucial indicator of ideas
and shifts in ideas. Our operationalization of this in-
sight is based on the unsupervised topic model La-
tent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA; Blei et al (2003)).
For many fields, doing this kind of historical study
would be very difficult. Computational linguistics
has an advantage, however: the ACL Anthology, a
public repository of all papers in the Computational
Linguistics journal and the conferences and work-
shops associated with the ACL, COLING, EMNLP,
and so on. The ACL Anthology (Bird, 2008), and
comprises over 14,000 documents from conferences
and the journal, beginning as early as 1965 through
2008, indexed by conference and year. This re-
source has already been the basis of citation anal-
ysis work, for example, in the ACL Anthology Net-
work of Joseph and Radev (2007). We apply LDA
to the text of the papers in the ACL Anthology to
induce topics, and use the trends in these topics over
time and over conference venues to address ques-
tions about the development of the field.

Table 1: Data in the ACL Anthology
Despite the relative youth of our field, computa-
tional linguistics has witnessed a number of research
trends and shifts in focus. While some trends are
obvious (such as the rise in machine learning meth-
ods), others may be more subtle. Has the field got-
ten more theoretical over the years or has there been
an increase in applications? What topics have de-
clined over the years, and which ones have remained
roughly constant? How have fields like Dialogue or
Machine Translation changed over the years? Are
there differences among the conferences, for exam-
ple between COLING and ACL, in their interests
and breadth of focus? As our field matures, it is im-
portant to go beyond anecdotal description to give
grounded answers to these questions. Such answers
could also help give formal metrics to model the dif-
ferences between the many conferences and venues
in our field, which could influence how we think
about reviewing, about choosing conference topics,
and about long range planning in our field.
2 Methodology
2.1 Data
The analyses in this paper are based on a text-
only version of the Anthology that comprises some
12,500 papers. The distribution of the Anthology
data is shown in Table 1.
2.2 Topic Modeling
Our experiments employ Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA; Blei et al (2003)), a generative latent variable
model that treats documents as bags of words gener-
ated by one or more topics. Each document is char-
acterized by a multinomial distribution over topics,
and each topic is in turn characterized by a multino-
mial distribution over words. We perform parame-
ter estimation using collapsed Gibbs sampling (Grif-
fiths and Steyvers, 2004).
Possible extensions to this model would be to in-
tegrate topic modelling with citations (e.g., Dietz et
al. (2007), Mann et al (2006), and Jo et al (2007)).
Another option is the use of more fine-grained or hi-
erarchical model (e.g., Blei et al (2004), and Li and
McCallum (2006)).
All our studies measure change in various as-
pects of the ACL Anthology over time. LDA, how-
ever, does not explicitly model temporal relation-
ships. One way to model temporal relationships is
to employ an extension to LDA. The Dynamic Topic
Model (Blei and Lafferty, 2006), for example, rep-
resents each year?s documents as generated from a
normal distribution centroid over topics, with the
following year?s centroid generated from the pre-
ceding year?s. The Topics over Time Model (Wang
and McCallum, 2006) assumes that each document
chooses its own time stamp based on a topic-specific
beta distribution.
Both of these models, however, impose con-
straints on the time periods. The Dynamic Topic
Model penalizes large changes from year to year
while the beta distributions in Topics over Time are
relatively inflexible. We chose instead to perform
post hoc calculations based on the observed proba-
bility of each topic given the current year. We define
p?(z|y) as the empirical probability that an arbitrary
paper d written in year y was about topic z:
p?(z|y) =
?
d:td=y
p?(z|d)p?(d|y)
=
1
C
?
d:td=y
p?(z|d)
=
1
C
?
d:td=y
?
z?i?d
I(z?i = z)
(1)
where I is the indicator function, td is the date docu-
ment d was written, p?(d|y) is set to a constant 1/C.
3 Summary of Topics
We first ran LDA with 100 topics, and took 36 that
we found to be relevant. We then hand-selected seed

field. These 46 topics were then used as priors to a
new 100-topic run. The top ten most frequent words
for 43 of the topics along with hand-assigned labels
are listed in Table 2. Topics deriving from manual
seeds are marked with an asterisk.
4 Historical Trends in Computational
Linguistics
Given the space of possible topics defined in the pre-
vious section, we now examine the history of these
in the entire ACL Anthology from 1978 until 2006.
To visualize some trends, we show the probability
mass associated with various topics over time, plot-
ted as (a smoothed version of) p?(z|y).
4.1 Topics Becoming More Prominent
Figure 1 shows topics that have becomemore promi-
nent more recently.
Of these new topics, the rise in probabilistic mod-
els and classification/tagging is unsurprising. In or-
der to distinguish these two topics, we show 20 of
the strongly weighted words:

As Figure 1 shows, probabilistic models seem to
have arrived significantly before classifiers. The
probabilistic model topic increases around 1988,
which seems to have been an important year for
probabilistic models, including high-impact papers
like A88-1019 and C88-1016 below. The ten papers

bilistic model and classifier topics were the follow-

strong decline from 1978 to 2006.
probabilistic models and classifiers entered the
field? First, not surprisingly, we note that the vast
majority (9 of 10) of the papers appeared in con-
ference proceedings rather than the journal, con-
firming that in general new ideas appear in confer-
ences. Second, of the 9 conference papers, most
of them appeared in the COLING conference (5) or
the ANLP workshop (3) compared to only 1 in the
ACL conference. This suggests that COLING may
have been more receptive than ACL to new ideas
at the time, a point we return to in Section 6. Fi-
nally, we examined the background of the authors of
these papers. Six of the 10 papers either focus on
speech (C88-1010, A88-1028, C88-1071) or were
written by authors who had previously published on
speech recognition topics, including the influential
IBM (Brown et al) and AT&T (Church) labs (C88-
1016, A88-1005, A88-1019). Speech recognition
is historically an electrical engineering field which
made quite early use of probabilistic and statistical
methodologies. This suggests that researchers work-
ing on spoken language processing were an impor-
tant conduit for the borrowing of statistical method-
ologies into computational linguistics.
4.2 Topics That Have Declined
Figure 2 shows several topics that were more promi-
nent at the beginning of the ACL but which have
shown the most precipitous decline. Papers strongly

The declines in both computational semantics and
conceptual semantics/story understanding suggests
that it is possible that the entire field of natural lan-
guage understanding and computational semantics
broadly construed has fallen out of favor. To see
if this was in fact the case we created a metatopic
called semantics in which we combined various se-
mantics topics (not including pragmatic topics like
anaphora resolution or discourse coherence) includ-
ing: lexical semantics, conceptual semantics/story

and events/temporal. We then plotted p?(z ? S|y),
the sum of the proportions per year for these top-
ics, as shown in Figure 3. The steep decrease in se-
mantics is readily apparent. The last few years has
shown a levelling off of the decline, and possibly a
revival of this topic; this possibility will need to be
confirmed as we add data from 2007 and 2008.
We next chose two fields, Dialogue and Machine
Translation, in which it seemed to us that the topics
discovered by LDA suggested a shift in paradigms in
these fields. Figure 4 shows the shift in translation,
while Figure 5 shows the change in dialogue.
The shift toward statistical machine translation is
well known, at least anecdotally. The shift in di-
alogue seems to be a move toward more applied,
speech-oriented, or commercial dialogue systems
and away from more theoretical models.
Finally, Figure 6 shows the history of several top-
ics that peaked at intermediate points throughout the
history of the field. We can see the peak of unifica-
tion around 1990, of syntactic structure around 1985
of automata in 1985 and again in 1997, and of word
sense disambiguation around 1998.
5 Is Computational Linguistics Becoming
More Applied?
We don?t know whether our field is becoming more
applied, or whether perhaps there is a trend to-
wards new but unapplied theories. We therefore

Figure 8: Six applied topics over time
looked at trends over time for the following appli-
cations: Machine Translation, Spelling Correction,
Dialogue Systems, Information Retrieval, Call Rout-
ing, Speech Recognition, and Biomedical applica-
tions.
Figure 7 shows a clear trend toward an increase
in applications over time. The figure also shows an
interesting bump near 1990. Why was there such
a sharp temporary increase in applications at that
time? Figure 8 shows details for each application,
making it clear that the bump is caused by a tempo-
rary spike in the Speech Recognition topic.
In order to understand why we see this temporary
spike, Figure 9 shows the unsmoothed values of the
Speech Recognition topic prominence over time.
Figure 9 clearly shows a huge spike for the years
1989?1994. These years correspond exactly to the

Figure 9: Speech recognition over time
held at different locations from 1989?1994. That
workshop contained a significant amount of speech
until its last year (1994), and then it was revived
in 2001 as the Human Language Technology work-
shop with a much smaller emphasis on speech pro-
cessing. It is clear from Figure 9 that there is still
some speech research appearing in the Anthology
after 1995, certainly more than the period before
1989, but it?s equally clear that speech recognition
is not an application that the ACL community has
been successful at attracting.
6 Differences and Similarities Among
COLING, ACL, and EMNLP
The computational linguistics community has two
distinct conferences, COLING and ACL, with dif-
ferent histories, organizing bodies, and philoso-
phies. Traditionally, COLING was larger, with par-
allel sessions and presumably a wide variety of top-
ics, while ACL had single sessions and a more nar-
row scope. In recent years, however, ACL has
moved to parallel sessions, and the conferences are
of similar size. Has the distinction in breadth of top-
ics also been blurred? What are the differences and
similarities in topics and trends between these two
conferences?
More recently, the EMNLP conference grew out
of the Workshop on Very Large Corpora, sponsored
by the Special Interest Group on Linguistic Data
and corpus-based approaches to NLP (SIGDAT).
EMNLP started as a much smaller and narrower
369
conference but more recently, while still smaller
than both COLING and ACL, it has grown large
enough to be considered with them. How does the
breadth of its topics compare with the others?
Our hypothesis, based on our intuitions as con-
ference attendees, is that ACL is still more narrow
in scope than COLING, but has broadened consid-
erably. Similarly, our hypothesis is that EMNLP has
begun to broaden considerably as well, although not
to the extent of the other two.
In addition, we?re interested in whether the topics
of these conferences are converging or not. Are the
probabilistic and machine learning trends that are
dominant in ACL becoming dominant in COLING
as well? Is EMNLP adopting some of the topics that
are popular at COLING?
To investigate both of these questions, we need a
model of the topic distribution for each conference.
We define the empirical distribution of a topic z at a
conference c, denoted by p?(z|c) by:
p?(z|c) =
?
d:cd=c
p?(z|d)p?(d|c)
=
1
C
?
d:cd=c
p?(z|d)
=
1
C
?
d:cd=c
?
z?i?d
I(z?i = z)
(2)
We also condition on the year for each conference,
giving us p?(z|y, c).
We propose to measure the breadth of a confer-
ence by using what we call topic entropy: the condi-
tional entropy of this conference topic distribution.
Entropy measures the average amount of informa-
tion expressed by each assignment to a random vari-
able. If a conference has higher topic entropy, then it
more evenly divides its probability mass across the
generated topics. If it has lower, it has a far more
narrow focus on just a couple of topics. We there-
fore measured topic entropy:

Figure 10: Entropy of the three major conferences per
year
and COLING are colocated (1984, 1998, 2006),
and marked those colocated years as points separate
from either plot. As expected, COLING has been
historically the broadest of the three conferences,
though perhaps slightly less so in recent years. ACL
started with a fairly narrow focus, but became nearly
as broad as COLING during the 1990?s. However, in
the past 8 years it has become more narrow again,
with a steeper decline in breadth than COLING.
EMNLP, true to its status as a ?Special Interest? con-
ference, began as a very narrowly focused confer-
ence, but now it seems to be catching up to at least
ACL in terms of the breadth of its focus.
Since the three major conferences seem to be con-
verging in terms of breadth, we investigated whether
or not the topic distributions of the conferences were
also converging. To do this, we plotted the Jensen-
Shannon (JS) divergence between each pair of con-
ferences. The Jensen-Shannon divergence is a sym-
metric measure of the similarity of two pairs of dis-
tributions. The measure is 0 only for identical dis-
tributions and approaches infinity as the two differ
more and more. Formally, it is defined as the aver-
age of the KL divergence of each distribution to the
average of the two distributions:

Figure 11: JS Divergence between the three major con-
ferences
and COLING have historically met very infre-
quently in the same year, so those similarity scores
are plotted as points and not smoothed. The trend
across all three conferences is clear: each confer-
ence is not only increasing in breadth, but also in
similarity. In particular, EMNLP and ACL?s differ-
ences, once significant, are nearly erased.
7 Conclusion
Our method discovers a number of trends in the
field, such as the general increase in applications,
the steady decline in semantics, and its possible re-
versal. We also showed a convergence over time in
topic coverage of ACL, COLING, and EMNLP as
well an expansion of topic diversity. This growth
and convergence of the three conferences, perhaps
influenced by the need to increase recall (Church,
2005) seems to be leading toward a tripartite real-
ization of a single new ?latent? conference.
