we experimented with two levels of distortion: monotonic, where the phrasal alignment is monotonic (but word reordering is still possible within a phrase) and limited distortion, where only adjacent phrases are allowed to exchange positions (zens and ney, 2004). 
(zens and ney, 2004) describe a noisy-or combination: p(sj|Ëœt) = 1âˆ’p(Â¯sj|Ëœt) â‰ˆ 1âˆ’ Ëœiproductdisplay i=1 (1âˆ’p(sj|ti)) where Â¯sj is the probability that sj is not in the translation of Ëœt, and p(sj|ti) is a lexical probability. 
more details about the baseline system can be found in (zens and ney, 2004; zens et al, 2005). 
we use a state-of-the-art phrase-based translation system as described in (zens and ney, 2004; zens et al, 2005). 
finally, we use pos features to parameterize a distortion model in a limited distortion decoder (zens and ney, 2004; tillmann and zhang, 2005).
